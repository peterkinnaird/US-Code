I21In subsection (b), the words ``in conformity with section 201(e)'', which appeared at the end of the subsection, are omitted as obsolete. Section 201 of Public Law 85ÿ09568, which was classified to former section 2471 of title 42 (last appearing in the 1970 edition of the United States Code), established the National Aeronautics and Space Council, with the functions of the Council specified in section 201(e). Those functions included advising the President ``as he may request'' with respect to promoting cooperation and resolving differences among agencies of the United States engaged in aeronautical and space activities. The words are obsolete because section 3(a)(4) of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1973 (5 App. U.S.C.), abolished the National Aeronautics and Space Council, including the office of Executive Secretary of the Council, together with its functions.

I21In subsection (c), the words ``(as established by title II of this Act)'', which appeared after ``Administration'', are omitted as unnecessary.

I21In subsection (d), the word ``and'', appearing at the end of paragraph (8), is omitted as unnecessary because of the introductory words ``one or more of the following''.

Q04

I11(b) T4Exclusive Property of United States._

I12(1) T4In generalK._An invention shall be the exclusive property of the United States if it is made in the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration, and the Administrator determines that_

I13(A) the person who made the invention was employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work and the invention is related to the work the person was employed or assigned to perform, or was within the scope of the person's employment duties, whether or not it was made during working hours, or with a contribution by the Government of the use of Government facilities, equipment, materials, allocated funds, information proprietary to the Government, or services of Government employees during working hours; or

I13(B) the person who made the invention was not employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work, but the invention is nevertheless related to the contract, or to the work or duties the person was employed or assigned to perform, and was made during working hours, or with a contribution from the Government of the sort referred to in subparagraph (A).

Q04

I12(2) T4Patent to united statesK._If an invention is the exclusive property of the United States under paragraph (1), and if such invention is patentable, a patent therefor shall be issued to the United States upon application made by the Administrator, unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States to such invention in conformity with the provisions of subsection (g).

Q04

I11(c) T4Contract Provisions for Furnishing Reports of Inventions, Discoveries, Improvements, or InnovationsK._Each contract entered into by the Administrator with any party for the performance of any work shall contain effective provisions under which the party shall furnish promptly to the Administrator a written report containing full and complete technical information concerning any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation which may be made in the performance of any such work.

I11(d) T4Patent ApplicationK._No patent may be issued to any applicant other than the Administrator for any invention which appears to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Director'') to have significant utility in the conduct of aeronautical and space activities unless the applicant files with the Director, with the application or within 30 days after request therefor by the Director, a written statement executed under oath setting forth the full facts concerning the circumstances under which the invention was made and stating the relationship (if any) of the invention to the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration. Copies of each such statement and the application to which it relates shall be transmitted forthwith by the Director to the Administrator.

I11(e) T4Issuance of Patent to ApplicantK._Upon any application as to which any such statement has been transmitted to the Administrator, the Director may, if the invention is patentable, issue a patent to the applicant unless the Administrator, within 90 days after receipt of the application and statement, requests that the patent be issued to the Administrator on behalf of the United States. If, within such time, the Administrator files such a request with the Director, the Director shall transmit notice thereof to the applicant, and shall issue such patent to the Administrator unless the applicant within 30 days after receipt of the notice requests a hearing before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on the question whether the Administrator is entitled under this section to receive the patent. The Board may hear and determine, in accordance with rules and procedures established for interference and derivation cases, the question so presented, and its determination shall be subject to appeal by the applicant or by the Administrator to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with procedures governing appeals from decisions of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in other proceedings.

Notice of any such request shall be transmitted by the Director to the owner of record of the patent, and title to the patent shall be so transferred to the Administrator unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice, the owner of record requests a hearing before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on the question whether any such false representation was contained in the statement filed in connection with the patent. The question shall be heard and determined, and the determination shall be subject to review, in the manner prescribed by subsection (e) for questions arising thereunder. A request made by the Administrator under this subsection for the transfer of title to a patent, and prosecution for the violation of any criminal statute, shall not be barred by the failure of the Administrator to make a request under subsection (e) for the issuance of the patent to the Administrator, or by any notice previously given by the Administrator stating that the Administrator had no objection to the issuance of the patent to the applicant.

Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the interests of the United States. Each such waiver made with respect to any invention shall be subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the United States. Each proposal for any waiver under this subsection shall be referred to an Inventions and Contributions Board which shall be established by the Administrator within the Administration. Such Board shall accord to each interested party an opportunity for hearing, and shall transmit to the Administrator its findings of fact with respect to such proposal and its recommendations for action to be taken with respect thereto.

I11(h) T4Protection of TitleK._The Administrator is authorized to take all suitable and necessary steps to protect any invention or discovery to which the Administrator has title, and to require contractors or persons who retain title to inventions or discoveries under this section to protect the inventions or discoveries to which the Administration has or may acquire a license of use.

I21In subsection (d)(3), the words ``without regard to the date on which the Administration entered into the waiver'' are substituted for ``without regard to whether it was entered into before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act'' to avoid an ambiguity in the law. Literally, the words ``the date of enactment of this Act'' mean July 29, 1958, the date of enactment of Public Law 85ÿ09568. However, the intended meaning of the words ``the date of enactment of this Act'' is probably October 20, 1999, the date of enactment of Public Law 106ÿ0974.

I21Memorandum of President of the United States, May 3, 2010, 75 F.R. 24781, provided:

I21Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[,] the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Education[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Administrator of the Small Business Administration[,] the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[,] the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers[,] the Director of National Intelligence[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[, and] the Director of the National Economic Council

I21My Administration is committed to implementing a bold, new approach to human spaceflight. Supported by a $6 billion increase to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) budget over the next 5 years, this strategy will foster the development of path-breaking technologies, increase the reach and reduce the cost of human and robotic exploration of space, and help create thousands of new jobs.

I21NASA's budget also includes $429 million next year, and $1.9 billion over the next 5 years, to modernize the Kennedy Space Center and other nearby space launch facilities in Florida. This modernization effort will help spur new commercial business and innovation and provide additional good jobs to the region. While all of the new aspects of my Administration's plan together will create thousands of new jobs in Florida, past decisions to end the Space Shuttle program will still affect families and communities along Florida's ``Space Coast.''

I21Building on this significant new investment at the Kennedy Space Center and my increased budget for NASA overall, I am committed to taking additional steps to help local economies like Florida's Space Coast adapt and thrive in the years ahead. The men and women who work in Florida's aerospace industry are some of the most talented and highly trained in the Nation. It is critical that their skills are tapped as we transform and expand the country's space exploration efforts. That is why I am launching a $40 million, multi-agency initiative to help the Space Coast transform their economies and prepare their workers for the opportunities of tomorrow. This effort will build on and complement ongoing local and Federal economic and workforce-development efforts through a Task Force composed of senior-level Administration officials from relevant agencies that will construct an economic development action plan by August 15, 2010.

I21To these ends, I hereby direct the following:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3Establishment of the Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic DevelopmentK. There is established a Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development (Task Force) to develop, in collaboration with local stakeholders, an interagency action plan to facilitate economic development strategies and plans along the Space Coast and to provide training and other opportunities for affected aerospace workers so they are equipped to contribute to new developments in America's space program and related industries. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Task Force.

I21(a) T3Membership of the Task ForceK. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:

I21(i) the Secretary of Defense;

I21(ii) the Secretary of Labor;

I21(iii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;

I21(iv) the Secretary of Transportation;

I21(v) the Secretary of Education;

I21(vi) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;

I21(xi) the Director of the National Economic Council; and

I21(xii) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the President may, from time to time, designate.

I21A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, a senior-level official who is a part of the member's department, agency, or office, and who is a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government.

I21(b) T3AdministrationK. The Co-Chairs shall convene regular meetings of the Task Force, determine its agenda, and direct its work. At the direction of the Co-Chairs, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees, as appropriate.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3Mission and FunctionsK. The Task Force shall work with local stakeholders and executive departments and agencies to equip Space Coast and other affected workers to take advantage of new opportunities and expand the region's economic base.

I21The Task Force will perform the following functions, to the extent permitted by law:

I21(a) provide leadership and coordination of Federal Government resources to facilitate workforce and economic development opportunities for aerospace communities and workers affected by new developments in America's space exploration program. Such support may include the use of personnel, technical expertise, and available financial resources, and may be used to provide a coordinated Federal response to the needs of individual States, regions, municipalities, and communities adversely affected by space industry changes;

I21(b) provide recommendations to the President on ways Federal policies and programs can address issues of special importance to aerospace communities and workers; and

I21(c) help ensure that officials from throughout the executive branch, including officials on existing committees or task forces addressing technological development, research, or aerospace issues, advance the President's agenda for the transformation of America's space exploration program and support the coordination of Federal economic adjustment assistance activities.

I21T4SecK. 3. T3OutreachK. Consistent with the objectives set forth in this memorandum, the Task Force, in accordance with applicable law, in addition to holding regular meetings, shall conduct outreach to representatives of nonprofit organizations; business; labor[;] State, local, and tribal governments; elected officials; and other interested persons that will assist in bringing to the President's attention concerns, ideas, and policy options for expanding and improving efforts to create jobs and economic growth in affected aerospace communities. The Task Force shall hold inaugural meetings with stakeholders within 60 days of the date of this memorandum.

I21T4SecK. 4. T3Task Force Plan for Space Industry Workforce and Economic DevelopmentK. On or before August 15, 2010, the Task Force shall develop and submit to the President a comprehensive plan that:

I21(a) recommends how best to invest $40 million in transition assistance funding to ensure robust workforce and economic development in those communities within Florida affected by transitions in America's space exploration program;

I21(b) describes how the plan will build on and complement ongoing economic and workforce development efforts;

I21(c) explores future workforce and economic development activities that could be undertaken for affected aerospace communities in other States, as appropriate;

I21(d) identifies areas of collaboration with other public or nongovernmental actors to achieve the objectives of the Task Force; and

I21(e) details a coordinated implementation strategy by executive departments and agencies to meet the objectives of the Task Force.

I21Pub. L. 107ÿ09248, title IX, ÿ1A902, Oct. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 1573, provided that: ``Congress makes the following findings:

I22``(1) It is in the national interest to encourage the production of cost-effective, in-space transportation systems, which would be built and operated by the private sector on a commercial basis.

I22``(2) The use of reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance performance levels of in-space operations, enhance efficient and safe disposal of satellites at the end of their useful lives, and increase the capability and reliability of existing ground-to-space launch vehicles.

I22``(3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance the economic well-being and national security of the United States by reducing space operations costs for commercial and national space programs and by adding new space capabilities to space operations.

I22``(4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will provide new cost-effective space capabilities (including orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high altitude orbits and return, the correction of erroneous satellite orbits, and the recovery, refurbishment, and refueling of satellites) and the provision of upper stage functions to increase ground-to-orbit launch vehicle payloads to geostationary and other high energy orbits.

I22``(5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival deceleration to support potential National Aeronautics and Space Administration missions to Mars, Pluto, and other planets.

I22``(6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbit due to deficiencies in their launch represent substantial economic loss to the United States and present substantial concerns for the current backlog of national space assets.

I22``(7) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can provide new options for alternative planning approaches and risk management to enhance the mission assurance of national space assets.

I22``(8) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems developed by the private sector can provide in-space transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, the National Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need for the United States to bear the cost of production of such systems.

I22``(9) The availability of loan guarantees, with the cost of credit risk to the United States paid by the private-sector, is an effective means by which the United States can help qualifying private-sector companies secure otherwise unattainable private financing for the production of commercial reusable in-space transportation systems, while at the same time minimizing Government commitment and involvement in the development of such systems.''

I21Pub. L. 102ÿ09588, title V, ÿ1A501, Nov. 4, 1992, 106 Stat. 5122, provided that: ``The Congress finds that_

I22``(1) commercial activities of the private sector have substantially contributed to the strength of both the United States space program and the national economy;

I22``(2) a robust United States space transportation capability remains a vital cornerstone of the United States space program;

I22``(3) the availability of commercial launch services is essential for the continued growth of the United States commercial space sector;

I22``(4) a timely extension of the excess third party claims payment provisions of the Commercial Space Launch Act [now 51 U.S.C. 50901 et seq.] is appropriate and necessary to enable the private sector to continue covering maximum probable liability risks while protecting the private sector from uninsurable levels of liability which could hinder international competitiveness;

I22``(5) a program to demonstrate how recipients of Federal grants can purchase launch services directly from the private sector has the potential to improve the capabilities of the United States commercial launch industry;

I22``(6) improvements and additions to the Nation's space transportation infrastructure contribute to a robust and cost effective space transportation capability for both public sector and private sector users;

I22``(7) private sector use of available Government facilities on a reimbursable basis contributes to a stronger commercial space sector;

I22``(8) the Federal Government should purchase space goods and services which are commercially available, or could be made available commercially in response to a Government procurement request, whenever such goods or services meet Government mission requirements in a cost effective manner;

I22``(9) it is appropriate for the Government to act as an anchor tenant for commercial space development projects which have a reasonable potential to develop non-Federal markets and which meet Federal needs in a cost effective manner; and

I22``(10) the provision of compensation to commercial providers of space goods and services for termination of contracts at the convenience of the Government assists in enabling the private sector to invest in space activities which are initially dependent on Government purchases.''

I89. Findings and purposes

I11(a) T4FindingsK._Congress finds that_

I12(1) the peaceful uses of outer space continue to be of great value and to offer benefits to all mankind;

I12(2) private applications of space technology have achieved a significant level of commercial and economic activity and offer the potential for growth in the future, particularly in the United States;

I12(3) new and innovative equipment and services are being sought, produced, and offered by entrepreneurs in telecommunications, information services, microgravity research, human space flight, and remote sensing technologies;

I12(4) the private sector in the United States has the capability of developing and providing private launching, reentry, and associated services that would complement the launching, reentry, and associated capabilities of the United States Government;

I12(5) the development of commercial launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services would enable the United States to retain its competitive position internationally, contributing to the national interest and economic well-being of the United States;

I12(6) providing launch services and reentry services by the private sector is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and would be facilitated by stable, minimal, and appropriate regulatory guidelines that are fairly and expeditiously applied;

I12(7) the United States should encourage private sector launches, reentries, and associated services and, only to the extent necessary, regulate those launches, reentries, and services to ensure compliance with international obligations of the United States and to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States;

I12(8) space transportation, including the establishment and operation of launch sites, reentry sites, and complementary facilities, the providing of launch services and reentry services, the establishment of support facilities, and the providing of support services, is an important element of the transportation system of the United States, and in connection with the commerce of the United States there is a need to develop a strong space transportation infrastructure with significant private sector involvement;

I12(9) the participation of State governments in encouraging and facilitating private sector involvement in space-related activity, particularly through the establishment of a space transportation-related infrastructure, including launch sites, reentry sites, complementary facilities, and launch site and reentry site support facilities, is in the national interest and is of significant public benefit;

I12(10) the goal of safely opening space to the American people and their private commercial, scientific, and cultural enterprises should guide Federal space investments, policies, and regulations;

I12(11) private industry has begun to develop commercial launch vehicles capable of carrying human beings into space and greater private investment in these efforts will stimulate the Nation's commercial space transportation industry as a whole;

I12(12) space transportation is inherently risky, and the future of the commercial human space flight industry will depend on its ability to continually improve its safety performance;

I12(13) a critical area of responsibility for the Department of Transportation is to regulate the operations and safety of the emerging commercial human space flight industry;

I12(14) the public interest is served by creating a clear legal, regulatory, and safety regime for commercial human space flight; and

I12(15) the regulatory standards governing human space flight must evolve as the industry matures so that regulations neither stifle technology development nor expose crew or space flight participants to avoidable risks as the public comes to expect greater safety for crew and space flight participants from the industry.

Q04

I11(b) T4PurposesK._The purposes of this chapter are_

I12(1) to promote economic growth and entrepreneurial activity through use of the space environment for peaceful purposes;

I12(2) to encourage the United States private sector to provide launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services by_

I13(A) simplifying and expediting the issuance and transfer of commercial licenses;

I13(B) facilitating and encouraging the use of Government-developed space technology; and

I13(C) promoting the continuous improvement of the safety of launch vehicles designed to carry humans, including through the issuance of regulations, to the extent permitted by this chapter;

Q04

I12(3) to provide that the Secretary of Transportation is to oversee and coordinate the conduct of commercial launch and reentry operations, issue permits and commercial licenses and transfer commercial licenses authorizing those operations, and protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States; and

I12(4) to facilitate the strengthening and expansion of the United States space transportation infrastructure, including the enhancement of United States launch sites and launch-site support facilities, and development of reentry sites, with Government, State, and private sector involvement, to support the full range of United States space-related activities.

I12(C) contractors, subcontractors, and customers of the licensee or transferee.

I11(d) T4Surveys, Reports, and Compensation PlansK._(1) If as a result of an activity carried out under a license issued or transferred under this chapter the total of claims related to one launch or reentry is likely to be more than the amount of required insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the Secretary shall_

I12(A) survey the causes and extent of damage; and

I12(B) submit expeditiously to Congress a report on the results of the survey.

I12(A) outlines the total dollar value of the claims;

I12(B) recommends sources of amounts to pay for the claims;

I12(B) does not include a resolution that includes more than one compensation plan.

Q04

I11(2) The Senate shall consider under this subsection a compensation plan requiring additional appropriations or legislative authority not later than 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is submitted to Congress.

I11(3) A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred immediately to a committee by the President of the Senate. All resolutions related to the same plan shall be referred to the same committee.

I11(4)(A) If the committee of the Senate to which a resolution has been referred does not report the resolution within 20 calendar days after it is referred, a motion is in order to discharge the committee from further consideration of the resolution or to discharge the committee from further consideration of the plan.

I11(B) A motion to discharge may be made only by an individual favoring the resolution and is highly privileged (except that the motion may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution on the plan). Debate on the motion is limited to one hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order.

A motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.

I11(6) The following shall be decided in the Senate without debate:

I12(A) a motion to postpone related to the discharge from committee.

I12(B) a motion to postpone consideration of a resolution.

I12(C) a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business.

I12(D) an appeal from a decision of the chair related to the application of the rules of the Senate to the procedures related to a resolution.

I11(a) T4PolicyK._It is the policy of the United States that projects selected under this chapter shall provide for the protection and enhancement of the natural resources and the quality of the environment of the United States. In carrying out this policy, the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency about a project that may have a significant effect on natural resources, including fish and wildlife, natural, scenic, and recreational assets, water and air quality, and other factors affecting the environment. If the Secretary of Transportation finds that a project will have a significant adverse effect, the Secretary may approve the application for the project only if, after a complete review that is a matter of public record, the Secretary makes a written finding that no feasible and prudent alternative to the project exists and that all reasonable steps have been taken to minimize the adverse effect.

I11(b) T4Public Hearing RequirementK._The Secretary of Transportation may approve an application only if the sponsor of the project certifies to the Secretary that an opportunity for a public hearing has been provided to consider the economic, social, and environmental effects of the project and its consistency with the goals of any planning carried out by the community. When a hearing is held under this paragraph, the sponsor shall submit a copy of the transcript of the hearing to the Secretary.

I11(c) T4Compliance With Air and Water Quality StandardsK._(1) The Secretary of Transportation may approve an application only if the chief executive officer of the State in which the project is located certifies in writing to the Secretary that there is reasonable assurance that the project will be located, designed, constructed, and operated to comply with applicable air and water quality standards. If the Administrator has not prescribed those standards, certification shall be obtained from the Administrator. Notice of certification or refusal to certify shall be provided not later than 60 days after the Secretary receives the application.

I11(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall condition the approval of an application on compliance with applicable air and water quality standards during construction and operation.

I11(d) T4Compliance With Laws and RegulationsK._The Secretary of Transportation may require a certification from a sponsor that the sponsor will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

I74Findings

I21Pub. L. 102ÿ09555, ÿ1A2, Oct. 28, 1992, 106 Stat. 4163, provided that: ``The Congress finds and declares the following:

I22``(1) The continuous collection and utilization of land remote sensing data from space are of major benefit in studying and understanding human impacts on the global environment, in managing the Earth's natural resources, in carrying out national security functions, and in planning and conducting many other activities of scientific, economic, and social importance.

I22``(2) The Federal Government's Landsat system established the United States as the world leader in land remote sensing technology.

I22``(3) The national interest of the United States lies in maintaining international leadership in satellite land remote sensing and in broadly promoting the beneficial use of remote sensing data.

I22``(4) The cost of Landsat data has impeded the use of such data for scientific purposes, such as for global environmental change research, as well as for other public sector applications.

I22``(5) Given the importance of the Landsat program to the United States, urgent actions, including expedited procurement procedures, are required to ensure data continuity.

I22``(6) Full commercialization of the Landsat program cannot be achieved within the foreseeable future, and thus should not serve as the near-term goal of national policy on land remote sensing; however, commercialization of land remote sensing should remain a long-term goal of United States policy.

I22``(7) Despite the success and importance of the Landsat system, funding and organizational uncertainties over the past several years have placed its future in doubt and have jeopardized United States leadership in land remote sensing.

I22``(8) Recognizing the importance of the Landsat program in helping to meet national and commercial objectives, the President approved, on February 11, 1992, a National Space Policy Directive which was developed by the National Space Council and commits the United States to ensuring the continuity of Landsat coverage into the 21st century.

I22``(9) Because Landsat data are particularly important for national security purposes and global environmental change research, management responsibilities for the program should be transferred from the Department of Commerce to an integrated program management involving the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

I22``(10) Regardless of management responsibilities for the Landsat program, the Nation's broad civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign policy interests in remote sensing will best be served by ensuring that Landsat remains an unclassified program that operates according to the principles of open skies and nondiscriminatory access.

I22``(11) Technological advances aimed at reducing the size and weight of satellite systems hold the potential for dramatic reductions in the cost, and substantial improvements in the capabilities, of future land remote sensing systems, but such technological advances have not been demonstrated for land remote sensing and therefore cannot be relied upon as the sole means of achieving data continuity for the Landsat program.

I22``(12) A technology demonstration program involving advanced remote sensing technologies could serve a vital role in determining the design of a follow-on spacecraft to Landsat 7, while also helping to determine whether such a spacecraft should be funded by the United States Government, by the private sector, or by an international consortium.

I22``(13) To maximize the value of the Landsat program to the American public, unenhanced Landsat 4 through 6 data should be made available, at a minimum, to United States Government agencies, to global environmental change researchers, and to other researchers who are financially supported by the United States Government, at the cost of fulfilling user requests, and unenhanced Landsat 7 data should be made available to all users at the cost of fulfilling user requests.

I22``(14) To stimulate development of the commercial market for unenhanced data and value-added services, the United States Government should adopt a data policy for Landsat 7 which allows competition within the private sector for distribution of unenhanced data and value-added services.

I22``(15) Development of the remote sensing market and the provision of commercial value-added services based on remote sensing data should remain exclusively the function of the private sector.

I22``(16) It is in the best interest of the United States to maintain a permanent, comprehensive Government archive of global Landsat and other land remote sensing data for long-term monitoring and study of the changing global environment.''

I12(2) demonstrate within such 5-year period advanced sensor capabilities suitable for use in the anticipated land remote sensing program; and

I12(3) demonstrate within such 5-year period an advanced land remote sensing system design that could be less expensive to procure and operate than the Landsat system projected to be in operation through the year 2000, and that therefore holds greater potential for private sector investment and control.

Q04

I11(b) T4Execution of ProgramK._In executing the technology demonstration program, the President shall seek to apply technologies associated with United States National Technical Means of intelligence gathering, to the extent that such technologies are appropriate for the technology demonstration and can be declassified for such purposes without causing adverse harm to United States national security interests.

I11(c) T4Broad ApplicationK._To the greatest extent practicable, the technology demonstration program established under subsection (a) shall be designed to be responsive to the broad civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign policy needs of the United States.

I11(d) T4Private Sector FundingK._The technology demonstration program under this section may be carried out in part with private sector funding.

I11(e) T4Landsat Program Management CoordinationK._The Landsat Program Management shall have a coordinating role in the technology demonstration program carried out under this section.

I22``(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.

I22``(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and pose a similar threat in the future.

I22``(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects' closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.

I22``(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.

It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 2005].

I23``(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.

I23``(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.

I22``(4) T4Initial reportK._The Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act an initial report that provides the following:

I23``(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.

I22``(3) Asteroid and comet collisions rank as one of the most costly natural disasters that can occur.

I22``(4) The time needed to eliminate or mitigate the threat of a collision of a potentially hazardous near-Earth object with Earth is measured in decades.

I22``(5) Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets can provide adequate collision information, enabling the United States to include both asteroid-collision and comet-collision disaster recovery and disaster avoidance in its public-safety structure.

I22``(6) Basic information is needed for technical and policy decisionmaking for the United States to create a comprehensive program in order to be ready to eliminate and mitigate the serious and credible threats to humankind posed by potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets.

I22``(7) As a first step to eliminate and to mitigate the risk of such collisions, situation and decision analysis processes, as well as procedures and system resources, must be in place well before a collision threat becomes known.''
