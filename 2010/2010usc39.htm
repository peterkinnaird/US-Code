<p class="statutory-body">(c) As an employer, the Postal Service shall achieve and maintain compensation for its officers and employees comparable to the rates and types of compensation paid in the private sector of the economy of the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) In determining all policies for postal services, the Postal Service shall give the highest consideration to the requirement for the most expeditious collection, transportation, and delivery of important letter mail.</p>

Modern methods of transporting mail by containerization and programs designed to achieve overnight transportation to the destination of important letter mail to all parts of the Nation shall be a primary goal of postal operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In planning and building new postal facilities, the Postal Service shall emphasize the need for facilities and equipment designed to create desirable working conditions for its officers and employees, a maximum degree of convenience for efficient postal services, proper access to existing and future air and surface transportation facilities, and control of costs to the Postal Service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to authorize the issuance of a substitute check for a lost, stolen, or destroyed check of the Postal Service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as otherwise provided, the Governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail and reasonable and equitable rates of postage and fees for postal services in accordance with the provisions of chapter 36. Postal rates and fees shall be reasonable and equitable and sufficient to enable the Postal Service, under best practices of honest, efficient, and economical management, to maintain and continue the development of postal services of the kind and quality adapted to the needs of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Postal Service shall maintain one or more classes of mail for the transmission of letters sealed against inspection. The rate for each such class shall be uniform throughout the United States, its territories, and possessions. One such class shall provide for the most expeditious handling and transportation afforded mail matter by the Postal Service. No letter of such a class of domestic origin shall be opened except under authority of a search warrant authorized by law, or by an officer or employee of the Postal Service for the sole purpose of determining an address at which the letter can be delivered, or pursuant to the authorization of the addressee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The Postal Service, prior to making a determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section as to the necessity for the closing or consolidation of any post office, shall provide adequate notice of its intention to close or consolidate such post office at least 60 days prior to the proposed date of such closing or consolidation to persons served by such post office to ensure that such persons will have an opportunity to present their views.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Postal Service, in making a determination whether or not to close or consolidate a post office&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the effect of such closing or consolidation on the community served by such post office;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the effect of such closing or consolidation on employees of the Postal Service employed at such office;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) whether such closing or consolidation is consistent with the policy of the Government, as stated in section 101(b) of this title, that the Postal Service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the economic savings to the Postal Service resulting from such closing or consolidation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) such other factors as the Postal Service determines are necessary; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any determination of the Postal Service to close or consolidate a post office shall be in writing and shall include the findings of the Postal Service with respect to the considerations required to be made under paragraph (2) of this subsection. Such determination and findings shall be made available to persons served by such post office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Postal Service shall take no action to close or consolidate a post office until 60 days after its written determination is made available to persons served by such post office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A determination of the Postal Service to close or consolidate any post office may be appealed by any person served by such office to the Postal Regulatory Commission within 30 days after such determination is made available to such person under paragraph (3). The Commission shall review such determination on the basis of the record before the Postal Service in the making of such determination. The Commission shall make a determination based upon such review no later than 120 days after receiving any appeal under this paragraph. The Commission shall set aside any determination, findings, and conclusions found to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without observance of procedure required by law; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) unsupported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commission may affirm the determination of the Postal Service or order that the entire matter be returned for further consideration, but the Commission may not modify the determination of the Postal Service. The Commission may suspend the effectiveness of the determination of the Postal Service until the final disposition of the appeal. The provisions of section 556, section 557, and chapter 7 of title 5 shall not apply to any review carried out by the Commission under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of paragraph (5), any appeal received by the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if sent to the Commission through the mails, be considered to have been received on <!-- PDFPage:16 -->the date of the Postal Service postmark on the envelope or other cover in which such appeal is mailed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if otherwise lawfully delivered to the Commission, be considered to have been received on the date determined based on any appropriate documentation or other indicia (as determined under regulations of the Commission).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;nonpostal service&rdquo; means any service that is not a postal service defined under section 102(5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this section shall be considered to permit or require that the Postal Service provide any nonpostal service, except that the Postal Service may provide nonpostal services which were offered as of January 1, 2006, as provided under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall review each nonpostal service offered by the Postal Service on the date of enactment of that Act and determine whether that nonpostal service shall continue, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the public need for the service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the ability of the private sector to meet the public need for the service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any nonpostal service not determined to be continued by the Postal Regulatory Commission under paragraph (3) shall terminate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Postal Regulatory Commission authorizes the Postal Service to continue a nonpostal service under this subsection, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall designate whether the service shall be regulated under this title as a market dominant product, a competitive product, or an experimental product.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to promote and encourage a clear distinction between governmental and operational responsibilities with respect to the provision of international postal services and other international delivery services by the Government of the United States and by intergovernmental organizations of which the United States is a member; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to participate in multilateral and bilateral agreements with other countries to accomplish these objectives.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary of State shall be responsible for formulation, coordination, and oversight of foreign policy related to international postal services and other international delivery services and shall have the power to conclude postal treaties, conventions, and amendments related to international postal services and other international delivery services, except that the Secretary may not conclude any treaty, convention, or other international agreement (including those regulating international postal services) if such treaty, convention, or agreement would, with respect to any competitive product, grant an undue or unreasonable preference to the Postal Service, a private provider of international postal or delivery services, or any other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out the responsibilities specified in paragraph (1), the Secretary of State shall exercise primary authority for the conduct of foreign policy with respect to international postal services and international delivery services, including the determination of United States positions and the conduct of United States participation in negotiations with foreign governments and international bodies. In exercising this authority, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall coordinate with other agencies as appropriate, and in particular, shall give full consideration to the authority vested by law or Executive order in the Postal Regulatory Commission, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative in this area;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Before concluding any treaty, convention, or amendment that establishes a rate or classification for a product subject to subchapter I of chapter 36, the Secretary of State shall request the Postal Regulatory Commission to submit its views on whether such rate or classification is consistent with the standards and criteria established by the Commission under section 3622.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall ensure that each treaty, convention, or amendment concluded under subsection (b) is consistent with the views submitted by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (1), except if, or to the extent, the Secretary determines, in writing, that it is not in the foreign policy or national security interest of the United States to ensure consistency with the Commission's views. Such written determination shall be provided to the Commission together with a full explanation of the reasons thereof, provided that the Secretary may designate which portions of the determination or explanation shall be kept confidential for reasons of foreign policy or national security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Nothing in this section shall be considered to prevent the Postal Service from entering into such commercial or operational contracts related to providing international postal services and other international delivery services as it deems appropriate, except that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In exercising the authority under subsection (b) to conclude new postal treaties and conventions related to international postal services and to renegotiate such treaties and conventions, the Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent practicable, take such measures as are within the Secretary's control to encourage the governments of other countries to make available to the Postal Service and private companies a range of nondiscriminatory customs procedures that will fully meet the needs of all types of American shippers. The Secretary of State shall consult with the United States Trade Representative and the Commissioner of Customs in carrying out this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) There are authorized to be appropriated, out of the Postal Service Fund, such sums as may be necessary for the Postal Regulatory Commission. In requesting an appropriation under this subsection for a fiscal year, the Commission shall prepare and submit to the Congress under section 2009 a budget of the Commission's expenses, including expenses for facilities, supplies, compensation, and employee benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The provisions of section 410 and chapter 10 of this title shall apply to the Commission, as appropriate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1004. Supervisory and other managerial organizations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) It shall be the policy of the Postal Service to provide compensation, working conditions, and career opportunities that will assure the attraction and retention of qualified and capable supervisory and other managerial personnel; to provide adequate and reasonable differentials in rates of pay between employees in the clerk and carrier grades in the line work force and supervisory and other managerial personnel; to establish and maintain continuously a program for all such personnel that reflects the essential importance of a well-trained and well-motivated force to improve the effectiveness of postal operations; and to promote the leadership status of such personnel with respect to rank-and-file employees, recognizing that the role of such personnel in primary level management is particularly vital to the process of converting general postal policies into successful postal operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Postal Service shall provide a program for consultation with recognized organizations of supervisory and other managerial personnel who are not subject to collective-bargaining agreements under chapter 12 of this title. Upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Postal Service that a supervisory organization represents a majority of supervisors, that an organization (other than an organization representing supervisors) represents at least 20 percent of postmasters, or that a managerial organization (other than an organization representing supervisors or postmasters) represents a substantial percentage of managerial employees, such organization or organizations shall be entitled to participate directly in the planning and development of pay policies and schedules, fringe benefit programs, and other programs relating to supervisory and other managerial employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Postal Service and the supervisors&rsquo; organization shall, unless otherwise mutually agreed to, meet at least once each month to implement the consultation and direct participation procedures of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) At least 7 days before each meeting, each party shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) provide notice of agenda items, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) describe in detail the proposals such party will make with respect to each such item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Grievances of individual employees shall not be matters which may be included as agenda items under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In order to facilitate consultation and direct participation by the supervisors&rsquo; organization in the planning and development of programs under subsection (b) of this section which affect members of the supervisors&rsquo; organization, the Postal Service shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide in writing a description of any proposed program and the reasons for it;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) give the organization at least 60 days (unless extraordinary circumstances require earlier action) to review and make recommendations with respect to the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) give any recommendation from the organization full and fair consideration in deciding whether or how to proceed with the program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Postal Service decides to implement a program described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Postal Service shall before such implementation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) give the supervisors&rsquo; organization details of its decision to implement the program, together with the information upon which the decision is based;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) give the organization an opportunity to make recommendations with respect to the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) give such recommendations full and fair consideration, including the providing of reasons to the organization if any of such recommendations are rejected.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a program described in paragraph (1) of this subsection is implemented, the Postal Service shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) develop a method for the supervisors&rsquo; organization to participate in further planning and development of the program, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) give the organization adequate access to information to make that participation productive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Postal Service and the supervisors&rsquo; organization may, by agreement, adopt procedures different from those provided by this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Postal Service shall, within 45 days of each date on which an agreement is reached on a collective bargaining agreement between the Postal Service and the bargaining representative recognized under section 1203 of this title which represents the largest number of employees, make a proposal for any changes in pay policies and schedules and fringe benefit programs for members of the supervisors&rsquo; organization which are to be in effect during the same period as covered by such agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Postal Service and the supervisors&rsquo; organization shall strive to resolve any differences concerning the proposal described in paragraph (1) of this subsection under the procedures provided for, or adopted under, subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Postal Service shall provide its decision concerning changes proposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection to the supervisors&rsquo; organization within 90 days following the submission of the proposal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) If, notwithstanding the mutual efforts required by subsection (e) of this section, the supervisors&rsquo; organization believes that the decision of the Postal Service is not in accordance with the provisions of this title, the organization may, within 10 days following its receipt of such decision, request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to convene a factfinding panel (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;panel&rdquo;) concerning such matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 15 days after receiving a request under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall provide a list of 7 individuals recognized as experts in supervisory and managerial pay policies. Each party shall designate one individual <!-- PDFPage:37 -->from the list to serve on the panel. If, within 10 days after the list is provided, either of the parties has not designated an individual from the list, the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall make the designation. The first two individuals designated from the list shall meet within 5 days and shall designate a third individual from the list. The third individual shall chair the panel. If the two individuals designated from the list are unable to designate a third individual within 5 days after their first meeting, the Director shall designate the third individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The panel shall recommend standards for pay policies and schedules and fringe benefit programs affecting the members of the supervisors&rsquo; organization for the period covered by the collective bargaining agreement specified in subsection (e)(1) of this section. The standards shall be consistent with the policies of this title, including sections 1003(a) and 1004(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The panel shall, consistent with such standards, make appropriate recommendations concerning the differences between the parties on such policies, schedules, and programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The panel shall make its recommendation no more than 30 days after its appointment, unless the Postal Service and the supervisors&rsquo; organization agree to a longer period. The panel shall hear from the Postal Service and the supervisors&rsquo; organization in such a manner as it shall direct. The cost of the panel shall be borne equally by the Postal Service and the supervisors&rsquo; organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Not more than 15 days after the panel has made its recommendation, the Postal Service shall provide the supervisors&rsquo; organization its final decision on the matters covered by factfinding under this subsection. The Postal Service shall give full and fair consideration to the panel's recommendation and shall explain in writing any differences between its final decision and the panel's recommendation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Not earlier than 3 years after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and from time to time thereafter, the Postal Service or the supervisors&rsquo; organization may request, by written notice to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and to the other party, the creation of a panel to review the effectiveness of the procedures and the other provisions of this section and the provisions of section 1003 of this title. The panel shall be designated in accordance with the procedure established in subsection (f)(2) of this section. The panel shall make recommendations to the Congress for changes in this title as it finds appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) In order to ensure that postmasters and postmasters&rsquo; organizations are afforded the same rights under this section as are afforded to supervisors and the supervisors&rsquo; organization, subsections (c) through (g) shall be applied with respect to postmasters and postmasters&rsquo; organizations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by substituting &ldquo;postmasters&rsquo; organization&rdquo; for &ldquo;supervisors&rsquo; organization&rdquo; each place it appears; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if 2 or more postmasters&rsquo; organizations exist, by treating such organizations as if they constituted a single organization, in accordance with such arrangements as such organizations shall mutually agree to.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If 2 or more postmasters&rsquo; organizations exist, such organizations shall, in the case of any factfinding panel convened at the request of such organizations (in accordance with paragraph (1)(B)), be jointly and severally liable for the cost of such panel, apart from the portion to be borne by the Postal Service (as determined under subsection (f)(4)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) With the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Postal Service may deposit moneys of the Fund in any Federal Reserve bank, any depository for public funds, or in such other places and in such manner as the Postal Service and the Secretary may mutually agree.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The maximum amount allowable under this paragraph is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Postal Service may pledge the assets of the Postal Service and pledge and use its revenues and receipts for the payment of the principal of or interest on obligations issued by the Postal Service under this section, for the purchase or redemption thereof, and for other purposes incidental thereto, including creation of reserve, sinking, and other funds which may be similarly pledged and used, to such extent and in such manner as it deems necessary or desirable.

Each such committee shall take such action as it considers appropriate and shall advise the Postal Service of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The failure of the President to request the appropriation of any part of the funds authorized by this section may not be deemed a failure of appropriations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The rates established under chapter 36 of this title for zone-rated parcels formerly entered under former chapter 67 of this title shall not be more than 10 percent less than the rates for such mail would be if the funds authorized under subsection (b) were not appropriated.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever the Postal Service believes that any person is mailing or causing to be mailed any sexually oriented advertisement in violation of section 3010 of this title, it may request the Attorney General to commence a civil action against such person in a district court of the United States. Upon a finding by the court of a violation of that section, the court may issue an order including one or more of the following provisions as the court deems just under the circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a direction to the defendant to refrain from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to a specific addressee, to any group of addressees, or to all persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a direction to any postmaster to whom sexually oriented advertisements originating with such defendant are tendered for transmission through the mails to refuse to accept such advertisements for mailing; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a direction to any postmaster at the office at which registered or certified letters or other letters or mail arrive, addressed to the defendant or his representative, to return the registered or certified letters or other letters or mail to the sender appropriately marked as being in response to mail in violation of section 3010 of this title, after the defendant, or his representative, has been notified and given reasonable opportunity to examine such letters or mail and to obtain delivery of mail which is clearly not connected with activity <!-- PDFPage:69 -->alleged to be in violation of section 3010 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The statement that remittances may be made to a person named in a sexually oriented advertisement is prima facie evidence that such named person is the principal, agent, or representative of the mailer for the receipt of remittances on his behalf. The court is not precluded from ascertaining the existence of the agency on the basis of any other evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In preparation for, or during the pendency of, a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, a district court of the United States, upon application therefor by the Attorney General and upon a showing of probable cause to believe the statute is being violated, may enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction containing such terms as the court deems just, including, but not limited to, provisions enjoining the defendant from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to any person or class of persons, directing any postmaster to refuse to accept such defendant's sexually oriented advertisements for mailing, and directing the detention of the defendant's incoming mail by any postmaster pending the conclusion of the judicial proceedings. Any action taken by a court under this subsection does not affect or determine any fact at issue in any other proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A civil action under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in any judicial district in which any sexually oriented advertisement mailed in violation of section 3010 has been delivered by mail according to the direction thereon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Nothing in this section or in section 3010 shall be construed as amending, preempting, limiting, modifying, or otherwise in any way affecting section 1461 or 1463 of title 18 or section 3007 or 3008 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3622. Modern rate regulation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority Generally</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, by regulation establish (and may from time to time thereafter by regulation revise) a modern system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Objectives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Such system shall be designed to achieve the following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction with the others:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To maximize incentives to reduce costs and increase efficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To create predictability and stability in rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To maintain high quality service standards established under section 3691.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To allow the Postal Service pricing flexibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To assure adequate revenues, including retained earnings, to maintain financial stability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To reduce the administrative burden and increase the transparency of the ratemaking process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To enhance mail security and deter terrorism.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To establish and maintain a just and reasonable schedule for rates and classifications, however the objective under this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the Postal Service from making changes of unequal magnitude within, between, or among classes of mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To allocate the total institutional costs of the Postal Service appropriately between market-dominant and competitive products.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In establishing or revising such system, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the value of the mail service actually provided each class or type of mail service to both the sender and the recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of transportation, and priority of delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to each class or type of mail service through reliably identified causal relationships plus that portion of all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to such class or type;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the effect of rate increases upon the general public, business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than letters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) simplicity of structure for the entire schedule and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees charged the various classes of mail for postal services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the importance of pricing flexibility to encourage increased mail volume and operational efficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the relative value to the people of the kinds of mail matter entered into the postal system and the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the importance of providing classifications with extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and of providing those that do not require high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the desirability of special classifications for both postal users and the Postal Service in accordance with the policies of this title, including agreements between the Postal Service and postal users, when available on public and reasonable terms to similarly situated mailers, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) improve the net financial position of the Postal Service through reducing Postal Service costs or increasing the overall contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) enhance the performance of mail preparation, processing, transportation, or other functions; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not cause unreasonable harm to the marketplace.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the need for the Postal Service to increase its efficiency and reduce its costs, including infrastructure costs, to help maintain high quality, affordable postal services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the value to the Postal Service and postal users of promoting intelligent mail and of secure, sender-identified mail; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the policies of this title as well as such other factors as the Commission determines appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:92 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include an annual limitation on the percentage changes in rates to be set by the Postal Regulatory Commission that will be equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers unadjusted for seasonal variation over the most recent available 12-month period preceding the date the Postal Service files notice of its intention to increase rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish a schedule whereby rates, when necessary and appropriate, would change at regular intervals by predictable amounts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not later than 45 days before the implementation of any adjustment in rates under this section, including adjustments made under subsection (c)(10)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) require the Postal Service to provide public notice of the adjustment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide an opportunity for review by the Postal Regulatory Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provide for the Postal Regulatory Commission to notify the Postal Service of any noncompliance of the adjustment with the limitation under subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) require the Postal Service to respond to the notice provided under clause (iii) and describe the actions to be taken to comply with the limitation under subparagraph (A);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) establish procedures whereby the Postal Service may adjust rates not in excess of the annual limitations under subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) notwithstanding any limitation set under subparagraphs (A) and (C), and provided there is not sufficient unused rate authority under paragraph (2)(C), establish procedures whereby rates may be adjusted on an expedited basis due to either extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, provided that the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing and comment, and within 90 days after any request by the Postal Service, that such adjustment is reasonable and equitable and necessary to enable the Postal Service, under best practices of honest, efficient, and economical management, to maintain and continue the development of postal services of the kind and quality adapted to the needs of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Classes of mail</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided under subparagraph (C), the annual limitations under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply to a class of mail, as defined in the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule as in effect on the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Rounding of rates and fees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Postal Service from rounding rates and fees to the nearest whole integer, if the effect of such rounding does not cause the overall rate increase for any class to exceed the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Use of unused rate authority.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;unused rate adjustment authority&rdquo; means the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the maximum amount of a rate adjustment that the Postal Service is authorized to make in any year subject to the annual limitation under paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the amount of the rate adjustment the Postal Service actually makes in that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to clause (iii), the Postal Service may use any unused rate adjustment authority for any of the 5 years following the year such authority occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Limitations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In exercising the authority under clause (ii) in any year, the Postal Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) may use unused rate adjustment authority from more than 1 year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) may use any part of the unused rate adjustment authority from any year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) shall use the unused rate adjustment authority from the earliest year such authority first occurred and then each following year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) for any class or service, may not exceed the annual limitation under paragraph (1) by more than 2 percentage points.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Ten years after the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act and as appropriate thereafter, the Commission shall review the system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products established under this section to determine if the system is achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c). If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that the system is not achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c), the Commission may, by regulation, make such modification or adopt such alternative system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products as necessary to achieve the objectives.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Workshare Discounts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this subsection, the term &ldquo;workshare discount&rdquo; refers to rate discounts provided to mailers for the presorting, prebarcoding, handling, or transportation of mail, as further defined by the Postal Regulatory Commission under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Scope</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure that such discounts do not exceed the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of workshare activity, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the discount is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) associated with a new postal service, a change to an existing postal service, or with a new work share initiative related to an existing postal service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) necessary to induce mailer behavior that furthers the economically efficient operation of the Postal Service and the <!-- PDFPage:93 -->portion of the discount in excess of the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of the workshare activity will be phased out over a limited period of time;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the discount above costs avoided&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is necessary to mitigate rate shock; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) will be phased out over time;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Provisions waived</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A product shall not, while it is being tested under this section, be subject to the requirements of sections 3622, 3633, or 3642, or regulations promulgated under those sections.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Conditions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A product may not be tested under this section unless it satisfies each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Significantly different product</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The product is, from the viewpoint of the mail users, significantly different from all products offered by the Postal Service within the 2-year period preceding the start of the test.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Market disruption</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The introduction or continued offering of the product will not create an unfair or otherwise inappropriate competitive advantage for the Postal Service or any mailer, particularly in regard to small business concerns (as defined under subsection (h)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Correct categorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Service identifies the product, for the purpose of a test under this section, as either market-dominant or competitive, consistent with the criteria under section 3642(b)(1). Costs and revenues attributable to a product identified as competitive shall be included in any determination under section 3633(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3641_1_target" name="3641_1">1</a></sup> (relating to provisions applicable to competitive products collectively).

Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be considered to permit or require the publication of any information as to which confidential treatment is accorded under the preceding sentence (subject to the same exception as set forth in section 504(g)(3)).</p>

In carrying out the preceding sentence, the Postal Regulatory Commission may limit the amount of revenues the Postal Service may obtain from any particular geographic market as necessary to prevent market disruption (as defined under subsection (b)(2)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exemption authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission may, upon written applica<!-- PDFPage:101 -->tion of the Postal Service, exempt the market test from the limit in paragraph (1) if the total revenues that are anticipated, or in fact received, by the Postal Service from such product do not exceed $50,000,000 in any year, subject to subsection (g). In reviewing an application under this paragraph, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall approve such application if it determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the product is likely to benefit the public and meet an expected demand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the product is likely to contribute to the financial stability of the Postal Service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the product is not likely to result in unfair or otherwise inappropriate competition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Postal Regulatory Commission at any time determines that a market test under this section fails, with respect to any particular product, to meet 1 or more of the requirements of this section, it may order the cancellation of the test involved or take such other action as it considers appropriate. A determination under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such procedures as the Commission shall by regulation prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Adjustment for Inflation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of each year following the year in which occurs the deadline for the Postal Service's first report to the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3652(a), each dollar amount contained in this section shall be adjusted by the change in the Consumer Price Index for such year (as determined under regulations of the Commission).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Definition of a Small Business Concern</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The criteria used in defining small business concerns or otherwise categorizing business concerns as small business concerns shall, for purposes of this section, be established by the Postal Regulatory Commission in conformance with the requirements of section 3 of the Small Business Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Effective Date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Market tests under this subchapter may be conducted in any year beginning with the first year in which occurs the deadline for the Postal Service's first report to the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3652(a).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The market-dominant category of products shall consist of each product in the sale of which the Postal Service exercises sufficient market power that it can effectively set the price of such product substantially above costs, raise prices significantly, decrease quality, or decrease output, without risk of losing a significant level of business to other firms offering similar products. The competitive category of products shall consist of all other products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of products covered by postal monopoly</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A product covered by the postal monopoly shall not be subject to transfer under this section from the market-dominant category of mail. For purposes of the preced<!-- PDFPage:102 -->ing sentence, the term &ldquo;product covered by the postal monopoly&rdquo; means any product the conveyance or transmission of which is reserved to the United States under section 1696 of title 18, subject to the same exception as set forth in the last sentence of section 409(e)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Additional considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In making any decision under this section, due regard shall be given to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the availability and nature of enterprises in the private sector engaged in the delivery of the product involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the views of those who use the product involved on the appropriateness of the proposed action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the likely impact of the proposed action on small business concerns (within the meaning of section 3641(h)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Transfers of Subclasses and Other Subordinate Units Allowable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this title shall be considered to prevent transfers under this section from being made by reason of the fact that they would involve only some (but not all) of the subclasses or other subordinate units of the class of mail or type of postal service involved (without regard to satisfaction of minimum quantity requirements standing alone).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Notification and Publication Requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Notification requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Service shall, whenever it requests to add a product or transfer a product to a different category, file with the Postal Regulatory Commission and publish in the Federal Register a notice setting out the basis for its determination that the product satisfies the criteria under subsection (b) and, in the case of a request to add a product or transfer a product to the competitive category of mail, that the product meets the regulations promulgated by the Postal Regulatory Commission under section 3633. The provisions of section 504(g) shall be available with respect to any information required to be filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Publication requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, whenever it changes the list of products in the market-dominant or competitive category of mail, prescribe new lists of products. The revised lists shall indicate how and when any previous lists (including the lists under sections 3621 and 3631) are superseded, and shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in section 3641, no product that involves the physical delivery of letters, printed matter, or packages may be offered by the Postal Service unless it has been assigned to the market-dominant or competitive category of mail (as appropriate) either&mdash;</p>

If the Secretary suspends or revokes an operating certificate, the Secretary shall notify the Postal Service. Upon such notification, the Postal Service shall cease tender of mail to such carrier until the Secretary certifies the carrier is operating in a safe manner. Upon such receipt, the carrier shall demonstrate that it otherwise meets the minimum carriage requirements of this section before being tendered mail under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(r) The Postal Service shall have the authority to tender nonpriority bypass mail to any carrier that meets the requirements of subsection (g)(1) on any city pair route in the State of Alaska on an emergency basis. Such emergency tender shall cease when a carrier qualifies for tender on such route under the terms of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(s) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except for written contracts authorized under subsections (b), (c) and (d), tender by the Postal Service of any category of mail to a carrier for transportation between any two points in the State of Alaska shall not give rise to any contract between the Postal Service and a carrier, nor shall any such carrier acquire any right in continued or future tender of such mail by virtue of past or present receipt of such mail.

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;206, title III, &sect;3002(b), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 910, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The State of Alaska is the largest State in the Union and has a very limited system of roads connecting communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Alaska has more pilots per capita than any other State in the Union.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Pilots flying in Alaska are often the most skilled and best-prepared pilots in the world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Air travel within the State of Alaska is often hampered by severe weather conditions and treacherous terrain.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The United States Government owns nearly 2/3 of Alaska's landmass, including large tracts of land separating isolated communities within the State.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Such Federal ownership has inhibited the ability of Alaskans to build roads connecting isolated communities.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:122 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Most communities and a large portion of the population within the State can only be reached by air.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The vast majority of food items and everyday necessities destined for these isolated communities and populations can only be transported through the air.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system, created by Congress and operated by the United States Postal Service under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code, with input from the Department of Transportation, connecting hundreds of rural and isolated communities within the State, is a critical piece of the Alaska and the national transportation system. The system is like a 4-legged stool, designed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) provide the most affordable means of delivering food and everyday necessities to these rural and isolated communities;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) establish a system whereby the Postal Service can meet its obligations to deliver mail to every house and business in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) support affordable and reliable passenger service; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) support affordable and reliable nonmail freight service.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Without the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) it would be difficult and more expensive for the Postal Service to meet its obligation of delivering mail to every house and business in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) food, medicine, freight, and everyday necessities and passenger service for these rural and isolated communities would cost several times the current level.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Attempts by Congress to support passenger and nonmail freight service in Alaska using the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system have yielded some positive results, but some carriers have been manipulating the system by carrying few, if any, passengers and little nonmail freight while earning most of their revenues from the carriage of nonpriority bypass mail.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) As long as the Federal Government continues to own large tracts of land within the State of Alaska which impede access to isolated communities, it is in the best interest of the Postal Service, the residents of Alaska and the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system remains strong, viable, and affordable for the Postal Service;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe passenger service;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe nonmail freight service;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) to encourage that intra-Alaska air carriers move toward safer, more secure, and more reliable air transportation under the Federal Aviation Administration's guidelines and in accordance with part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, where such operations are supported by the needs of the community; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) that Congress, pursuant to the authority granted under Article I, section 8 of the United States Constitution to establish Post Offices and post roads, make changes to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system continues to be used to support substantial passenger and nonmail freight service and to reduce costs for the Postal Service.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;206, title III, &sect;3002(d), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 923, provided that: &ldquo;Beginning 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 2, 2002], if the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary's findings and recommendations of the Postal Service, that an air carrier being tendered nonpriority bush bypass mail is not taking actions to attempt to qualify as a bush passenger or nonmail freight carrier under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code (as amended by this title), the Postal Service shall immediately cease tender of all nonpriority bypass mail to such carrier.&rdquo;</p>
