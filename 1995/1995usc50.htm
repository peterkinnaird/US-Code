<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that the natural resources of the United States in certain strategic <!-- PDFPage:12 -->and critical materials are deficient or insufficiently developed to supply the military, industrial, and essential civilian needs of the United States for national defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the acquisition and retention of stocks of certain strategic and critical materials and to encourage the conservation and development of sources of such materials within the United States and thereby to decrease and to preclude, when possible, a dangerous and costly dependence by the United States upon foreign sources for supplies of such materials in times of national emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In providing for the National Defense Stockpile under this subchapter, Congress establishes the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The purpose of the National Defense Stockpile is to serve the interest of national defense only. The National Defense Stockpile is not to be used for economic or budgetary purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Before October 1, 1994, the quantities of materials stockpiled under this subchapter should be sufficient to sustain the United States for a period of not less than three years during a national emergency situation that would necessitate total mobilization of the economy of the United States for a sustained conventional global war of indefinite duration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) On and after October 1, 1994, the quantities of materials stockpiled under this subchapter should be sufficient to meet the needs of the United States during a period of a national emergency that would necessitate an expansion of the Armed Forces together with a significant mobilization of the economy of the United States under planning guidance issued by the Secretary of Defense.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President determines that the defense, security, and general welfare of the United States requires such action, the Secretary shall issue such regulations as he deems necessary for the licensing of sales and transportation of helium in interstate commerce after extraction from helium-bearing natural gas or helium-gas mixtures. Thereafter it shall be unlawful for any person to sell or transfer helium in interstate commerce except in accordance with such regulations or pursuant to the terms of a license issued by the Secretary, or in accordance with the terms of a contract or agreement with the Secretary entered into pursuant to this chapter. For the purpose of this section, the term &ldquo;helium&rdquo; shall mean helium, after extraction from helium-bearing natural gas or helium-gas mixtures, in a refined or semirefined state suitable for use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms; assignments; revocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each license shall be issued for a specified period to be determined by the Secretary, but not exceeding five years, and may be renewed by the Secretary upon the expiration of such period. No such license shall be issued to a person if in the opinion of the Secretary the issuance of a license to such person would be inimical to the defense and security of the United States. No such license shall be assigned or otherwise transferred directly or indirectly except with the consent or approval of the Secretary in writing. Any such license may be revoked for any material false statement in the application for license, or for violation or a failure to comply with the terms and provisions of this chapter, the regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant thereto or the terms of the license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In issuing licenses under this section, the Secretary shall impose such regulations and terms of licenses as will permit him effectively to promote the common defense and security as well as the general welfare of the United States. The licensing authority herein granted shall be used solely for the purpose of preventing the transportation or sale of helium for end uses determined by the Secretary to be nonessential or wasteful, and any determination that any end use is nonessential or wasteful shall be published in the form of general regulations applicable to all transportation or sales of helium.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Suspension; reacquisition of supplies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever Congress or the President declares that a war or national emergency exists, the Secretary is authorized to suspend any license granted under this chapter if in his judgment such suspension is necessary to the defense and security of the United States, and he is further authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to recapture or reacquire supplies of helium.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Documentation of vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any vessel not documented under the laws of the United States, acquired by or made available to the Secretary of Transportation under sections 196 to 198 of this title, or otherwise, may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the discretion of the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating be documented as a vessel of the United States under such rules and regulations or orders, and with such limitations, as the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may prescribe or issue as necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and provisions of sections 196 to 198 of this title, and in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, engage in the coastwise trade when so documented. Any document issued to a vessel under the provisions of this subsection shall be surrendered at any time that such surrender may be ordered by the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. No vessel, the surrender of the documents of which has been so ordered, shall, after the effective date of such order, have the status of a vessel of the United States unless documented anew.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Waiver of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, by rules and regulations or orders, waive compliance with any provision of law relating to masters, officers, members of the crew, or crew accommodations on any vessel documented under authority of this section to such extent and upon such terms as he finds necessary because of the lack of physical facilities on such vessels, and because of the need to employ aliens for their operation. No vessel shall cease to enjoy the benefits and privileges of a vessel of the United States by reason of the employment of any person in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Coastwise trade; inspection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any vessel while documented under the provisions of this section, when chartered under sections 196 to 198 of this title by the Secretary of Transportation to Government agencies or departments or to private operators, may engage in the coastwise trade under permits issued by <!-- PDFPage:41 -->the Secretary of Transportation, who is authorized to issue permits for such purpose pursuant to such rules and regulations as he may prescribe. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and provisions of this section. The second paragraph of section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended [46 App. U.S.C. 808], shall not apply with respect to vessels chartered to Government agencies or departments or to private operators or otherwise used or disposed of under sections 196 to 198 of this title. Existing laws covering the inspection of steam vessels are made applicable to vessels documented under this section only to such extent and upon such conditions as may be required by regulations of the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating: <em>Provided</em>, That in determining to what extent those laws should be made applicable, due consideration shall be given to the primary purpose of transporting commodities essential to the national defense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reconditioning of vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation without regard to the provisions of section 5 of title 41 may repair, reconstruct, or recondition any vessels to be utilized under sections 196 to 198 of this title. The Secretary of Transportation and any other Government department or agency by which any vessel is acquired or chartered, or to which any vessel is transferred or made available under sections 196 to 198 of this title may, with the aid of any funds available and without regard to the provisions of said section 5 of title 41, repair, reconstruct, or recondition any such vessels to meet the needs of the services intended, or provide facilities for such repair, reconstruction, or reconditioning. The Secretary of Transportation may operate or charter for operation any vessel to be utilized under sections 196 to 198 of this title to private operators, citizens of the United States, or to any department or agency of the United States Government, without regard to the provisions of title VII of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 [46 App. U.S.C. 1191 et seq.], and any department or agency of the United States Government is authorized to enter into such charters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effective period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of any voyage of a vessel documented under the provisions of this section begun before the date of termination of an effective period of section 196 of this title, but is completed after such date, the provisions of this section shall continue in effect with respect to such vessel until such voyage is completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Documented&rdquo; defined</h4>

An employee who receives separation pay under this section on the basis of a separation occurring on or after the date of the enactment of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 [Mar. 30, 1994] and accepts employment with the Government of the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which payment of the separation pay is based shall be required to repay the entire amount of the separation pay to the Central Intelligence Agency. If the employment is with an Executive agency (as defined by section 105 of title 5, United States Code), the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may, at the request of the head of the agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is with an entity in the legislative branch, the head of the entity or the appointing official may waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is with the judicial branch, the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">NATIONAL SECURITY RESOURCES BOARD</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">Section 1. Functions of Chairman and of Board</h4>
<p class="note-body">The functions of the National Security Resources Board are hereby transferred to the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board, and the Board shall hereafter advise and consult with the Chairman with respect to such matters within his jurisdiction as he may request.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 2. Vice Chairman</h4>
<p class="note-body">There is hereby established the office of Vice Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. Such Vice Chairman shall (1) be an additional member of the National Security Resources Board, (2) be appointed from civilian life by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, (3) receive compensation at the rate of $16,000 per annum, and (4) perform such of the duties of the Chairman as the Chairman shall designate.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 3. Performance of Functions of Chairman</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Chairman may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, or by any agency or employee, of the National Security Resources Board of any function of the Chairman.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers the function of the National Security Resources Board from the Board to the Chairman of the Board and makes the Board advisory to the Chairman. The plan also provides for a Vice Chairman, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The function assigned to the National Security Resources Board by the National Security Act of 1947 is &ldquo;to advise the President concerning the coordination of military, industrial and civilian mobilization.&rdquo; Proper performance of this function requires action by the Board and its staff in two broad areas:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The conduct of advance mobilization planning which identifies the problems which will arise and the measures necessary to meet these problems if and when the Nation moves from a peacetime into a wartime situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The formulation of current policies and programs which will help the Nation achieve an adequate state of readiness against the eventuality of a future war.</p>
<p class="note-body">The role assigned the National Security Resources Board is clearly one of staff assistance to the President. The Congress recently recognized this fact in its approval of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1949 which, pursuant to the specific recommendation of the Hoover Commission, placed the National Security Resources Board in the Executive Office of the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The accompanying reorganization plan is designed to make the National Security Resources Board a more effective instrument. Successful performance of the Board's mission requires a wide range of detailed study and analysis to cover all the major aspects of national mobilization. A committee of department heads or departmental representatives encounters some natural difficulties in providing supervision and leadership in <!-- PDFPage:97 -->such an extensive and detailed activity. The Chairman has the difficult task of exercising discretion as to which matters shall be submitted for Board approval. The departmental members of the Board cannot possibly supervise or approve the Board's extensive and detailed activities and yet, as Board members, must accept ultimate responsibility for all such activities. Likewise, the departmental members are encumbered by the difficulty of having to reach collective and speedy decisions on a great many matters for which they, as Board members, are responsible.</p>
<p class="note-body">By vesting the functions of the Board in the Chairman, the difficulties of Board operation will be overcome. At the same time, the reorganization plan provides for the continued participation of the several departments and agencies in the task of mobilization planning. This is not only a matter of established policy but also a requirement of the National Security Act. The departments will continue to have representation on the Board. The Board, in an advisory relationship to the Chairman, will be a useful arrangement for obtaining the necessary participation of departments in mobilization planning and for coordination of their activity. It will enable the departments to keep abreast of the total range of security resources planning. Without reliance on the departments for the execution of much of the actual job of mobilization planning, coordination with the total range of governmental policies and objectives would be lost.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Congress in passing the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 recognized the difficulty which exists when functions of staff advice and assistance are placed in a board-type agency. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949, in clarifying the role of the Chairman of the Munitions Board and the Research and Development Board, strengthened and increased the effectiveness of these staff agencies of the Secretary of Defense by providing for the exclusive exercise of responsibilities by the Chairman. This plan achieves the same objective for the National Security Resources Board.</p>
<p class="note-body">The accompanying reorganization plan provides for a Vice Chairman appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The tremendous responsibilities of the National Security Resources Board and the heavy workload on the Chairman fully warrant this. Providing the Chairman with a principal associate for the exercise of his responsibilities is consistent with the usual practice in other agencies of the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Vice Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. The rate of compensation fixed for this officer is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 25 may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, the important objective is maximum effectiveness in security resources planning.</p>
<p class="note-body">The security of this Nation requires that these steps be taken to enable security resources planning to move forward more effectively. It is for that reason that Reorganization Plan No. 25 is today submitted to the Congress. It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I strongly urge congressional acceptance of Reorganization Plan No. 25.</p>

<p class="note-body">[For subsequent history relating to Office of Defense Mobilization, see notes set out under this section.]</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan is designed to achieve two primary objectives: The first is to improve the organization of the Executive Office of the President; the second is to enable one Executive Office agency to exercise strong leadership in our national mobilization effort, including both current defense activities and readiness for any future national emergency.</p>
<p class="note-body">The National Security Resources Board was established by the National Security Act of 1947 to advise the President concerning various aspects of future military, industrial, and civilian mobilization. The areas of responsibility assigned to the Board included the use of national and industrial resources for military and civilian needs; the sufficiency of productive facilities; the strategic relocation of industries; the mobilization and maximum utilization of manpower; and the maintenance and stabilization of the civilian economy.</p>
<p class="note-body">The vigorous and efficient discharge of these vital functions is not well served by the simultaneous existence in the Executive Office of the President of the National Security Resources Board (charged with planning for the future) and the present Office of Defense Mobilization (charged with programs of the present). The progress of the current mobilization effort has made plain how artificial is the present separation of these functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both functions should now be combined into one defense mobilization agency. Accordingly, the reorganization plan would create in the Executive Office of the President a new agency, to be known as the Office of Defense Mobilization. It would transfer to the new Office the functions of the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board and abolish that Board, including the offices of Chairman and Vice Chairman.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan also transfers to the new agency the statutory functions of the present Office of Defense Mobilization. These are of a minor nature, the major functions of the present Office of Defense Mobilization having been delegated to it by the President, principally under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. It is my intention to transfer the latter functions to the new agency by Executive order, and to abolish the Office of Defense Mobilization established by Executive Order No. 10193. There will thus result a new agency which combines the activities of the National Security Resources Board and both the statutory and delegated functions of the heretofore existing Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed plan would also reorganize various activities relating to the stockpiling of strategic and critical materials. Those activities are principally provided for in the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended. It has become increasingly apparent that the policy and program aspects of stockpiling are an integral part of mobilization planning. They should not be administered separately from plant expansion, conservation of materials, and materials procurement under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or from the duties placed in the National Security Resources Board by the National Security Act of 1947. Therefore, the reorganization plan would transfer to the Director of the new Office of Defense Mobilization responsibility for major stockpiling actions, including the determination of the nature and quantities of materials to be stockpiled. In the main, these functions are transferred from the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force (acting jointly through the agency of the Munitions Board) and the Secretary of the Interior. The duties of the Administrator of General Services regarding the purchase of strategic and critical materials and the management of stockpiles are not affected by the reorganization plan, except that he will receive his directions, under the plan, from the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization instead of from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">This transfer of stockpiling functions will correct the present undesirable confusion of responsibilities. The functions of the heads of the military departments of the Department of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, are at present in considerable measure subject to other authority of delegates of the President springing from the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. The allocation and distribution of scarce materials among essential civilian and military activities and the continued maintenance of adequate stockpiles of strategic and critical materials are of major current importance. The reorganization plan will make possible more effective coordination and close control over the Government's whole stockpile program. It will speed decisions. It can result in significant economies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Defense will, of course, continue to be responsible for presenting the needs of the mili<!-- PDFPage:99 -->tary services. That Department and the Department of the Interior are specifically designated in the plan as additional agencies which shall appoint representatives to cooperate with the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization in determining which materials are strategic and critical and how much of them is to be purchased. Final authority with regard to such determination will, however, be in the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5(a) of the reorganization plan withholds from transfer to the Director and abolishes the functions of the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board with regard to being consulted by and furnishing advice to the President concerning the placing of orders of mandatory precedence for articles or materials for the use of the armed forces of the United States or for the use of the Atomic Energy Commission, and with regard to determining that a plant, mine, or other facility can be readily converted to the production or furnishing of such articles or materials. These abolished functions were vested in the National Security Resources Board by section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (later renamed as the Universal Military Training and Service Act) and were transferred to the Chairman of that Board by Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950. The practical effect of this abolition is to obviate a statutory mandate that the President consult and advise with another officer of the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5(b) of the reorganization plan abolishes the direction, authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense over functions transferred from the Department of Defense by the reorganization plan. The Secretary's functions in this regard are provided for in section 202(b) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (5 U.S.C. 171a(b)) [see 10 U.S.C. 113(b)].</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5(c) of the reorganization plan abolishes any functions which were vested in the Army and Navy Munitions Board or which are vested in the Munitions Board with respect to serving as the agent through which the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Interior jointly act in determining which materials are strategic and critical under the provisions of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, and the quality and quantities of such materials to be stockpiled. These abolished functions are provided for in section 2(a) of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that by reason of these reorganizations it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Director and a Deputy Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers of the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan will permit better organization and management of the Federal programs relating to materials and requirements and will thus help to achieve the maximum degree of mobilization readiness at the least possible cost. It is not practicable, however, to itemize, in advance of actual experience, the reductions of expenditures to be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1953.</p>
<p class="note-body">I urge that the Congress allow the proposed reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish uniform minimum requirements governing the scope and frequency of background investigations and reinvestigations for all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to classified information as part of their official responsibilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide that all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to classified information shall be required as a <!-- PDFPage:112 -->condition of such access to provide to the employing department or agency written consent which permits access by an authorized investigative agency to relevant financial records, other financial information, consumer reports, and travel records, as determined by the President, in accordance with section 436 of this title, during the period of access to classified information and for a period of three years thereafter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that all employees in the executive branch of Government who require access to particularly sensitive classified information, as determined by the President, shall be required, as a condition of maintaining access to such information, to submit to the employing department or agency, during the period of such access, relevant information concerning their financial condition and foreign travel, as determined by the President, as may be necessary to ensure appropriate security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) establish uniform minimum standards to ensure that employees in the executive branch of Government whose access to classified information is being denied or terminated under this subchapter are appropriately advised of the reasons for such denial or termination and are provided an adequate opportunity to respond to all adverse information which forms the basis for such denial or termination before final action by the department or agency concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;236, title IX, Apr. 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 525, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 902. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) During the Cold War an extensive secrecy system developed which limited public access to information and reduced the ability of the public to participate with full knowledge in the process of governmental decisionmaking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1992 alone 6,349,532 documents were classified and approximately three million persons held some form of security clearance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The burden of managing more than 6 million newly classified documents every year has led to tremendous administrative expense, reduced communication within the government and within the scientific community, reduced communication between the government and the people of the United States, and the selective and unauthorized public disclosure of classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) It has been estimated that private businesses spend more than $14 billion each year implementing government mandated regulations for protecting classified information.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:113 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) If a smaller amount of truly sensitive information were classified the information could be held more securely.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In 1970 a Task Force organized by the Defense Science Board and headed by Dr. Frederick Seitz concluded that &lsquo;more might be gained than lost if our Nation were to adopt&mdash;unilaterally, if necessary&mdash;a policy of complete openness in all areas of information&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The procedures for granting security clearances have themselves become an expensive and inefficient part of the secrecy system and should be closely examined.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) A bipartisan study commission specially constituted for the purpose of examining the consequences of the secrecy system will be able to offer comprehensive proposals for reform.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 903. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the purpose of this title to establish for a two-year period a Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to examine the implications of the extensive classification of information and to make recommendations to reduce the volume of information classified and thereby to strengthen the protection of legitimately classified information; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to examine and make recommendations concerning current procedures relating to the granting of security clearances.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 904. COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION.</h4>

Protecting information critical to our Nation's security remains a priority. In recent years, however, dramatic changes have altered, although not eliminated, the national security threats that we confront.

<p class="note-body">(b) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the classification requirements under this order requires continued protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the senior agency official. That official will determine, as an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure.

Such information may be declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession after consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Classified information accessioned into the National Archives and Records Administration (&ldquo;National Archives&rdquo;) as of the effective date of this order shall be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist in accordance with this order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between the Archivist and the relevant agency head.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to declassify classified information contained in records determined to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that records containing classified information be accessioned into the National Archives when necessary to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act [probably means chapters 21 to 31 of Title 44, Public Printing and Documents].

<p class="note-body">(C) circumstances indicate the employee or former employee had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that is known to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of an investigating agency to obtain information pursuant to the Right to Financial Privacy Act [of 1978, 12 U.S.C. 3401 <em>et seq</em>.], the Fair Credit Reporting Act [15 U.S.C. 1681 <em>et seq</em>.] or any other applicable law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 1.3. <em>Financial Disclosure</em>. (a) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the head of each agency that originates, handles, transmits, or possesses classified information shall designate each employee, by position or category where possible, who has a regular need for access to classified information that, in the discretion of the agency head, would reveal:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the identity of covert agents as defined in the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 [<em>et seq</em>.]);</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) An employee may not be granted access, or hold a position designated as requiring access, to information described in subsection (a) unless, as a condition of access to such information, the employee:</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 2&mdash;ACCESS ELIGIBILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.1. <em>Eligibility Determinations</em>. (a) Determinations of eligibility for access to classified information shall be based on criteria established under this order. Such determinations are separate from suitability determinations with respect to the hiring or retention of persons for employment by the government or any other personnel actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The number of employees that each agency determines are eligible for access to classified information shall be kept to the minimum required for the conduct of agency functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Eligibility for access to classified information shall not be requested or granted solely to permit entry to, or ease of movement within, controlled areas when the employee has no need for access and access to classified information may reasonably be prevented. Where circumstances indicate employees may be inadvertently exposed to classified information in the course of their duties, agencies are authorized to grant or deny, in their discretion, facility access approvals to such employees based on an appropriate level of investigation as determined by each agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Except in agencies where eligibility for access is a mandatory condition of employment, eligibility for access to classified information shall only be requested or granted based on a demonstrated, foreseeable need for access. Requesting or approving eligibility in excess of actual requirements is prohibited.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Eligibility for access to classified information may be granted where there is a temporary need for access, such as one-time participation in a classified project, provided the investigative standards established under this order have been satisfied. In such cases, a fixed date or event for expiration shall be identified and access to classified information shall be limited to information related to the particular project or assignment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Access to classified information shall be terminated when an employee no longer has a need for access.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.2. <em>Level of Access Approval</em>. (a) The level at which an access approval is granted for an employee shall be limited, and relate directly, to the level of classified information for which there is a need for ac<!-- PDFPage:133 -->cess. Eligibility for access to a higher level of classified information includes eligibility for access to information classified at a lower level.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Access to classified information relating to a special access program shall be granted in accordance with procedures established by the head of the agency that created the program or, for programs pertaining to intelligence activities (including special activities but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs) or intelligence sources and methods, by the Director of Central Intelligence. To the extent possible and consistent with the national security interests of the United States, such procedures shall be consistent with the standards and procedures established by and under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.3. <em>Temporary Access to Higher Levels</em>. (a) An employee who has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information based on favorable adjudication of a completed investigation may be granted temporary access to a higher level where security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations find that such access:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) is necessary to meet operational or contractual exigencies not expected to be of a recurring nature;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) will not exceed 180 days; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) is limited to specific, identifiable information that is made the subject of a written access record.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Where the access granted under subsection (a) of this section involves another agency's classified information, that agency must concur before access to its information is granted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.4. <em>Reciprocal Acceptance of Access Eligibility Determinations</em>. (a) Except when an agency has substantial information indicating that an employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, background investigations and eligibility determinations conducted under this order shall be mutually and reciprocally accepted by all agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except where there is substantial information indicating that the employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, an employee with existing access to a special access program shall not be denied eligibility for access to another special access program at the same sensitivity level as determined personally by the agency head or deputy agency head, or have an existing access eligibility readjudicated, so long as the employee has a need for access to the information involved.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This section shall not preclude agency heads from establishing additional, but not duplicative, investigative or adjudicative procedures for a special access program or for candidates for detail or assignment to their agencies, where such procedures are required in exceptional circumstances to protect the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Where temporary eligibility for access is granted under sections 2.3 or 3.3 of this order or where the determination of eligibility for access is conditional, the fact of such temporary or conditional access shall be conveyed to any other agency that considers affording the employee access to its information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.5. <em>Specific Access Requirement</em>. (a) Employees who have been determined to be eligible for access to classified information shall be given access to classified information only where there is a need-to-know that information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is the responsibility of employees who are authorized holders of classified information to verify that a prospective recipient's eligibility for access has been granted by an authorized agency official and to ensure that a need-to-know exists prior to allowing such access, and to challenge requests for access that do not appear well-founded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2.6. <em>Access by Non-United States Citizens</em>. (a) Where there are compelling reasons in furtherance of an agency mission, immigrant alien and foreign national employees who possess a special expertise may, in the discretion of the agency, be granted limited access to classified information only for specific programs, projects, contracts, licenses, certificates, or grants for which there is a need for access. Such individuals shall not be eligible for access to any greater level of classified information than the United States Government has determined may be releasable to the country of which the subject is currently a citizen, and such limited access may be approved only if the prior 10 years of the subject's life can be appropriately investigated. If there are any doubts concerning granting access, additional lawful investigative procedures shall be fully pursued.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Exceptions to these requirements may be permitted only by the agency head or the senior agency official designated under section 6.1 of this order to further substantial national security interests.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 3&mdash;ACCESS ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.1. <em>Standards</em>. (a) No employee shall be deemed to be eligible for access to classified information merely by reason of Federal service or contracting, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee status, or as a matter of right or privilege, or as a result of any particular title, rank, position, or affiliation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Except as provided in sections 2.6 and 3.3 of this order, eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only to employees who are United States citizens for whom an appropriate investigation has been completed and whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information. A determination of eligibility for access to such information is a discretionary security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel. Eligibility shall be granted only where facts and circumstances indicate access to classified information is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) In determining eligibility for access under this order, agencies may investigate and consider any matter that relates to the determination of whether access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. No inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) No negative inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. Such counseling can be a positive factor in eligibility determinations. However, mental health counseling, where relevant to the adjudication of access to classified information, may justify further inquiry to determine whether the standards of subsection (b) of this section are satisfied, and mental health may be considered where it directly relates to those standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, including access to special access programs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.2. <em>Basis for Eligibility Approval</em>. (a) Eligibility determinations for access to classified information shall be based on information concerning the applicant or employee that is acquired through the investigation conducted pursuant to this order or otherwise available to security officials and shall be made part of the applicant's or employee's security record. Applicants or employees shall be required to provide relevant information pertaining to their background and character for use in investigating and adjudicating their eligibility for access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a <!-- PDFPage:134 -->common set of investigative standards for background investigations for access to classified information. These standards may vary for the various levels of access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Nothing in this order shall prohibit an agency from utilizing any lawful investigative procedure in addition to the investigative requirements set forth in this order and its implementing regulations to resolve issues that may arise during the course of a background investigation or reinvestigation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.3. <em>Special Circumstances</em>. (a) In exceptional circumstances where official functions must be performed prior to the completion of the investigative and adjudication process, temporary eligibility for access to classified information may be granted to an employee while the initial investigation is underway. When such eligibility is granted, the initial investigation shall be expedited.</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Temporary eligibility for access under this section shall include a justification, and the employee must be notified in writing that further access is expressly conditioned on the favorable completion of the investigation and issuance of an access eligibility approval. Access will be immediately terminated, along with any assignment requiring an access eligibility approval, if such approval is not granted.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only by security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations and shall be based on minimum investigative standards developed by the Security Policy Board not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only to particular, identified categories of classified information necessary to perform the lawful and authorized functions that are the basis for the granting of temporary access.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed as altering the authority of an agency head to waive requirements for granting access to classified information pursuant to statutory authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Where access has been terminated under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order and a new need for access arises, access eligibility up to the same level shall be reapproved without further investigation as to employees who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years, provided they have remained employed by the same employer during the period in question, the employee certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the employee for the last background investigation, and there is no information that would tend to indicate the employee may no longer satisfy the standards established by this order for access to classified information.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Access eligibility shall be reapproved for individuals who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years and who have been retired or otherwise separated from United States Government employment for not more than 2 years; provided there is no indication the individual may no longer satisfy the standards of this order, the individual certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the individual for the last background investigation, and an appropriate record check reveals no unfavorable information.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3.4. <em>Reinvestigation Requirements</em>. (a) Because circumstances and characteristics may change dramatically over time and thereby alter the eligibility of employees for continued access to classified information, reinvestigations shall be conducted with the same priority and care as initial investigations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Employees who are eligible for access to classified information shall be the subject of periodic reinvestigations and may also be reinvestigated if, at any time, there is reason to believe that they may no longer meet the standards for access established in this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of reinvestigative standards, including the frequency of reinvestigations.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 4&mdash;INVESTIGATIONS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Authority</em>. Agencies that conduct background investigations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of State, are authorized to conduct personnel security investigations in the United States when requested by a foreign government as part of its own personnel security program and with the consent of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 5&mdash;REVIEW OF ACCESS DETERMINATIONS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5.1. <em>Determinations of Need for Access</em>. A determination under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order that an employee does not have, or no longer has, a need for access is a discretionary determination and shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5.2. <em>Review Proceedings for Denials or Revocations of Eligibility for Access</em>. (a) Applicants and employees who are determined to not meet the standards for access to classified information established in section 3.1 of this order shall be:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) provided as comprehensive and detailed a written explanation of the basis for that conclusion as the national security interests of the United States and other applicable law permit;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) provided within 30 days, upon request and to the extent the documents would be provided if requested under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the Privacy Act (3 U.S.C. 552a), as applicable, any documents, records, and reports upon which a denial or revocation is based;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;841. Findings and declarations of fact</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that the Communist Party of the United States, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States. It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship within a republic, demanding for itself the rights and privileges accorded to political parties, but denying to all others the liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. Unlike political parties, which evolve their policies and programs through public means, by the reconciliation of a wide variety of individual views, and submit those policies and programs to the electorate at large for approval or disapproval, the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders of the world Communist movement. Its members have no part in determining its goals, and are not permitted to voice dissent to party objectives. Unlike members of political parties, members of the Communist Party are recruited for indoctrination with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and disciplined to carry into action slavishly the assignments given them by their hierarchical chieftains. Unlike political <!-- PDFPage:153 -->parties, the Communist Party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations upon its conduct or upon that of its members. The Communist Party is relatively small numerically, and gives scant indication of capacity ever to attain its ends by lawful political means. The peril inherent in its operation arises not from its numbers, but from its failure to acknowledge any limitation as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence. Holding that doctrine, its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States. It is the means whereby individuals are seduced into the service of the world Communist movement, trained to do its bidding, and directed and controlled in the conspiratorial performance of their revolutionary services. Therefore, the Communist Party should be outlawed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The President may authorize any department or agency of the Government which exercises functions in connection with the national defense, acting in accordance with regulations prescribed by the President for the protection of the Government, to enter into contracts or into amendments or modifications of contracts heretofore or hereafter made and to make advance payments thereon, without regard to other provisions of law relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts, whenever he deems that such action would facilitate the national defense. The authority conferred by this section shall not be utilized to obligate the United States in an amount in excess of $50,000 without approval by an official at or above the level of an Assistant Secretary or his Deputy, or an assistant head or his deputy, of such department or agency, or by a Contract Adjustment Board established therein. The authority conferred by this section may not be utilized to obligate the United States in any amount in excess of $25,000,000 unless the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives have been notified in writing of such proposed obligation and 60 days of continuous session of Congress have expired following the date on which such notice was transmitted to such Committees. For purposes of this section, the continuity of a session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment of the Congress sine die at the end of a Congress, and the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain, or because of an adjournment sine die other than at the end of a Congress, are excluded in the computation of such 60-day period.</p>

<p class="note-body">By virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of August 28, 1958, 72 Stat. 972, hereinafter called the act [this chapter], and as President of the United States, and deeming that such action will facilitate the national defense, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Part I&mdash;Department of Defense</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under such regulations, which shall be uniform to the extent practicable, as may be prescribed or approved by the Secretary of Defense:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. The Department of Defense is authorized, within the limits of the amounts appropriated and the contract authorization provided therefor, to enter into contracts and into amendments or modifications of contracts heretofore or hereafter made, and to make advance payments thereon, without regard to the provisions of law relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts, whenever, in the judgment of the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, or the Secretary of the Air Force, or the duly authorized representative of any such Secretary, the national defense will be facilitated thereby.</p>
<p class="note-body">1A. (a) The limitation in paragraph 1 to amounts appropriated and the contract authorization provided therefor shall not apply to contractual provisions which provide that the United States will hold harmless and indemnify the contractor against any of the claims or losses set forth in subparagraph (b), whether resulting from the negligence or wrongful act or omission of the contractor or otherwise (except as provided in subparagraph (b)(2)). This exception from the limitations of paragraph 1 shall apply only to claims or losses arising out of or resulting from risks that the contract defines as unusually hazardous or nuclear in nature. Such a contractual provision shall be approved in advance by an official at a level not below that of the Secretary of a military department and may require each contractor so indemnified to provide and maintain financial protection of such type and in such amounts as is determined by the approving official to be appropriate under the circumstances. In deciding whether to approve the use of an indemnification provision and in determining the amount of financial protection to be provided and maintained by the indemnified contractor, the appropriate official shall take into account such factors as the availability, cost and terms of private insurance, self-insurance, other proof of financial responsibility and workmen's compensation insurance. Such approval and determination, as required by the preceding two sentences, shall be final.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b)(1) Subparagraph (a) shall apply to claims (including reasonable expenses of litigation and settlement) or losses, not compensated by insurance or otherwise, of the following types:</p>
<p class="note-body">(A) Claims by third persons, including employees of the contractor, for death, personal injury, or loss of, damage to, or loss of use of property;</p>
<p class="note-body">(B) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of property of the contractor;</p>
<p class="note-body">(C) Loss of, damage to, or loss of use of property of the Government;</p>
<p class="note-body">(D) Claims arising (i) from indemnification agreements between the contractor and a subcontractor or subcontractors, or (ii) from such arrangements and further indemnification arrangements between subcontractors at any tier; provided that all such arrangements were entered into pursuant to regulations prescribed or approved by the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Indemnification and hold harmless agreements entered into pursuant to this subsection, whether between the United States and a contractor, or between a contractor and a subcontractor, or between two subcontractors, shall not cover claims or losses caused by the willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of any of the contractor's or subcontractor's directors or officers or principal officials which are (i) claims by the United States (other than those arising through subrogation) against the contractor or subcontractor, or (ii) losses affecting the property of such contractor or subcontractor. Regulations to be prescribed or approved by the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy or the Air Force shall define the scope of the term principal officials.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The United States may discharge its obligation under a provision authorized by subparagraph (a) by making payments directly to subcontractors or to third persons to whom a contractor or subcontractor may be liable.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) A contractual provision made under subparagraph (a) that provides for indemnification must also provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) notice to the United States of any claim or action against, or of any loss by, the contractor or subcontractor which is covered by such contractual provision; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) control or assistance by the United States, at its election, in the settlement or defense of any such claim or action.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, respectively, may exercise the authority herein conferred and, in their discretion and by their direction, may delegate such authority to any other military or civilian officers or officials of their respective departments, and may confer upon any such military or civilian officers or officials the power to make further delegations of such authority within their respective commands or organizations: <em>Provided</em>, That the authority herein conferred shall not be utilized to obligate the United States in an amount in excess of $50,000 without approval by an official at or above the level of an Assistant Secretary or his Deputy, or by a departmental Contract Adjustment Board.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. The contracts hereby authorized to be made shall include agreements of all kinds (whether in the form of letters of intent, purchase orders, or otherwise) for all types and kinds of property or services necessary, appropriate, or convenient for the national defense, or for the invention, development, or production of, or research concerning, any such property or services, including, but not limited to, aircraft, missiles, buildings, vessels, arms, armament, equipment or supplies of any kind, or any portion thereof, including plans, spare parts and equipment therefor, materials, supplies, facilities, utilities, machinery, machine tools, and any other equipment without any restriction of any kind as to type, character, location, or form.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. The Department of Defense may by agreement modify or amend or settle claims under contracts heretofore or hereafter made, may make advance payments upon such contracts of any portion of the contract price, and may enter into agreements with contractors or obligors modifying or releasing accrued obligations of any sort, including accrued liquidated damages or liability under surety or other bonds. Amendments or modifications of contracts may be with or without consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the same things as any original contract could have accomplished hereunder, irrespective of the time or circumstances of the making, or the form, of the contract <!-- PDFPage:165 -->amended or modified, or of the amending or modifying contract, and irrespective of rights which may have accrued under the contract or the amendments or modifications thereof.</p>
<p class="note-body">5. Proper records of all actions taken under the authority of the act shall be maintained within the Department of Defense. The Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force shall make such records available for public inspection except to the extent that they, or their duly authorized representatives, may respectively deem the disclosure of information therein to be detrimental to the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">6. The Department of Defense shall, by March 15 of each year, report to the Congress all actions taken within that department under the authority of the act during the preceding calendar year. With respect to actions which involve actual or potential cost to the United States in excess of $50,000, the report shall (except as the disclosure of such information may be deemed to be detrimental to the national security)&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) name the contractor;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) state the actual cost or estimated potential cost involved;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) describe the property or services involved; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) state further the circumstances justifying the action taken.</p>
<p class="note-body">7. There shall be no discrimination in any act performed hereunder against any person on the ground of race, religion, color, or national origin, and all contracts entered into, amended, or modified hereunder shall contain such nondiscrimination provision as otherwise may be required by statute or Executive order.</p>
<p class="note-body">8. No claim against the United States arising under any purchase or contract made under the authority of the act and this order shall be assigned except in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 1029), as amended [section 3727 of Title 31, Money and Finance, and section 15 of Title 41, Public Contracts].</p>
<p class="note-body">9. Advance payments shall be made hereunder only upon obtaining adequate security.</p>
<p class="note-body">10. Every contract entered into, amended, or modified pursuant to this order shall contain a warranty by the contractor in substantially the following terms:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Contractor warrants that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure this contract upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except bonafide employees or bonafide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the Contractor for the purpose of securing business. For breach or violation of this warranty the Government shall have the right to annul this contract without liability or, in its discretion, to deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise recover, the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">11. Except as provided in the Act of September 27, 1966, 80 Stat. 850 [which amended section 1433 of this title, sections 2310 and 2313 of Title 10, Armed Forces, and section 254 of Title 41, Public Contracts] contracts entered into, amended, or modified pursuant to authority of this order shall include a clause to the effect that the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of three years after final payment, have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor or any of his subcontractors engaged in the performance of, and involving transactions related to, such contracts or subcontracts. Before exercising the authority provided in the Act of September 27, 1966, 80 Stat. 850 the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force, or their designees, shall first determine that all reasonable efforts have been made to include the clause prescribed above and that alternate sources of supply are not reasonably available.</p>
<p class="note-body">12. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to constitute authorization hereunder for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) the use of the cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) any contract in violation of existing law relating to limitation of profits or fees;</p>

The provisions of the Walsh-Healey Act (49 Stat. 2036), as amended [sections 35 to 45 of Title 41, Public Contracts], the Davis-Bacon Act (49 Stat. 1011), as amended [sections 276a to 276a&ndash;5 of Title 40, Public Buildings, Property, and Works], the Copeland Act (48 Stat. 948), as amended, and the Eight-Hour Law (37 Stat. 137), as amended [sections 321 to 323 of Title 40], if otherwise applicable, shall apply to contracts made and performed under the authority of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">14. Nothing herein contained shall prejudice anything heretofore done under Executive Order No. 9001 of December 27, 1941, or Executive Order No. 10210 of February 2, 1951, or any amendments or extensions thereof, or the continuance in force of an action heretofore taken under those orders or any amendments or extensions thereof.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. (a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon is an essential United States foreign policy objective in the Middle East;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in order to restore full control by the Government of Lebanon over its own territory, the United States is currently participating in the multinational peacekeeping force (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the &lsquo;Multinational Force in Lebanon&rsquo;) which was established in accordance with the exchange of letters between the Governments of the United States and Lebanon dated September 25, 1982;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Multinational Force in Lebanon better enables the Government of Lebanon to establish its unity, independence, and territorial integrity;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) progress toward national political reconciliation in Lebanon is necessary; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) United States Armed Forces participating in the Multinational Force in Lebanon are now in hostilities requiring authorization of their continued presence under the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Congress determines that the requirements of section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1543(a)(1)] became operative on August 29, 1983. Consistent with section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1544(b)], the purpose of this joint resolution is to authorize the continued participation of United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) The Congress intends this joint resolution to constitute the necessary specific statutory authorization under the War Powers Resolution for continued participation by United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;authorization for continued participation of united states armed forces in the multinational force in lebanon</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. The President is authorized, for purposes of section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1544(b)], to continue participation by United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon, subject to the provisions of section 6 of this joint resolution. Such participation shall be limited to performance of the functions, and shall be subject to the limitations, specified in the agreement establishing the Multinational Force in Lebanon as set forth in the exchange of letters between the Governments of the United States and Lebanon dated September 25, 1982, except that this shall not preclude such protective measures as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the Multinational Force in Lebanon.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;reports to the congress</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. As required by section 4(c) of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1543(c)], the President shall report periodically to the Congress with respect to the situation in Lebanon, but in no event shall he report less often than once every three months. In addition to providing the information required by that section on the status, scope, and duration of hostilities involving United States Armed Forces, such reports shall describe in detail&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the activities being performed by the Multinational Force in Lebanon;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the present composition of the Multinational Force in Lebanon, including a description of the re<!-- PDFPage:182 -->sponsibilities and deployment of the armed forces of each participating country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the results of efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate the Multinational Force in Lebanon;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) how continued United States participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon is advancing United States foreign policy interests in the Middle East; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) what progress has occurred toward national political reconciliation among all Lebanese groups.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;statements of policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) The Congress declares that the participation of the armed forces of other countries in the Multinational Force in Lebanon is essential to maintain the international character of the peacekeeping function in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Congress believes that it should continue to be the policy of the United States to promote continuing discussions with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon with the objective of bringing about the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and establishing an environment which will permit the Lebanese Armed Forces to carry out their responsibilities in the Beirut area.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) It is the sense of the Congress that, not later than one year after the date of enactment of this joint resolution [Oct. 12, 1983] and at least once a year thereafter, the United States should discuss with the other members of the Security Council of the United Nations the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force to assume the responsibilities of the Multinational Force in Lebanon. An analysis of the implications of the response to such discussions for the continuation of the Multinational Force in Lebanon shall be included in the reports required under paragraph (3) of section 4 of this resolution.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;duration of authorization for united states participation in the multinational force in lebanon</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. The participation of United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon shall be authorized for purposes of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.] until the end of the eighteen-month period beginning on the date of enactment of this resolution [Oct. 12, 1983] unless the Congress extends such authorization, except that such authorization shall terminate sooner upon the occurrence of any one of the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, unless the President determines and certifies to the Congress that continued United States Armed Forces participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon is required after such withdrawal in order to accomplish the purposes specified in the September 25, 1982, exchange of letters providing for the establishment of the Multinational Force in Lebanon; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the assumption by the United Nations or the Government of Lebanon of the responsibilities of the Multinational Force in Lebanon; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the implementation of other effective security arrangements in the area; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the withdrawal of all other countries from participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;interpretation of this resolution</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. (a) Nothing in this joint resolution shall preclude the President from withdrawing United States Armed Forces participation in the Multinational Force in Lebanon if circumstances warrant, and nothing in this joint resolution shall preclude the Congress by joint resolution from directing such a withdrawal.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Nothing in this joint resolution modifies, limits, or supersedes any provision of the War Powers Resolution [50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.] or the requirement of section 4(a) of the Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983, relating to congressional authorization for any substantial expansion in the number or role of United States Armed Forces in Lebanon.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Continuation of National Emergency Declared by Ex. Ord. No. 12543</h4>
<p class="note-body">Notice of President of the United States, dated Jan. 3, 1996, 61 F.R. 383, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12543 [set out above], President Reagan declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Libya. On January 8, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12544 [set out below], the President took additional measures to block Libyan assets in the United States. The President has transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the Congress and the Federal Register every year since 1986.</p>
<p class="note-body">The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been resolved. The Government of Libya has continued its actions and policies in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United Nations Security Council, in Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993) that it demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of such terrorism. Such Libyan actions and policies pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy interests of the United States. For these reasons, the national emergency declared on January 7, 1986, and the measures adopted on January 7 and January 8, 1986, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond January 7, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Libya. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.</p>

<p class="note-body">On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order No. 12947 [set out above], I declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process. By Executive Order No. 12947 of January 23, 1995, I blocked the assets in the United States, or in the control of United States persons, of foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process. I also prohibited transactions or dealings by United States persons in such property. Because terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East peace process and vital interests of the United States in the Middle East, the national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures that took effect on January 24, 1995, to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 1996. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This chapter may be cited as the &ldquo;David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The security of the United States is and will continue to depend on the ability of the United States to exercise international leadership.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The ability of the United States to exercise international leadership is, and will increasingly continue to be, based on the political and economic strength of the United States, as well as on United States military strength around the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Recent changes in the world pose threats of a new kind to international stability as Cold War tensions continue to decline while economic competition, regional conflicts, terrorist activities, and weapon proliferations have dramatically increased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The future national security and economic well-being of the United States will depend substantially on the ability of its citizens to communicate and compete by knowing the languages and cultures of other countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Federal Government has an interest in ensuring that the employees of its departments and agencies with national security responsibilities are prepared to meet the challenges of this changing international environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Federal Government also has an interest in taking actions to alleviate the problem of American undergraduate and graduate students being inadequately prepared to meet the challenges posed by increasing global interaction among nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) American colleges and universities must place a new emphasis on improving the teaching of foreign languages, area studies, and other international fields to help meet those challenges.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To provide the necessary resources, accountability, and flexibility to meet the national security education needs of the United States, especially as such needs change over time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To increase the quantity, diversity, and quality of the teaching and learning of subjects in the fields of foreign languages, area studies, and other international fields that are critical to the Nation's interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To produce an increased pool of applicants for work in the departments and agencies of the United States Government with national security responsibilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To expand, in conjunction with other Federal programs, the international experience, knowledge base, and perspectives on which the United States citizenry, Government employees, and leaders rely.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To permit the Federal Government to advocate the cause of international education.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In selecting the recipients for awards of scholarships, fellowships, or grants pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary or a contract organization referred to in subsection (a)(4) of this section, as the case may be, shall take into consideration (1) the extent to which the selections will result in there being an equitable geographic distribution of such scholarships, fellowships, or grants (as the case may be) among the various regions of the United States, and (2) the extent to which the distribution of scholarships and fellowships to individuals reflects the cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity of the population of the United States.</p>

The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt, except that where such average rate is not a multiple of 1/8 of 1 percent, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of 1/8 of 1 percent next lower than such average rate. Such special obligations shall be issued only if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the purchases of other interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or of obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or original issue or at the market price, is not in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority to sell obligations</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annuity of participant</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Computation of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the participant's high-3 average pay (as defined in paragraph (4)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of years, not exceeding 35, of service credit (determined in accordance with sections 2081 and 2082 of this title) multiplied by 2 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit for unused sick leave</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The total service of a participant who retires on an immediate annuity (except under section 2051 of this title) or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to an annuity shall include (without regard to the 35-year limitation prescribed in paragraph (1)) the days of unused sick leave to the credit of the participant. Days of unused sick leave may not be counted in determining average basic pay or eligibility for an annuity under this subchapter. A deposit shall not be required for days of unused sick leave credited under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Crediting of part-time service</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a participant whose service includes service on a part-time basis performed after April 6, 1986, the participant's annuity shall be the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Computation of pre-April 7, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service before April 7, 1986, shall be the amount computed under paragraph (1) using the participant's length of service before that date (increased by the unused sick leave to the credit of the participant at the time of retirement) and the participant's high-3 average pay.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Computation of post-April 6, 1986, annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The portion of an annuity referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to service after April 6, 1986, shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount computed under paragraph (1), using the participant's length of service after that date and the participant's high-3 average pay, as determined <!-- PDFPage:255 -->by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ratio which the participant's actual service after April 6, 1986 (as determined by prorating the participant's total service after that date to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis) bears to the total service after that date that would be creditable for the participant if all the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of employment on temporary or intermittent basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Employment on a temporary or intermittent basis shall not be considered to be service on a part-time basis for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) High-3 average pay defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a participant's high-3 average pay is the amount of the participant's average basic pay for the highest 3 consecutive years of the participant's service for which full contributions have been made to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Computation of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the aggregate period of service upon which an annuity is to be based, any fractional part of a month shall not be counted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reduction in participant's annuity to provide spouse or former spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except to the extent provided otherwise under a written election under subparagraph (B) or (C), if at the time of retirement a participant or former participant is married (or has a former spouse who has not remarried before attaining age 55), the participant shall receive a reduced annuity and provide a survivor annuity for the participant's spouse under this subsection or former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title, or a combination of such annuities, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Joint election for waiver or reduction of spouse survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A married participant or former participant and the participant's spouse may jointly elect in writing at the time of retirement to waive a survivor annuity for that spouse under this section or to reduce such survivor annuity under this section by designating a portion of the annuity of the participant as the base for the survivor annuity. If the marriage is dissolved following an election for such a reduced annuity and the spouse qualifies as a former spouse, the base used in calculating any annuity of the former spouse under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed the portion of the participant's annuity designated under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Joint election of participant and former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a participant or former participant has a former spouse, such participant and the participant's former spouse may jointly elect by spousal agreement under section 2094(b) of this title to waive, reduce, or increase a survivor annuity under section 2032(b) of this title for that former spouse. Any such election must be made (i) before the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date on which the divorce or annulment involving that former spouse becomes final, or (ii) at the time of retirement of the participant, whichever is later.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Unilateral elections in absence of spouse or former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Director may prescribe regulations under which a participant or former participant may make an election under subparagraph (B) or (C) without the participant's spouse or former spouse if the participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Director that the participant does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the whereabouts of the spouse or former spouse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of reduction in participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a participant or former participant providing a survivor annuity under this section (or section 2032(b) of this title), excluding any portion of the annuity not designated or committed as a base for any survivor annuity, shall be reduced by 21/2 percent of the first $3,600 plus 10 percent of any amount over $3,600. The reduction under this paragraph shall be calculated before any reduction under section 2032(a)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount of surviving spouse annuity</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a retired participant receiving a reduced annuity under this subsection dies and is survived by a spouse, a survivor annuity shall be paid to the surviving spouse. The amount of the annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of (i) the full amount of the participant's annuity computed under subsection (a) of this section, or (ii) any lesser amount elected as the base for the survivor annuity under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount of the annuity calculated under subparagraph (A) for a surviving spouse in any case in which there is also a surviving former spouse of the retired participant who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title may not exceed 55 percent of the portion (if any) of the base for survivor annuities which remains available under section 2032(b)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effective date and termination of annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An annuity payable from the fund to a surviving spouse under this paragraph shall commence on the day after the retired participant dies and shall terminate on the last day of the month before the surviving spouse's death or remarriage before attaining age 55. If such survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, it shall be re<!-- PDFPage:256 -->stored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce if any lump sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) 18-month open period after retirement to provide spouse coverage</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The deposit required by this subparagraph may be made by the surviving spouse of the retired participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A surviving spouse who married a participant after the participant's retirement shall be entitled to a survivor annuity payable from the fund only upon electing that annuity instead of any other survivor annuity to which the surviving spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the retired participant.</p>

Such supplemental survivor annuity shall be equal to 55 percent of the supplemental annuity of the annuitant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall prescribe regulations to provide for the application of paragraph (1) of this subsection and of subsection (b) of section 2111 of this title in any case in which an annuitant has a former spouse who was married to the recalled annuitant at any time during the <!-- PDFPage:259 -->period of recall service and who qualifies for an annuity under section 2032(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Offset of annuities by amount of social security benefit</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to that proportion of 50 percent of such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse is not qualified for an annuity under this subsection if before the commencement of that annuity the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The annuity of a former spouse under this subsection commences on the day the participant upon whose service the annuity is based becomes entitled to an annuity under this subchapter or on the first day of the month after the divorce or annulment involved becomes final, whichever is later.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:260 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of annuity</h4>

Amounts equal to the reductions under this subparagraph shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Disability annuitant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (3), in the case of a former spouse of a disability annuitant&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A former spouse of a participant, former participant, or retired participant shall not become entitled under this subsection to an annuity payable from the fund unless the former spouse elects to receive it instead of any survivor annuity to which the former spouse may be entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees on the basis of a marriage to someone other than the participant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Limitation in case of multiple former spouse annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title involving a participant may provide for an annuity or a combination of annuities under this subsection that exceeds the annuity of the participant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the annuitant throughout such creditable service, to a survivor annuity equal to that proportion of 55 percent of the unreduced amount of such annuity that is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant under this subchapter bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">After the death of a participant or retired participant, a court order under section 2094(b) of this title may not adjust the amount of the annuity of a former spouse of that participant or retired participant under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of termination of former spouse entitlement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Recomputation of participant's annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a former spouse of a retired participant dies or remarries before attaining age 55, the annuity of the retired participant, if reduced to provide a survivor annuity for that former spouse, shall be recomputed and paid, effective on the first day of the month beginning after such death or remarriage, as if the annuity had not been so reduced, unless an election is in effect under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Election of spouse annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to paragraph (4)(B), the participant may elect in writing within one year after receipt of notice of the death or remarriage of the former spouse to continue the reduction in order to provide a higher survivor annuity under section 2031(b)(3) of this title for any spouse of the participant.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disability retirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A participant who has become disabled shall, upon the participant's own application or upon order of the Director, be retired on an annuity computed under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Standard for disability determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A participant shall be considered to be disabled only if the participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is found by the Director to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the participant's position; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Director, to a vacant position in the Agency at the same grade or level and in which the participant would be able to render useful and efficient service.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:267 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Time limit for application</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) One year requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is submitted before the participant is separated from the Agency or within one year thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Waiver for mentally incompetent participant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The time limitation may be waived by the Director for a participant who, at the date of separation from the Agency or within one year thereafter, is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Agency within one year from the date of restoration of the participant to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of disability annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), an annuity payable under subsection (a) of this section shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title. However, if the disabled or incapacitated participant has less than 20 years of service credit toward retirement under the system at the time of retirement, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, but the additional service credit that may accrue to a participant under this paragraph may not exceed the difference between the participant's age at the time of retirement and age 60.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Coordination with military retired pay and veterans&rsquo; compensation and pension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a participant retiring under this section is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 2082(e)(3) of this title) or Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that participant shall be computed under section 2031(a) of this title, excluding credit for such military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the application of the limitation in section 5532 of title 5, or the Department of Veterans Affairs compensation or pension in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the annuity that would be payable under this section in the absence of the previous sentence, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under section 2031(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Medical examinations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Medical examination required for determination of disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In each case, the participant shall be given a medical examination by one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons designated by the Director to conduct examinations, and disability shall be determined by the Director on the basis of the advice of such physicians or surgeons.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual reexaminations until age 60</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the disability is permanent, like examinations shall be made annually until the annuitant becomes age 60. If the Director determines on the basis of the advice of one or more duly qualified physicians or surgeons conducting such examinations that an annuitant has recovered to the extent that the annuitant can return to duty, the annuitant may apply for reinstatement or reappointment in the Agency within one year from the date the annuitant's recovery is determined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reinstatement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon application, the Director may reinstate any such recovered disability annuitant in the grade held at time of retirement, or the Director may, taking into consideration the age, qualifications, and experience of such annuitant, and the present grade of the annuitant's contemporaries in the Agency, appoint the annuitant to a grade higher than the one held before retirement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of disability annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payment of the annuity shall continue until a date one year after the date of examination showing recovery or until the date of reinstatement or reappointment in the Agency, whichever is earlier.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payment of fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Fees for examinations under this subsection, together with reasonable traveling and other expenses incurred in order to submit to examination, may be paid out of the fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Suspension of annuity pending required examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required under this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Termination of annuity upon restoration of earning capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the annuitant receiving a disability retirement annuity is restored to earning capacity before becoming age 60, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity shall be considered to be restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment, or both, equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay for the grade and step the annuitant held at the time of retirement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of recovered disability annuitant who is not reinstated</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Separation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a recovered or restored disability annuitant whose annuity is discontinued is for any reason not reinstated or reappointed in the Agency, the annuitant shall be considered, except for service credit, to have been separated within the meaning of section 2054 of this title as of the date of termination of the disability annuity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Retirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After such termination, the recovered or restored annuitant shall be entitled to the bene<!-- PDFPage:268 -->fits of section 2054 or 2071(a) of this title, except that the annuitant may elect voluntary retirement under section 2053 of this title, if qualified thereunder, or may be placed by the Director in an involuntary retirement status under section 2055(a) of this title, if qualified thereunder. Retirement rights under this paragraph shall be based on the provisions of this subchapter in effect as of the date on which the disability annuity is discontinued.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Further disability before age 62</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, based on a current medical examination, the Director determines that a recovered annuitant has, before reaching age 62, again become totally disabled due to recurrence of the disability for which the annuitant was originally retired, the annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate) shall be reinstated from the date of such medical examination. If a restored-to-earning-capacity annuitant has not medically recovered from the disability for which retired and establishes to the Director's satisfaction that the annuitant's income from wages and self-employment in any calendar year before reaching age 62 was less than 80 percent of the rate of pay for the grade and step the annuitant held at the time of retirement, the annuitant's terminated disability annuity (same type and rate) shall be reinstated from the first of the next following year. If the annuitant has been allowed an involuntary or voluntary retirement annuity in the meantime, the annuitant's reinstated disability annuity shall be substituted for it unless the annuitant elects to retain the former benefit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Coordination of benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Workers&rsquo; compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A participant is not entitled to receive for the same period of time&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an annuity under this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) compensation for injury to, or disability of, such participant under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, other than compensation payable under section 8107 of such title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Survivor annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5 on account of the death of the same person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Greater benefit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entitlement to lump-sum credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 2082(d) of this title and subsection (b) of this section, a participant who&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Receipt of the payment of the lump-sum credit by the former participant voids all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the former participant is reemployed in service subject to this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for payment of lump-sum credit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a former participant becomes entitled to receive payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) of this section, such lump-sum credit shall be paid to the former participant and to any former spouse or former wife or husband of the former participant in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (4). The former participant's lump-sum credit shall be reduced by the amount of the lump-sum credit payable to any former spouse or former wife or husband.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Pro rata share for former spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless otherwise expressly provided by any spousal agreement or court order under section 2094(b) of this title, a former spouse of the former participant shall be entitled to receive a share of such participant's lump-sum credit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if married to the participant throughout the period of creditable service of the participant, equal to 50 percent of such lump-sum credit; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if not married to the participant throughout such creditable service, equal to a proportion of 50 percent of such lump-sum credit which is the proportion that the number of days of the marriage of the former spouse to the participant during periods of creditable service of such participant bears to the total number of days of such creditable service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Share for former wife or husband</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payment of the former participant's lump-sum credit shall be subject to the terms of a court order under section 2094(c) of this title concerning any former wife or husband of the former participant if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the court order expressly relates to any portion of such lump-sum credit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish entitlement of such former wife or husband to a survivor annuity under section 2036 of this title or to any portion of the participant's annuity under section 2094(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notification</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) only if the express written concurrence of the current spouse has been received by the Director.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">This paragraph may be waived under circumstances described in section 2031(b)(1)(D) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by such participant in a signed and witnessed writing received by the Director before the participant's death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed with the Director shall have no force or effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If there is no designated beneficiary, to the surviving wife or husband of such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If none of the above, to the child or children of such participant and descendent of deceased children by representation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Death of former participant before retirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a former participant eligible for a deferred annuity under section 2054 of this title dies before reaching age 62, such former participant's lump-sum credit shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where there is a surviving former spouse or surviving former wife or husband of such participant who is entitled to a share of such participant's lump-sum credit under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of this section, the lump-sum credit payable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the lump-sum credit payable to such former spouse or former wife or husband.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Termination of all annuity rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service of a deceased participant or annuitant terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of accrued and unpaid annuity when retired participant dies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a retired participant dies, any annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Termination of survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of a survivor annuitant shall be paid to that individual. An annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a survivor annuitant shall be paid in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other individual:</p>

Instead of an annuity recomputation, the annuity of such participant shall be reduced at age 62 by an amount equal to a fraction of the participant's old-age or survivors&rsquo; insurance benefits under section 402 of title 42. The reduction shall be determined by multiplying the participant's monthly Social Security benefit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's total military wages and deemed additional wages (within the meaning of section 429 of title 42) that were subject to Social Security deductions and the denominator of which is the total of all the participant's wages, including military wages, and all self-employment income that were subject to Social Security deductions before the calendar year in which the determination month occurs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Each cost-of-living annuity increase under this section shall be identical to the corresponding percentage increase under section 8340(b) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A cost-of-living increase made under paragraph (1) shall become effective under this section on the effective date of each such increase under section 8340(b) of title 5. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, each such increase shall be applied to each annuity payable from the fund which has a commencing date not later than the effective date of the increase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section shall be governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the fund as of the effective date of an increase, except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The first cost-of-living increase (if any) made under subsection (a) of this section to an annuity which is payable from the fund to a participant who retires, to the surviving spouse, former spouse, or previous spouse of a participant who dies in service, or to the surviving spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been increased under this subsection or subsection (a) of this section, shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of one percent) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1/12 of the applicable percent change computed under subsection (a) of this section, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of months (not to exceed 12 months, counting any portion of a month as a month)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for which the annuity was payable from the fund before the effective date of the increase, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a surviving spouse, former spouse, previous spouse, or insurable interest designee of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been so increased, since the annuity was first payable to the deceased annuitant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable from the fund to an annuitant's survivor (other than a child entitled to an annuity under section 2031(d) of this title) shall be increased by the total percentage increase the annuitant was receiving under this section at death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) For purposes of computing the annuity of a child under section 2031(d) of this title that commences after October 31, 1969, the dollar amounts specified in section 2031(d)(3) of this title shall each be increased by the total percentage increases allowed and in force under this section on or after such day and, in the case of a deceased annuitant, the percentages specified in that section shall be increased by the total percent allowed and in force to the annuitant under this section on or after such day.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An annuity increase provided by this section may not be computed on any additional annuity purchased at retirement by voluntary contributions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rounding to next lower dollar</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The monthly annuity installment, after adjustment under this section, shall be rounded to the next lowest dollar, except that such installment shall, after adjustment, reflect an increase of at least $1.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on maximum amount of annuity</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An annuity shall not be increased by reason of an adjustment under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the participant with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased by the overall annual average percentage adjustments (compounded) in the rates of pay of the General Schedule under subchapter I of chapter 53 of title 5 during the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) beginning on the date on which the annuity commenced (or, in the case of a survivor of the retired participant, the date on which the participant's annuity commenced), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) ending on the effective date of the adjustment under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &ldquo;Pay&rdquo; defined</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Calculation of survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any reduction in payments to a retired employee as a result of payments to a qualified former spouse under this subsection shall be disregarded in calculating&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the survivor annuity for any spouse, former spouse (qualified or otherwise), or other survivor under chapter 84 of title 5, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any reduction in the annuity of the retired employee to provide survivor benefits under subsection (d) of this section or under sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2154_2_target" name="2154_2">2</a></sup> 8442 or 8445 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a retired employee whose annuity is reduced under paragraph (1) is recalled to service under section 2152(c) of this title, the basic pay of that annuitant shall be reduced by the same amount as the annuity would have been reduced if it had continued.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(B), in the case of an employee who has elected to become subject to chapter 84 of title 5, the share of such employee's qualified former spouse shall equal the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 50 percent of the employee's annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or under subchapter II of this chapter (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees&rsquo; Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable service before the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee's total creditable service before such effective date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if applicable, 50 percent of the employee's benefits under chapter 84 of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees&rsquo; Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title), multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee's total creditable service after such effective date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Treatment of pro rata share under title 26</h4>

For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;assumed CIARDS annuity&rdquo; means the amount of the survivor annuity to which the widow or widower would be entitled under subchapter II of this chapter based on the service of the deceased annuitant determined under section 8442(f)(5) of such title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:286 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disqualification upon remarriage before age 55</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Restoration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the survivor annuity payable under this subsection to a surviving qualified former spouse is terminated because of remarriage before becoming age 55, the annuity shall be restored at the same rate commencing on the date such remarriage is dissolved by death, divorce, or annulment, if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Modification of court order or spousal agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A modification in a court order or spousal agreement to adjust a qualified former spouse's share of the survivor benefits shall not be effective if issued after the retirement or death of the employee, former employee, or annuitant, whichever occurs first.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Effect of termination of qualified former spouse's entitlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After a qualified former spouse of a retired employee remarries before becoming age 55 or dies, the reduction in the retired employee's annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for such former spouse shall be terminated. The annuitant may elect, in a signed writing received by the Director within 2 years after the qualified former spouse's remarriage or death, to continue the reduction in order to provide or increase the survivor annuity for such annuitant's spouse. The annuitant making such election shall pay a deposit in accordance with the provisions of section 8418 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Pro rata share in case of employees transferred to FERS</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if applicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 50 percent of the employee's annuity under chapter 84 of title 5 or section 2152(a) of this title (computed in accordance with section 302(a) of the Federal Employees&rsquo; Retirement System Act of 1986 or section 2157 of this title), plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the survivor benefits referred to in subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">multiplied by the proportion that the number of days of marriage during the period of the employee's creditable service on and after the effective date of the election to transfer bears to the employee's total creditable service after such effective date.</p>
