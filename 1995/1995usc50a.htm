The master of every vessel that transmits the Panama Canal (a) shall prior to the beginning of each transit cause all cameras on board such vessel, or which are brought on board by embarking passengers, or otherwise, to be collected and delivered to him, and shall retain the said cameras in his possession, in a secure and inaccessible place, until the disembarkation of the original possessors thereof or until the transit through the Canal is completed, and (b) shall during such transit take such further action, in cooperation with the Canal authorities, as may be necessary to prevent the making, by any person on board such vessel in the waters of the Canal Zone, of any photograph, sketch, picture, drawing, map, or graphical representation which is forbidden by this paragraph; but these provisions shall not apply with respect to any person who has obtained permission as provided in this paragraph. Any person who shall violate any provision of this paragraph shall be punishable as provided in section 9 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Any person not an enemy or ally of enemy claiming any interest, right, or title in any money or other property which may have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States, or to whom any debt may be owing from an enemy or ally of enemy whose property or any part thereof shall have been conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States may file with the said custodian a notice of his claim under oath and in such form and containing such particulars as the said custodian shall require; and the President, if application is made therefor by the claimant, may order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States, or of the interest therein to which the President shall determine said claimant is entitled: <em>Provided</em>, That no such order by the President shall bar any person from the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the claimant to establish any right, title, or interest which he may have in such money or other property. If the President shall not so order within sixty days after the filing of such application or if the claimant shall have filed the notice as above required and shall have made no application to the President, said claimant may institute a suit in equity in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the district in which such claimant resides, or, if a corporation, where it has its principal place of business (to which suit the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as the case may be, shall be made a party defendant), to establish the interest, right, title, or debt so claimed, and if so established the court shall order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States or the interest therein to which the court shall determine said claimant is entitled. If suit shall be so instituted, then such money or property shall be retained in the custody of the Alien Property Custodian, or in the Treasury of the United States, as provided in this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], and until any final judgment or decree which shall be entered in favor of the claimant shall be fully satisfied by payment or conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery by the defendant, or by the Alien Property Custodian, or Treasurer of the United States on order of the court, or until final judgment or decree shall be entered against the claimant or suit otherwise terminated: <em>Provided further</em>, That upon a determination made by the President, in time of war or during any national emergency declared by the <!-- PDFPage:22 -->President, that the interest and welfare of the United States require the sale of any property or interest or any part thereof claimed in any suit filed under this subsection and pending on or after the date of enactment [Oct. 22, 1962] of this proviso the Alien Property Custodian or any successor officer, or agency may sell such property or interest or part thereof, in conformity with law applicable to sales of property by him, at any time prior to the entry of final judgment in such suit. No such sale shall be made until thirty days have passed after the publication of notice in the Federal Register of the intention to sell. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be deposited in a special account established in the Treasury, and shall be held in trust by the Secretary of the Treasury pending the entry of final judgment in such suit. Any recovery of any claimant in any such suit in respect of the property or interest or part thereof so sold shall be satisfied from the net proceeds of such sale unless such claimant, within sixty days after receipt of notice of the amount of net proceeds of sale serves upon the Alien Property Custodian, or any successor officer or agency, and files with the court an election to waive all claims to the net proceeds, or any part thereof, and to claim just compensation instead. If the court finds that the claimant has established an interest, right, or title in any property in respect of which such an election has been served and filed, it shall proceed to determine the amount which will constitute just compensation for such interest, right, or title, and shall order payment to the claimant of the amount so determined. An order for the payment of just compensation hereunder shall be a judgment against the United States and shall be payable first from the net proceeds of the sale in an amount not to exceed the amount the claimant would have received had he elected to accept his proportionate part of the net proceeds of the sale, and the balance, if any, shall be payable in the same manner as are judgments in cases arising under section 1346 of title 28, United States Code. The Alien Property Custodian or any successor officer or agency shall, immediately upon the entry of final judgment, notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the determination by final judgment of the claimant's interest and right to the proportionate part of the net proceeds from the sale, and the final determination by judgment of the amount of just compensation in the event the claimant has elected to recover just compensation for the interest in the property he claimed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any person whose money or other property the President is authorized to return under the provisions of subsection (b) hereof may file notice of claim for the return of such money or other property, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, and thereafter may make application to the President for allowance of such claim and/or may institute suit in equity to recover such money or other property, as provided in said subsection, and with like effect. The President or the court, as the case may be, may make the same determinations with respect to citizenship and other relevant facts that the President is authorized to make under the provisions of subsection (b) hereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever an individual, deceased, would have been entitled, if living, to the return of any money or other property without filing the written consent provided for in subsection (m), then his legal representative may proceed for the return of such money or other property in the same manner as such individual might proceed if living, and such money or other property may be returned to such legal representative without requiring the appointment of an administrator, or an ancillary administrator, by a court in the United States, or to any such ancillary administrator, for distribution directly to the persons entitled thereto. Return in accordance with the provisions of this subsection may be made in any case where an application or court proceeding by any legal representative, under the provisions of this subsection before its amendment by the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167, &sect;12(a), 45 Stat. 271] is pending and undetermined at the time of the enactment of such Act. All bonds or other security given under the provisions of this subsection before such amendment shall be canceled or released and all sureties thereon discharged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No money or other property shall be returned nor any debt allowed under this section to any person who is a citizen or subject of any nation which was associated with the United States in the prosecution of the war, unless such nation in like case extends reciprocal rights to citizens of the United States: <em>Provided</em>, That any arrangement made by a foreign nation for the release of money and other property of American citizens and certified by the Secretary of State to the Attorney General as fair and the most advantageous arrangement obtainable shall be regarded as meeting this requirement; nor in any event shall a debt be allowed under this section unless it was owing to and owned by the claimant prior to October 6, 1917, and as to claimants other than citizens of the United States unless it arose with reference to the money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian or Treasurer of the United States hereunder; nor shall a debt be allowed under this section unless notice of the claim has been filed, or application therefor has been made, prior to the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167, 45 Stat. 254].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except as herein provided, the money or other property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, shall not be liable to lien, attachment, garnishment, trustee process, or execution, or subject to any order or decree of any court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Whenever an individual, deceased, would have been entitled, if living, to the return of any money or other property upon filing the written consent provided for in subsection (m), then his legal representative may proceed for the return of such money or other property in the same manner as such individual might proceed if living, and such money or other property may be returned, upon filing the written consent provided for in subsection (m), to such legal representative without requiring the appointment of an administrator, or an ancillary administrator, by a court in the United States, or to any such ancillary administrator, for distribution to the persons entitled thereto. This subsection shall not be construed as extinguishing or diminishing any right which any citizen of the United States may have had under this subsection prior to its amendment by the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, <!-- PDFPage:25 -->1928, ch. 167, &sect;12(c), 45 Stat. 271] to receive in full his interest in the property of any individual dying before such amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The aggregate value of the money or other property returned under paragraphs (9) and (10) of subsection (b) to any one person, irrespective of the number of trusts involved, shall in no case exceed $10,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) For the purposes of paragraphs (9) and (10) of subsection (b) of this section accumulated net income, dividends, interest, annuities, and other earnings, shall be considered as part of the principal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed to return to the person entitled thereto, whether or not an enemy or ally of enemy and regardless of the value, any patent, trademark, print, label, copyright, or right therein or claim thereto, which was conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian, or seized by him, and which has not been sold, licensed, or otherwise disposed of under the provisions of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], and to return any such patent, trademark, print, label, copyright, or right therein or claim thereto, which has been licensed, except that any patent, trade-mark, print, label, copyright, or right therein or claim thereto, which is returned by the Alien Property Custodian and which has been licensed, or in respect of which any contract has been entered into, or which is subject to any lien or encumbrance, shall be returned subject to the license, contract, lien, or encumbrance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Except as provided in section 27 [section 27 of this Appendix], paragraphs (12) to (22), both inclusive, of subsection (b) of this section shall apply to the proceeds received from the sale, license, or other disposition of any patent, trademark, print, label, copyright, or right therein or claim thereto, conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered to the Alien Property Custodian, or seized by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) This section shall apply to royalties paid to the Alien Property Custodian, in accordance with a judgment or decree in a suit brought under subsection (f) of section 10 [section 10(f) of this Appendix]; but shall not apply to any other money paid to the Alien Property Custodian under section 10 [section 10 of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) No money or other property shall be returned under paragraph (12), (13), (14), or (16) of subsection (b) or under subsection (g) or (n) or (to the extent therein provided) under subsection (p), unless the person entitled thereto files a written consent to a postponement of the return of an amount equal to 20 per centum of the aggregate value of such money or other property (at the time, as nearly as may be, of the return), as determined by the Alien Property Custodian, and the investment of such amount in accordance with the provisions of section 25 [section 25 of this Appendix]. Such amount shall be deducted from the money to be returned to such person, so far as possible, and the balance shall be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of so much of the property as may be necessary, unless such person pays the balance to the Alien Property Custodian, except that no property shall be sold prior to the expiration of six years from the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167, 45 Stat. 254] without the consent of the person entitled thereto. The amounts so deducted shall be returned to the persons entitled thereto as provided in subsection (f) of section 25 [section 25(f) of this Appendix]. The sale of any such property shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 12 [section 12 of this Appendix], except that the provisions of such section relating to sales or resales to, or for the benefit of, citizens of the United States shall not be applicable. If such aggregate value of the money or other property to be returned under paragraph (12), (13), (14), or (16) of subsection (b) or under subsection (g) is less than $2,000, then the written consent shall not be required and the money or other property shall be returned in full without the temporary retention and investment of 20 per centum thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) The provisions of paragraph (12), (13), (14), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), or (22) of subsection (b), or of subsection (m) or (n) of this section, and (except to the extent therein provided) the provisions of paragraph (16) of subsection (b), shall not be construed as diminishing or extinguishing any right under any other provision of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] in force immediately prior to the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167, 45 Stat. 254].</p>

Subject to the above provisions as to the collection of debts, each such successor (except the German Government and members of the former ruling family) may proceed for the return of the amount so transferred to his trust, in the same manner as such partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation might proceed if still in existence. If such partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation, would have been entitled to the return of its money or other property only upon filing the written consent provided for in subsection (m), then the successor shall be entitled to the return under this subsection only upon filing such written consent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(q) The return of money or other property under paragraph (15), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), or (22) of subsection (b) (relating to the return of Austrian and Hungarian nationals) shall be subject to the limitations imposed by subsections (d) and (e) of section 7 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Act Mar. 10, 1928, ch. 167, &sect;7(d), (e), 45 Stat. 265, 266].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Repealed. Aug. 8, 1946, ch. 910, &sect;13, 60 Stat. 944.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any citizen of the United States, or any corporation organized within the United States, may, when duly authorized by the President, pay to an enemy or ally of enemy any tax, annuity, or fee which may be required by the laws of such enemy or ally of enemy nation in relation to patents and trade-marks, prints, labels, and copyrights; and any such citizen or corporation may file and prosecute an application for letters patent or for registration of trade-mark, print, label, or copyright in the country of an enemy, or of an ally of enemy after first submitting such application to the President and receiving license so to file and prosecute, and to pay the fees required by law and customary agents&rsquo; fees, the maximum amount of which in each case shall be subject to the control of the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any citizen of the United States or any corporation organized within the United States desiring to manufacture, or cause to be manufactured, a machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or design, or to carry on, or to use any trade-mark, print, label or cause to be carried on, a process under any patent or copyrighted matter owned or controlled by an enemy or ally of enemy at any time during the existence of a state of war may apply to the President for a license; and the President is authorized to grant such a license, nonexclusive or exclusive as he shall deem best, provided he shall be of the opinion that such grant is for the public welfare, and that the applicant is able and intends in good faith to manufacture, or cause to be manufactured, the machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or design, or to carry on, or cause to be carried on, the process or to use the trade-mark, print, label or copyrighted matter. The President may prescribe the conditions of this license, including the fixing of prices of articles and products necessary to the health of the military and naval forces of the United States or the successful prosecution of the war, and the rules and regulations under which such license may be granted and the fee which shall be charged therefor, not exceeding $100, and not exceeding one per centum of the fund deposited as hereinafter provided. Such license shall be a complete defense to any suit at law or in equity instituted by the enemy or ally of enemy owners of the letters patent, trade-mark, print, label or copyright, or otherwise, against the licensee for infringement or for damages, royalty, or other money award on account of anything done by the licensee under such license, except as provided in subsection (f) hereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The licensee shall file with the President a full statement of the extent of the use and enjoyment of the license, and of the prices received in such form and at such stated periods (at least annually) as the President may prescribe; and the licensee shall pay at such times as may be required to the alien property custodian not to exceed five per centum of the gross sums received by the licensee from the sale of said inventions or use of the trade-mark, print, label or copyrighted matter, or, if the President shall so order, five per centum of the value of the use of such inventions, trade-marks, prints, labels or copyrighted matter to the licensee as established by the President; and sums so paid shall be deposited by said alien property custodian forthwith in the Treasury of the United States as a trust fund for the said licensee and for the owner of the said patent, trade-mark, print, label or copyright registration as hereinafter provided, to be paid from the Treasury upon order of the court, as provided in subsection (f) of this section, or upon the direction of the alien property custodian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Unless surrendered or terminated as provided in this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], any license granted hereunder shall continue during the term fixed in the license or in the absence of any such limitation during the term of the patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright registration under which is it granted. Upon violation by the licensee of any of the provisions of this Act [said sections], or of the conditions of the license, the President may, after due notice and hearing, cancel any license granted by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The owner of any patent, trade-mark, print, label, or copyright under which a license is granted hereunder may, after the end of the war and until the expiration of one year thereafter, file a bill in equity against the licensee in the district court of the United States for the district in which the said licensee resides, or, if a corporation, in which it has its principal place of business (to which suit the Treasurer of the United States shall be made a party), for recovery from the said licensee for all use and enjoyment of the said patented invention, trade-mark, print, label, or copyrighted matter: <em>Provided, however</em>, That whenever suit is brought, as above, notice shall be filed with the alien property custodian within thirty days after date of entry of suit: <em>Provided further</em>, That the licensee may make any and all defenses which would be available were no license granted. The court on due proceedings had may adjudge and decree to the said owner payment of a reasonable royalty. The amount of said judgment and decree, when final, shall be paid on order of the court to the <!-- PDFPage:28 -->owner of the patent from the fund deposited by the licensee, so far as such deposit will satisfy said judgment and decree; and the said payment shall be in full or partial satisfaction of said judgment and decree, as the facts may appear; and if, after payment of all such judgments and decrees, there shall remain any balance of said deposit, such balance shall be repaid to the licensee on order of the alien property custodian. If no suit is brought within one year after the end of the war, or no notice is filed as above required, then the licensee shall not be liable to make any further deposits, and all funds deposited by him shall be repaid to him on order of the alien property custodian.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;24. Payment of taxes and expenses by Alien Property Custodian</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized to pay all taxes (including special assessments), heretofore or hereafter lawfully assessed by any body politic against any money or other property held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States under this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], and to pay the necessary expenses incurred by him or by any depositary for him in securing the possession, collection, or control of any such money or other property, or in protecting or administering the same. Such taxes and expenses shall be paid out of the money or other property against which such taxes are assessed or in respect of which such expenses are incurred, or (if such money or other property is insufficient) out of any other money or property held for the same person, notwithstanding the fact that a claim may have been filed or suit instituted under this Act [said sections]. No claim shall be filed with the Alien Property Custodian or allowed by him or by the President of the United States, nor shall any suit be instituted or maintained against the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, or the United States, under any provisions of law, by any person who was an enemy or ally of enemy as defined in the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended [said sections], and no allowance of any such claim now pending shall be made, nor judgment entered in any such suit heretofore or hereafter instituted, for the recovery of any deduction or deductions, heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from money or properties, or income therefrom, held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for the general or administrative expenses of the office of the Alien Property Custodian, which deduction or deductions on the collection of any income do not exceed the sum of two per centum of such income or which on the return of any moneys or properties or income therefrom, do not exceed the sum of two per centum of the aggregate value thereof at the time or times as nearly as may be, of such deduction or deductions, or, for the recovery of any deduction or deductions heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from money or properties or income therefrom held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for any and all necessary expenses incurred and actually disbursed by the Alien Property Custodian or by any depositary for him in securing the possession, collection or control of any such money or properties or income therefrom, or in protecting or administering the same, as said general or administrative and other expenses and said aggregate value of returned money or properties or income therefrom have been heretofore or shall be hereafter determined by said Alien Property Custodian.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In the case of income, war-profits, excess-profits, or estate taxes imposed by any Act of Congress, the amount thereof shall, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be computed in the same manner (except as hereinafter in this section provided) as though the money or other property had not been seized by or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be paid as far as practicable, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. Pending final determination of the tax liability the Alien Property Custodian is authorized to return, in accordance with the provisions of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], money or other property in any trust in such amounts as may be determined, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to be consistent with the prompt payment of the full amount of the internal-revenue taxes. Notwithstanding the expiration of any period of limitation provided by law, credit or refund of any income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected may be made or allowed if claim therefor was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the Alien Property Custodian on or before February 15, 1933.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) So much of the net income of a taxpayer for the taxable year 1917, or any succeeding taxable year, as represents the gain derived from the sale or exchange by the Alien Property Custodian of any property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to him, or seized by him, may at the option of the taxpayer be segregated from the net income and separately taxed at the rate of 30 per centum. This subsection shall be applied and the amount of net income to be so segregated shall be determined, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, as nearly as may be in the same manner as provided in section 208 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (relating to capital net gains), but without regard to the period for which the property was held by the Alien Property Custodian before its sale or exchange, and whether or not the taxpayer is an individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Any property sold or exchanged by the Alien Property Custodian (whether before or after the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Mar. 10, 1928]) shall be considered as having been compulsorily or involuntarily converted, within the meaning of the income, excess-profits, and war-profits tax laws and regulations; and the provisions of such laws and regulations relating to such a conversion shall (under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with <!-- PDFPage:36 -->the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury) apply in the case of the proceeds of such sale or exchange. For the purpose of determining whether the proceeds of such conversion have been expended within such time as will entitle the taxpayer to the benefits of such laws and regulations relating to such a conversion, the date of the return of the proceeds to the person entitled thereto shall be considered as the date of the conversion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In case of any internal-revenue tax imposed in respect of property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, or seized by him, and imposed in respect of any period (in the taxable year 1917 or any succeeding taxable year) during which such property was held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States, no interest or civil penalty shall be assessed upon, collected from, or paid by or on behalf of, the taxpayer; nor shall any interest be credited or paid to the taxpayer in respect of any credit or refund allowed or made in respect of such tax.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The benefits of subsections (c), (d), and (e) shall be extended to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable thereto, or before the expiration of six months after the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Mar. 10, 1928], whichever date is the later.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) When in the case of any trust written consent under subsection (m) of section 9 [section 9(m) of this Appendix] has been filed, an amount equal to the portion of such trust the return of which is temporarily postponed under such subsection shall be credited against the investment made under paragraph (1) of this subsection. If the total amount so credited is in excess of the amount invested under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the excess shall be invested by the Alien Property Custodian in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, without regard to the $40,000,000 limitation in paragraph (1). If the amount invested under paragraph (1) of this subsection is in excess of the total amount so credited, such excess shall, from time to time on request of the Alien Property Custodian, be paid to him out of the funds in the German special deposit account created by section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, and such payments shall have priority over any payments therefrom other than the payments under paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of such section (relating to expenses of administration).</p>

If, after the allocation under section 26 [section 26 of this Appendix] has been made, the amount of the unallocated interest fund allocated to the trust described in subsection (c) of such section is found to be in excess of $25,000,000, such excess shall be invested by the Alien Property Custodian in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. If the amount so allocated is found to be less than $25,000,000 any participating certificate or certificates that have been issued shall be corrected accordingly; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The balance of such unallocated interest fund remaining after the investment provided for in paragraph (1) and the payment of allocated earnings in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of section 26 [section 26(b) of this Appendix] have been made.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:37 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) If the amount of such unallocated interest fund, remaining after the investment required by paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this section has been made, is insufficient to pay the allocated earnings in accordance with subsection (b) of section 26 [section 26(b) of this Appendix], then the amount necessary to make up the deficiency shall be paid out of the funds in the German special deposit account created by section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, and such payment shall have priority over any payments therefrom other than the payments under paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of such section (relating to expenses of administration) and the payments under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized and directed (after the payment of debts under section 9 [section 9 of this Appendix]) to transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury, for deposit in such special deposit account, all money and the proceeds of all property, including all income, dividends, interest, annuities, and earnings accumulated in respect thereof, owned by the German Government or any member of the former ruling family. All money and other property shall be held to be owned by the German Government (1) if no claim thereto has been filed with the Alien Property Custodian prior to the expiration of three years from the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928 [Mar. 10, 1928], or (2) if any claim has been filed before the expiration of such period (whether before or after the enactment of such Act), then if the ownership thereof under any such claim is not established by a decision of the Alien Property Custodian or by suit in court instituted, under section 9 [section 9 of this Appendix], within one year after the decision of the Alien Property Custodian, or after the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, whichever date is later. The amounts so transferred under this subsection shall be credited upon the final payment due the United States from the German Government on account of the awards of the Mixed Claims Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to issue to the Alien Property Custodian, upon such terms and conditions and under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, one or more participating certificates, bearing interest payable annually (as nearly as may be) at the rate of 5 per centum per annum, as evidence of the investment by the Alien Property Custodian under subsection (a), and one or more non-interest bearing participating certificates, as evidence of the investment by the Alien Property Custodian under subsection (b). All such certificates shall evidence a participating interest, in accordance with, and subject to the priorities of, the provisions of section 4 of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, in the funds in the German special deposit account created by such section, except that&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;34. Payment of debts</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Claims allowable; defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any property or interest vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian (other than any property or interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the net proceeds thereof, shall be equitably applied by the Custodian in accordance with the provisions of this section to the payment of debts owed by the person who owned such property or interest immediately prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian. No debt claim shall be allowed under this section if it was not due and owing at the time of such vesting or transfer, or if it arose from any action or transactions prohibited by or pursuant to this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] and not licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant thereto, or (except in the case of debt claims acquired by the Custodian) if it was at the time of such vesting or transfer due and owing to any person who has since the beginning of the war been convicted of violation of this Act, as amended [said sections], sections 1 to 6 of the Criminal Code, title I of the Act of June 15, 1917 (ch. 30, 40 Stat. 217), as amended; the Act of April 20, 1918 (ch. 59, 40 Stat. 534), as amended; the Act of June 8, 1934&nbsp;<sup><a href="#34_1_target" name="34_1">1</a></sup> (ch. 327, 52 Stat. 631), as amended; the Act of January 12, 1938 (ch. 2, 52 Stat. 3); title I, Alien Registration Act, 1940 (ch. 439, 54 Stat. 670); the Act of October 17, 1940 (ch. 897, 54 Stat. 1201); or the Act of June 25, 1942 (ch. 447, 56 Stat. 390). Any defense to the payment of such claims which would have been available to the debtor shall be available to the Custodian, except that the period from and after the beginning of the war shall not be included for the purpose of determining the application of any statute of limitations. Debt claims allowable hereunder shall include only those of citizens of the United States or of the Philippine Islands; those of corporations organized under the laws of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia or the Philippine Islands; those of other natural persons who are and have been since the beginning of the war residents of the United States and who have not during the war been interned or paroled pursuant to the Alien Enemy Act; and those acquired by the Custodian. Legal representatives (whether or not appointed by a court in the United States) or successors in interest by inheritance, devise, bequest, or operation of law or debt claimants, other than persons who would themselves be disqualified hereunder from allowance of a debt claim, shall be eligible for payment to the same extent as their principals or predecessors would have been.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time limit for filing claims; extension; notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Custodian shall fix a date or dates after which the filing of debt claims in respect of any or all debtors shall be barred, and may extend the time so fixed, and shall give at least sixty days&rsquo; notice thereof by publication in the Federal Register. In no event shall the time extend beyond the expiration of two years from the <!-- PDFPage:45 -->date of the last vesting in or transfer to the Custodian of any property or interest of a debtor in respect of whose debts the date is fixed, or from the date of enactment of this section [Aug. 8, 1946], whichever is later. No debt shall be paid prior to the expiration of one hundred and twenty days after publication of the first such notice in respect of the debtor, nor in any event shall any payment of a debt claim be made out of any property or interest or proceeds in respect of which a suit or proceeding pursuant to this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] for return is pending and was instituted prior to the expiration of such one hundred and twenty days.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Examination of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Custodian shall examine the claims, and such evidence in respect thereof as may be presented to him or as he may introduce into the record, and shall make a determination, with respect to each claim, of allowance or disallowance, in whole or in part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funds for debt payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payment of debt claims shall be made only out of such money included in, or received as net proceeds from the sale, use, or other disposition of, any property or interest owned by the debtor immediately prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian, as shall remain after deduction of (1) the amount of the expenses of the Office of Alien Property Custodian (including both expenses in connection with such property or interest or proceeds thereof, and such portion as the Custodian shall fix of the other expenses of the Office of Alien Property Custodian), and of taxes, as defined in section 36 hereof [section 36 of this Appendix], paid by the Custodian in respect of such property or interest or proceeds, and (2) such amount, if any, as the Custodian may establish as a cash reserve for the future payment of such expenses and taxes. If the money available hereunder for the payment of debt claims against the debtor is insufficient for the satisfaction of all claims allowed by the Custodian, ratable payments shall be made in accordance with subsection (g) hereof to the extent permitted by the money available and additional payments shall be made whenever the Custodian shall determine that substantial further money has become available, through liquidation of any such property or interest or otherwise. The Custodian shall not be required through any judgment of any court, levy of execution, or otherwise to sell or liquidate any property or interest vested in or transferred to him, for the purpose of paying or satisfying any debt claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount payable; disallowance; notice; review; additional evidence; judgment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed does not exceed the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made, the Custodian shall pay each claim to the extent allowed, and shall serve by registered mail, on each claimant whose claim is disallowed in whole or in part, a notice of such disallowance. Within sixty days after the date of mailing of the Custodian's determination, any debt claimant whose claim has been disallowed in whole or in part may file in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of such disallowance naming the Custodian as defendant. Such complaint shall be served on the Custodian. The Custodian, within forty-five days after service on him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of proceedings in the Office of Alien Property Custodian with respect to the claim in question. Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claim as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the Custodian or introduced into the record by him, and the determination of the Custodian with respect thereto, including any findings made by him. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the Custodian, or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. The court shall enter judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the Custodian's determination, and directing payment in the amount, if any, which it finds due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Pro rata payments; notice; review; additional evidence; intervention; judgment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed exceeds the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made, the Custodian shall prepare and serve by registered mail on all claimants a schedule of all debt claims allowed and the proposed payment to each claimant. In preparing such schedule, the Custodian shall assign priorities in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) hereof. Within sixty days after the date of mailing of such schedule, any claimant considering himself aggrieved may file in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia a complaint for review of such schedule, naming the Custodian as defendant. A copy of such complaint shall be served upon the Custodian and on each claimant named in the schedule. The Custodian, within forty-five days after service on him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of proceedings in the Office of Alien Property Custodian with respect to such schedule. Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claims in question as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the Custodian or introduced into the record by him, any findings or other determinations made by the Custodian with respect thereto, and the schedule prepared by the Custodian. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the Custodian or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. Any interested debt claimant who has filed a claim with the Custodian pursuant to this section, upon timely application to the court, shall be permitted to intervene in such review proceedings. The court shall enter judgment affirming or modifying the schedule as prepared by the Custodian and directing payment, if any be found due, pursuant to the schedule as affirmed or modified and to the extent of the money from <!-- PDFPage:46 -->which, in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made. Pending the decision of the court on such complaint for review, and pending final determination of any appeal from such decision, payment may be made only to an extent, if any, consistent with the contentions of all claimants for review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Priority of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Debt claims shall be paid in the following order of priority: (1) Wage and salary claims, not to exceed $600; (2) claims entitled to priority under sections 191 and 193 of title 31&nbsp;<sup><a href="#34_2_target" name="34_2">2</a></sup> of the United States Code [31 U.S.C. 3713(a) and 9309], except as provided in subsection (h) hereof, (3) all other claims for services rendered, for expenses incurred in connection with such services, for rent, for goods and materials delivered to the debtor, and for payments made to the debtor for goods or services not received by the claimant; (4) all other debt claims. No payment shall be made to claimants within a subordinate class unless the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) hereof, payment may be made permits payment in full of all allowed claims in every prior class.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Priority as debt due United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No debt of any kind shall be entitled to priority under any law of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, solely by reason of becoming a debt due or owing to the United States as a result of its acquisition by the Alien Property Custodian.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Exclusiveness of relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The sole relief and remedy available to any person seeking satisfaction of a debt claim out of any property or interest which shall have been vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian (other than any property or interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the proceeds thereof, shall be the relief and remedy provided in this section, and suits for the satisfaction of debt claims shall not be instituted, prosecuted, or further maintained except in conformity with this section: <em>Provided</em>, That no person asserting any interest, right, or title in any property or interest or proceeds acquired by the Alien Property Custodian, shall be barred from proceeding pursuant to this Act [sections 1 to 6, and 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix] for the return thereof, by reason of any proceeding which he may have brought pursuant to this section; nor shall any security interest asserted by the creditor in any such property or interest or proceeds be deemed to have been waived solely by reason of such proceeding. The Alien Property Custodian shall treat all debt claims now filed with him as claims filed pursuant to this section. Nothing contained in this section shall bar any person from the prosecution of any suit at law or in equity against the original debtor or against any other person who may be liable for the payment of any debt for which a claim might have been filed hereunder. No purchaser, lessee, licensee, or other transferee of any property or interest from the Alien Property Custodian shall, solely by reason of such purchase, lease, license, or transfer, become liable for the payment of any debt owed by the person who owned such property or interest prior to its vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian. Payment by the Alien Property Custodian to any debt claimant shall constitute, to the extent of payment, a discharge of the indebtedness represented by the claim.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Liability; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The vesting in or transfer to the Alien Property Custodian of any property or interest (other than any property or interest acquired by the United States prior to December 18, 1941), or the receipt by him of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax for any period prior or subsequent to the date of such vesting or transfer, nor render applicable the exemptions provided in title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] with respect to service performed in the employ of the United States Government or of any instrumentality of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment by Custodian; liability of former owner; enforcement of tax liability; transfer of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Alien Property Custodian shall, notwithstanding the filing of any claim or the institution of any suit under this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39, and 41 to 44 of this Appendix], pay any tax incident to any such property or interest, or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not contrary to the interest of the United States. The former owner shall not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, interest, earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by the Alien Property Custodian, unless they are returned pursuant to this Act [said sections] without payment of such tax by the Alien Property Custodian. Every such tax shall be paid by the Alien Property Custodian to the same extent, as nearly as may be deemed practicable, as though the property or interest had not been vested in or transferred to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be paid only out of the property or interest, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other property or interests acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from any property or interest or the earnings, increment or proceeds thereof while held by the Alien Property Custodian except with his consent.

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Congress further declares that in a free society the obligations and privileges of serving in the armed forces and the reserve components thereof should be shared generally, in accordance with a system of selection which is fair and just, and which is consistent with the maintenance of an effective national economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Congress further declares, in accordance with our traditional military policy as expressed in the National Defense Act of 1916, as amended, that it is essential that the strength and organization of the National Guard, both Ground and Air, as an integral part of the first line defenses of this Nation, be at all times maintained and assured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">To this end, it is the intent of the Congress that whenever Congress shall determine that <!-- PDFPage:60 -->units and organizations are needed for the national security in excess of those of the Regular components of the Ground Forces and the Air Forces, and those in active service under this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], the National Guard of the United States, both Ground and Air, or such part thereof as may be necessary, together with such units of the Reserve components as are necessary for a balanced force, shall be ordered to active Federal service and continued therein so long as such necessity exists.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Congress further declares that adequate provision for national security requires maximum effort in the fields of scientific research and development, and the fullest possible utilization of the Nation's technological, scientific, and other critical manpower resources.</p>

The drawing, commencing with the first day selected and continuing until all 366 days are drawn, shall be accomplished impartially.</p>

No person shall be tried by court martial in any case arising under this title [said sections] unless such person has been actually inducted for the training and service prescribed under this title [said sections] or unless he is subject to trial by court martial under laws in force prior to the enactment of this title [June 24, 1948].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Any person (1) who knowingly transfers or delivers to another, for the purpose of aiding or abetting the making of any false identification or representation, any registration certificate, alien's certificate of nonresidence, or any other certificate issued pursuant to or prescribed by the provisions of this title [sections 451 to 471a of this Appendix], or rules or regulations promulgated hereunder; or (2) who, with intent that it be used for any purpose of false identification or representation, has in his possession any such certificate not duly issued to him; or (3) who forges, alters, knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates, or in any manner changes any such certificate or any notation duly and validly inscribed thereon; or (4) who, with intent that it be used for any purpose of false identification or representation, photographs, prints, or in any manner makes or executes any engraving, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any such certificate, or any colorable imitation thereof; or (5) who has in his possession any certificate purporting to be a certificate issued pursuant to this title [said sections], or rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, which he knows to be falsely made, reproduced, forged, counterfeited, or altered; or (6) who knowingly violates or evades any of the provisions of this title [said sections] or rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto relating to the issuance, transfer, or possession of such certificate, shall, upon conviction, be fined not to exceed $10,000 or be imprisoned for not more than five years, or both. Whenever on trial for a violation of this subsection the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of any certificate not duly issued to him, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to establish an intent to use such certificate for purposes of false identification or representation, unless the defendant explains such possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Department of Justice shall proceed as expeditiously as possible with a prosecution under this section, or with an appeal, upon the request of the Director of Selective Service System or shall advise the House of Representatives and the Senate in writing the reasons for its failure to do so.</p>

Information furnished to the Director by the Secretary under this subsection shall be used only for the purpose of the enforcement of this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Except as provided in subsection (g), any person who is required under section 3 [section 453 of this Appendix] to present himself for and submit to registration under such section and fails to do so in accordance with any proclamation issued under such section, or in accordance with any rule or regulation issued under such section, shall be ineligible for any form of assistance or benefit provided under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to receive any grant, loan, or work assistance under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. [and 42 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.]), a person who is required under section 3 [section 453 of this Appendix] to present himself for and submit to registration under such section shall file with the institution of higher education which the person intends to attend, or is attending, a statement of compliance with section 3 and regulations issued thereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Education, in agreement with the Director, shall prescribe methods for verifying such statements of compliance filed pursuant to paragraph (2). Such methods may include requiring institutions of higher education to provide a list to the Secretary of Education or to the Director of persons who have submitted such statements of compliance.</p>

Such regulations shall also provide that the Secretary may afford such person an opportunity for a hearing to establish his compliance or for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A person may not be denied a right, privilege, or benefit under Federal law by reason of failure to present himself for and submit to registration under section 3 [section 453 of this Appendix] if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the requirement for the person to so register has terminated or become inapplicable to the person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure of the person to register was not a knowing and willful failure to register.</p>

<p class="note-body">The United States withdrew the last of its forces from the Republic of Vietnam on March 28, 1973.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the period of its involvement in armed hostilities in Southeast Asia, the United States suffered great losses. Millions served their country, thousands died in combat, thousands more were wounded, others are still listed as missing in action.</p>
<p class="note-body">Over a year after the last American combatant had left Vietnam, the status of thousands of our countrymen&mdash;convicted, charged, investigated or still sought for violations of the Military Selective Service Act [see References in Text note set out under section 451 of this Appendix] or of the Uniform Code of Military Justice [10 U.S.C. 801 et seq.]&mdash;remains unresolved.</p>
<p class="note-body">In furtherance of our national commitment to justice and mercy these young Americans should have the chance to contribute a share to the rebuilding of peace among ourselves and with all nations. They should be allowed the opportunity to earn return to their country, their communities, and their families, upon their agreement to a period of alternate service in the national interest, together with an acknowledgment of their allegiance to the country and its Constitution.</p>
<p class="note-body">Desertion in time of war is a major, serious offense; failure to respond to the country's call for duty is also a serious offense. Reconciliation among our people does not require that these acts be condoned. Yet, reconciliation calls for an act of mercy to bind the Nation's wounds and to heal the scars of divisiveness.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States, pursuant to my powers under Article II, Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Constitution, do hereby proclaim a program to commence immediately to afford reconciliation to Vietnam era draft evaders and military deserters upon the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. <em>Draft Evaders&mdash;</em>An individual who allegedly unlawfully failed under the Military Selective Service Act [see References in Text note set out under section 451 of this Appendix] or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, to register or register on time, to keep the local board informed of his current address, to report for or submit to preinduction or induction examination, to report for or submit to induction itself, or to report for or submit to, or complete service under section 6(j) of such Act [section 456(j) of this Appendix] during the period from August 4, 1964 to March 28, 1973, inclusive, and who has not been adjudged guilty in a trial for such offense, will be relieved of prosecution and punishment for such offense if he:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) presents himself to a United States Attorney before March 31, 1975,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) executes an agreement acknowledging his allegiance to the United States and pledging to fulfill a period of alternate service under the auspices of the Director of Selective Service, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) satisfactorily completes such service.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The alternate service shall promote the national health, safety, or interest. No draft evader will be given the privilege of completing a period of alternate service by service in the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, this program will not apply to an individual who is precluded from re-entering the United States under 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(22) or other law. Additionally, if individuals eligible for this program have other criminal charges outstanding, their participation in the program may be conditioned upon, or postponed until after, final disposition of the other charges has been reached in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="note-body">The period of service shall be twenty-four months, which may be reduced by the Attorney General because of mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. <em>Military Deserters&mdash;</em>A member of the armed forces who has been administratively classified as a deserter by reason of unauthorized absence and whose absence commenced during the period from August 4, 1964 to March 28, 1973, inclusive, will be relieved of prosecution and punishment under Articles 85, 86 and 87 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice [10 U.S.C. 885, 886, 887] for such absence and for offenses directly related thereto if before March 31, 1975 he takes an oath of allegiance to the United States and executes an agreement with the Secretary of the Military Department from which he absented himself or for members of the Coast Guard, with the Secretary of Transportation, pledging to fulfill a period of alternate service under the auspices of the Director of Selective Service. The alternate service shall promote the national health, safety, or interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">The period of service shall be twenty-four months, which may be reduced by the Secretary of the appropriate Military Department, or Secretary of Transportation for members of the Coast Guard, because of mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, if a member of the armed forces has additional outstanding charges pending against him under the Uniform Code of Military Justice [10 U.S.C. 801 et seq.], his eligibility to participate in this program may be conditioned upon, or postponed until after, final disposition of the additional charges has been reached in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each member of the armed forces who elects to seek relief through this program will receive an undesirable discharge. Thereafter, upon satisfactory completion of a period of alternate service prescribed by the Military Department or Department of Transportation, such individual will be entitled to receive, in lieu of his undesirable discharge, a clemency discharge in recognition of his fulfillment of the requirements of the program. Such clemency discharge shall not bestow entitlement to benefits administered by the Veterans Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Procedures of the Military Departments implementing this Proclamation will be in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary of Defense, present Military Department regulations notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. <em>Presidential Clemency Board&mdash;</em>By Executive Order I have this date established a Presidential Clemency Board which will review the records of individuals within the following categories: (<em>i</em>) those who have been convicted of draft evasion offenses as described above, (<em>ii</em>) those who have received a punitive or undesirable discharge from service in the armed forces for having violated Article 85, 86, or 87 of the Uniform Code of <!-- PDFPage:91 -->Military Justice [10 U.S.C. 885, 886, 887] between August 4, 1964 and March 28, 1973, or are serving sentences of confinement for such violations. Where appropriate, the Board may recommend that clemency be conditioned upon completion of a period of alternate service. However, if any clemency discharge is recommended, such discharge shall not bestow entitlement to benefits administered by the Veterans Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">4. <em>Alternate Service&mdash;</em>In prescribing the length of alternate service in individual cases, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the appropriate Department, or the Clemency Board shall take into account such honorable service as an individual may have rendered prior to his absence, penalties already paid under law, and such other mitigating factors as may be appropriate to seek equity among those who participate in this program.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-nineth.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any action or proceeding commenced in any court, if there shall be a default of any appearance by the defendant, the plaintiff, before entering judgment shall file in the court an affidavit setting forth facts showing that the defendant is not in military service. If unable to file such affidavit plaintiff shall in lieu thereof file an affidavit setting forth either that the defendant is in the military service or that plaintiff is not able to determine whether or not defendant is in such service. If an affidavit is not filed showing that the defendant is not in the military service, no judgment shall be entered without first securing an order of court directing such entry, and no such order shall be made if the defendant is in such service until after the court shall have appointed an attorney to represent defendant and protect his interest, and the court shall on application make such appointment. Unless it appears that the defendant is not in such service the court may require, as a condition before judgment is entered, that the plaintiff file a bond approved by the court conditioned to indemnify the defendant, if in military service, against any loss or damage that he may suffer by reason of any judgment should the judgment be thereafter set aside in whole or in part. And the court may make such other and further order or enter such judgment as in its opinion may be necessary to protect the rights of the defendant under this Act [sections 501 to 593 of this Appendix]. Whenever, under the laws applicable with respect to any court, facts may be evidenced, established, or proved by an unsworn statement, declaration, verification, or certificate, in writing, subscribed and certified or declared to be true under penalty of perjury, the filing of such an unsworn statement, declaration, verification, or certificate shall satisfy the requirement of this subsection that facts be established by affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who shall make or use an affidavit required under this section, or a statement, declaration, verification, or certificate certified or declared to be true under penalty of perjury permitted under subsection (1), knowing it to be false, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by imprisonment not to exceed one year or by fine not to exceed $1,000, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any action or proceeding in which a person in military service is a party if such party does not personally appear therein or is not represented by an authorized attorney, the court may appoint an attorney to represent him; and in such case a like bond may be required and an order made to protect the rights of such person. But no attorney appointed under this Act [sections 501 to 593 of this Appendix], to protect a person in military service shall have power to waive any right of the person for whom he is appointed or bind him by his acts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any judgment shall be rendered in any action or proceeding governed by this section against any person in military service during the period of such service or within thirty days thereafter, and it appears that such person was prejudiced by reason of his military service in <!-- PDFPage:104 -->making his defense thereto, such judgment may, upon application, made by such person or his legal representative, not later than ninety days after the termination of such service, be opened by the court rendering the same and such defendant or his legal representative let in to defend; provided it is made to appear that the defendant has a meritorious or legal defense to the action or some part thereof. Vacating, setting aside, or reversing any judgment because of any of the provisions of this Act [said sections], shall not impair any right or title acquired by any bona fide purchaser for value under such judgment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This section applies to a person who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) after July 31, 1990, is ordered to active duty (other than for training) pursuant to section 672(a) or (g), 673, 673b, 674, 675, or 688&nbsp;<sup><a href="#592_1_target" name="592_1">1</a></sup> of title 10, United States Code, or who is ordered to active duty under section 672(d) of such title during a period when members are on active duty pursuant to any of the preceding sections; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) immediately before receiving the order to active duty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was engaged in the furnishing of health-care services or other services determined by the Secretary of Defense to be professional services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) had in effect a professional liability insurance policy that does not continue to cover claims filed with respect to such person during the period of the person's active duty unless the premiums are paid for such coverage for such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Coverage of a person referred to in subsection (a) by a professional liability insurance policy shall be suspended in accordance with this subsection upon receipt of the written request of such person by the insurance carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A professional liability insurance carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may not require that premiums be paid by or on behalf of a person for any professional liability insurance coverage suspended pursuant to paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall refund any amount paid for coverage for the period of such suspension or, upon the election of such person, apply such amount for the payment of any premium becoming due upon the reinstatement of such coverage.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A professional liability insurance carrier shall not be liable with respect to any claim that is based on professional conduct (including any failure to take any action in a professional capacity) of a person that occurs during a period of suspension of that person's professional liability insurance under this subsection. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a claim based upon the failure of a professional to make adequate provision for patients to be cared for during the period of the professional's active duty service shall be considered to be based on an action or failure to take action before the beginning of the period of suspension of professional liability insurance under this subsection, except in a case in which professional services were provided after the date of the beginning of such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reinstatement of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Professional liability insurance coverage suspended in the case of any person pursuant to subsection (b) shall be reinstated by the insurance carrier on the date on which that person transmits to the insurance carrier a written request for reinstatement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The request of a person for reinstatement shall be effective only if the person transmits the request to the insurance carrier within 30 days after the date on which the person is released from active duty.

Such premium shall be paid by the person within 30 days after the receipt of that notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The period for which professional liability insurance coverage shall be reinstated for a person under this subsection may not be less than the balance of the period for which coverage would have continued under the insurance policy if the coverage had not been suspended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Increase in premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An insurance carrier may not increase the amount of the premium charged for professional liability insurance coverage of any person for the minimum period of the reinstatement of such coverage required under subsection (c)(3) to an amount greater than the amount chargeable for such coverage for such period before the suspension, except to the extent of any general increase in the premium amounts charged by that carrier for the same professional liability coverage for persons similarly covered by such insurance during the period of the suspension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuation of coverage of unaffected persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require a suspension of professional liability insurance coverage for any person who is not a person referred to in subsection (a) and who is covered by the same professional liability insurance as a person referred to in such subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) relieve any person of the obligation to pay premiums for the coverage not required to be suspended.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:120 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Stay of civil or administrative actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A civil or administrative action for damages on the basis of the alleged professional negligence or other professional liability of a person whose professional liability insurance coverage has been suspended under subsection (b) shall be stayed until the end of the period of the suspension if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the action was commenced during that period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the action is based on an act or omission that occurred before the date on which the suspension became effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the suspended professional liability insurance would, except for the suspension, on its face cover the alleged professional negligence or other professional liability negligence or other professional liability of the person.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a civil or administrative action for damages is stayed under paragraph (1) in the case of any person, the action shall be deemed to have been filed on the date on which the professional liability insurance coverage of such person is reinstated under subsection (c).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect of suspension upon limitations period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a civil or administrative action for which a stay could have been granted under subsection (f) by reason of the suspension of professional liability insurance coverage of the defendant under this section, the period of the suspension of the coverage shall be excluded from the computation of any statutory period of limitation on the commencement of such action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Death during period of suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a person whose professional liability insurance coverage is suspended under subsection (b) dies during the period of the suspension&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the requirement for the grant or continuance of a stay in any civil or administrative action against such person under subsection (f)(1) shall terminate on the date of the death of such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the carrier of the professional liability insurance so suspended shall be liable for any claim for damages for professional negligence or other professional liability of the deceased person in the same manner and to the same extent as such carrier would be liable if the person had died while covered by such insurance but before the claim was filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 101 of title 10, United States Code.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 806, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;1, 56 Stat. 463, suspended the provisions of existing law relating to periodic computations for the purpose of determining the authorized number of commissioned officers in the various grades of the line of the Regular Navy and of the Marine Corps, the permanent promotion or advancement of all officers of the Navy and Marine Corps, and the involuntary retirement or honorable discharge of such officers by reason of failure of selection or upon completion of designated periods of service. Under section 813 of this Appendix, this section also applied to officer personnel of the Coast Guard. This section was repealed insofar as it related to the Navy and Marine Corps by act Aug. 7, 1947, ch. 512, title IV, &sect;426(a), 61 Stat. 880. It was superseded with respect to the Coast Guard by section 42 of Title 14, Coast Guard.</p>

Sections 350j and 350k of former Title 34 were repealed by act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;53, 70A Stat. 641, and replaced by sections 5597 and 5787 of Title 10, Armed Forces, section 351 of Title 14, Coast Guard, and section 212(f) of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.</p>

As pointed out in notes under sections 806, 807, 810, and 812, they have been superseded with respect to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 814, act June 30, 1942, ch. 462, &sect;9, 56 Stat. 465, prohibited any reduction of pay by virtue of sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix, and provided for termination of sections 806 to 814 of this Appendix on June 30 of fiscal year following that in which World War II ended. See Termination of State of War notes preceding section 1, of this Appendix.

Such seamen, because of the temporary wartime character of their employment by the War Shipping Administration, shall not be considered as officers or employees of the United States for the purposes of the United States Employees Compensation Act, as amended [5 U.S.C. 8101 et seq.]; the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended [5 U.S.C. 8331 et seq.]; the Act of Congress approved March 7, 1942 (Pub.

Rights of any seaman under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], as amended by subsection (b)(2) and (3), and claims therefor shall be governed solely by the provisions of such Act, so amended. When used in this subsection the term &ldquo;administratively disallowed&rdquo; means a denial of a written claim in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Administrator, War Shipping Administration. When used in this subsection the terms &ldquo;War Shipping Administration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Administrator, War Shipping Administration&rdquo; shall be deemed to include the United States Maritime Commission with respect to the period beginning October 1, 1941, and ending February 11, 1942, and the term &ldquo;seaman&rdquo; shall be deemed to include any seaman employed as an employee of the United States through the War Shipping Administration on vessels made available to or subchartered to other agencies or departments of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of sections 708, 709, 710, 712, and 713 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [46 App. U.S.C. 1198 to 1200, 1202, 1203], shall be applicable to charters made under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11 and 14 of this Act, as amended [sections 1744 and 1735 note of this Appendix], war-built dry-cargo vessels owned by the United States on or after June 30, 1950, may be chartered pursuant to this Act [sections 1735 to 1746 of this Appendix] for bareboat use in any service which, in the opinion of the Maritime Administration, is required in the public interest and is not adequately served, and for which privately owned American flag vessels are not available for charter by private operators on reasonable conditions and at reasonable rates for use in such service. No charters shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation under authority of this subsection until the Maritime Administration shall have given due notice to all interested parties and shall have afforded such parties an op<!-- PDFPage:151 -->portunity for a public hearing on such charters and shall have certified its findings to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to include in such charters such restrictions and conditions as the Maritime Administration determines to be necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest in respect of such charters and to protect privately owned vessels against competition from vessels chartered under this section: <em>Provided, however</em>, That all such charters shall contain a provision that they will be reviewed annually by the Maritime Administration, with recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation, for the purpose of determining whether conditions exist justifying continuance of the charters under the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A charter existing on June 30, 1950, with respect to a war-built dry-cargo vessel may be extended to October 31, 1950, if application is made within ten days after the enactment hereof [June 30, 1950] for the charter of such vessel under this subsection and if the Secretary of Transportation deems such extension is justified in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection: <em>Provided, however</em>, That a new voyage under such extended charter shall not be begun after October 31, 1950, unless it has been determined prior to such date, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this subsection, that the continued use of the vessel in the service is required. The Maritime Administration shall conduct all hearings on applications made under this paragraph immediately upon receipt thereof and shall promptly certify its findings to the Secretary of Transportation, provided that all such certifications shall be made not later than October 31, 1950.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Charter of passenger vessels</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Charters existing on June 30, 1950, with respect to passenger vessels may be continued until December 31, 1951, or until expiration thereof by the terms of their provisions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Invitation of purchase proposals; notice and advertisement; period for receipt of proposals; data to accompany proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall invite, upon adequate notice and advertisement, proposals for the purchase of the Government-owned rubber-producing facilities, hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;facilities&rdquo;. The period for the receipt of proposals shall be determined and publicly announced by the Commission, and in no event shall be less than six months after the first day on which proposals may be received pursuant to the advertisement. The advertisement shall be in such form, contain such specifications and reservations, and be published in such manner as the Commission in its discretion determines will best effectuate the purposes of this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix]. All data concerning such facilities which in the judgment of the Commission may be reasonably required for the submission of a bona fide proposal shall be furnished by the Commission upon request by any prospective purchaser unless the Commission has reason to believe that such prospective purchaser has not identified his principal, or is not financially responsible, or is a poor security risk.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Form and contents of proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Proposals shall be in writing, and shall contain, among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identification of the person in whose behalf the proposal is submitted, including the business affiliation of such person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facility or facilities which are proposed to be purchased, and the order of preference if more than one facility is proposed to be purchased; or the order of preference if proposals are submitted on more than one facility, if only one facility is proposed to be purchased;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the arrangements or plans, if any, formal or informal, for the supply of feedstock to, and the disposition of the end products of, the respective facilities proposed to be purchased;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the amount proposed to be paid for each of the facilities, and, if such amount is not to be paid in cash, then the principal terms of the financing arrangement proposed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the general terms and conditions which the prospective purchaser of a copolymer facility would be willing to accept in order to make the end product of such facility available for sale to small business enterprises, and the general terms and conditions which the prospective purchaser of a butadiene or styrene facility would be willing to accept in order to make the end product of such facility available for sale to purchasers of copolymer facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such other information as the Commission in its notice and advertisement for proposals shall require be set forth in proposals including the prospective purchaser's acceptance of the terms, conditions, restrictions and reservations contained in subsection (h) of this section, and the interest rate to be charged on the purchase-money mortgage referred to in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclosure of contents of proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Should it become necessary to the effective prosecution of the disposal program, the Commission may, after the termination of the period for the submission of proposals provided for in subsection (a) of this section, disclose the contents of the proposals at such time, in such manner, and to such extent as it deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deposit of cash or Government bonds to accompany proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Proposals shall be accompanied by a deposit of cash or United States Government bonds of face amount equal to 21/2 per centum of the gross amount proposed to be paid but not exceeding $250,000 for each facility: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the deposit required in the case of a proposal for one of a number of facilities on an alternative basis shall be the same as would be required if such proposal were for only the facility for which the particular prospective purchaser pro<!-- PDFPage:171 -->posed to pay the highest amount. Except in the case of purchasers, deposits made hereunder shall be refunded without interest and not later than upon the termination of the period for congressional review as provided in section 9 of this Act [section 1941g of this Appendix]. In the case of purchasers, deposits made hereunder shall be applied without interest to the purchase price: <em>Provided, however</em>, That upon the closing of the contract of sale the purchaser shall be required to substitute cash equal to the face amount of the Government bonds then held in connection with such purchaser's proposal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of purchase price; amount and terms of mortgages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payment of the purchase price may be made in part by a first lien purchase-money mortgage, in an amount not to exceed 75 per centum of the purchase price. The terms of any such mortgage obligation, to be determined by negotiation, shall provide among other things for a maturity of not more than ten years, periodic amortization, and a uniform interest rate of not less than 3 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Negotiation with those submitting proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Promptly after the termination of the period for the receipt of proposals, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and for such period thereafter not less than seven months as may be determined and publicly announced by the Commission, it shall negotiate with those submitting proposals for the purpose of entering into definitive contracts of sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Securing of additional information from those submitting proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix] shall be construed to prevent the Commission from securing such additional information from those submitting proposals at any time as the Commission may deem necessary or appropriate to fulfill its responsibilities under this Act [said sections].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) National security clause in contracts of sale</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All contracts of sale and instruments in execution thereof shall contain a national security clause having terms, conditions, restrictions and reservations which will assure the prompt availability of the rubber-producing facilities, or facilities of equivalent capacity, for the production of synthetic rubber and the component materials thereof for a period of ten years from the date of the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Effective date of contracts of sale; time for transfer of possession of facilities; failure to complete transfer prior to termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the conditions prescribed in section 24 of this Act [section 1941v of this Appendix], any contract of sale shall become fully effective upon the expiration of the period for congressional review provided for in section 9 of this Act [section 1941g of this Appendix] unless the Congress within such period has disapproved such sale. The transfer of possession of all of the rubber-producing facilities to be sold shall be made as promptly as is practicable after the effective date, in accordance with the terms of the contracts, but in any event within a period terminating sixty days after the expiration of the period for congressional review as provided in section 9(b) of this Act [section 1941g(b) of this Appendix]. The failure to complete transfer of possession prior to said termination date shall not give rise to or be the basis of rescission of the contract of sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Limitation on Government rubber sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon termination of the transfer period, as provided in subsection (i) of this section, the operating agency last designated by the President shall make no further sales of synthetic rubber and its component materials except as otherwise provided in this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Offer of Government rubber for sale to purchasers of facilities after termination of transfer period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the period of one year following the termination of the transfer period, the operating agency last designated by the President shall offer for sale to the purchasers of the facilities the synthetic rubber and its component materials held by it at a price determined in accordance with its pricing policy prevailing at the close of the transfer period, in amounts prorated in accordance with the ratio of the capacity of each such facility purchased to the total capacity of all facilities of the same type sold. Any synthetic rubber or component materials not purchased by an eligible purchaser during periodic intervals, as determined by the operating agency, shall be made available to other eligible purchasers on a like equitable basis. Any synthetic rubber or component materials not sold during such one-year period shall thereafter be disposed of in such manner as said agency deems advisable.</p>

At any time after the termination of production, such facilities may be transferred without reimbursement or transfer of funds to the General Services Administration and administered in accordance <!-- PDFPage:172 -->with the provisions of sections 6, 7, and 8 of the National Industrial Reserve Act of 1948, as amended (62 Stat. 1227, 50 U.S.C. 456&ndash;458) [50 U.S.C. 455 to 457], or to such other agency as the President may designate for administration in such manner as he may direct. In such event (1) no such facility shall thereafter be operated as a rubber-producing facility for the account of, or by, the Government except pursuant to further Act of Congress; (2) no such facility, other than alcohol-butadiene facilities, shall be leased for operation as a rubber-producing facility at any time: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing contained in this Act [sections 1941 to 1941y of this Appendix] shall preclude the leasing of alcohol-butadiene facilities for purposes other than the manufacture of alcohol butadiene so long as such leases are in accordance with the provisions of section 8(a) or section 9(f) of this Act [subsection (a) of this section or section 1941g (f) of this Appendix]; and (3) no such facility shall be disposed of by sale within a period of three years from the termination of the transfer period, and in any subsequent lease or sale, the Government agency acting under authority of this section shall within a reasonable time and in no event less than sixty days prior to the lease or sale, request the advice of the Attorney General as to whether the proposed lease or sale would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. The Attorney General shall give his advice within forty-five days of the receipt of such request. Upon the request of the Attorney General, the Government agency shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, such information as it may possess which the Attorney General determines to be appropriate or necessary to enable him to give the advice called for by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Whenever any transfer to any Government agency is made pursuant to this section, all unexpended funds budgeted as provided in section 9(e) [section 1941g(e) of this Appendix] for standby and maintenance in such condition shall also be transferred.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) With regard to individuals of Japanese ancestry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that, as described by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry by the evacuation, relocation, and internment of civilians during World War II. As the Commission documents, these actions were carried out without adequate security reasons and without any acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the Commission, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. The excluded individuals of Japanese ancestry suffered enormous damages, both material and intangible, and there were incalculable losses in education and job training, all of which resulted in significant human suffering for which appropriate compensation has not been made. For these fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights of these individuals of Japanese ancestry, the Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) With respect to the Aleuts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that, as described by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, the Aleut civilian residents of the Pribilof Islands and the Aleutian Islands west of Unimak Island were relocated during World War II to temporary camps in isolated regions of southeast Alaska where they remained, under United States control and in the care of the United States, until long after any potential danger to their home villages had passed. The United States failed to provide reasonable care for the Aleuts, and this resulted in widespread illness, disease, and death among the residents of the camps; and the United States further failed to protect Aleut personal and community property while such property was in its possession or under its control. The United States has not compensated the Aleuts adequately for the conversion or destruction of personal property, and the conversion or destruction of community property caused by the United States military occupation of Aleut villages during World War II. There is no remedy for injustices suffered by the Aleuts during World War II except an Act of Congress providing appropriate compensation for those losses which are attributable to the conduct of United States forces and other officials and employees of the United States.</p>

The Commission may, with the consent of the head of any other department or agency of the Government, utilize the facilities and services of such department or agency in carrying out the functions of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules and regulations; delegation of functions; time limit on filing of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to enable it to carry out its functions, and may delegate functions to any member, officer, or employee of the Commission.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subpenas; issuance; contempt; witness fees; administration of oaths</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of any hearing, examination, or investigation under this title [sections 2001 to 2016 of this Appendix], the Commission and those employees designated by the Commission shall have the power to issue subpenas requiring persons to appear and testify or to appear and produce documents, or both, at any designated place where such hearing, examination, or investigation is being held. The Commission or any employee so designated shall, upon application of a claimant, issue to such claimant subpenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of documents, or both, required by such claimant in hearings upon his claim: <em>Provided</em>, That the claimant making such application pay the witness fees and mileage of any witness or witnesses subpenaed upon his request. The production of a person's documents at any place other than his place of business shall not be required, however, in any case in which, prior to the return date specified in the subpena with respect thereto, such person either has furnished the issuer of the subpena with a copy of such documents (certified by such person under oath to be a true and correct copy) or has entered into a stipulation with the issuer of the subpena as to the information contained in such documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission may, in case of a failure or refusal on the part of any person to comply with any such subpena, invoke the aid of any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which the hearing, examination, or investigation is being conducted, or such person resides or transacts business. Such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear at the designated place of hearing, examination, or investigation, there to give or produce testimony or documentary evidence concerning the matter in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court shall be punishable by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district wherein such person resides or transacts business or wherever such person may be found.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Witnesses subpenaed under this subsection shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are allowed and paid witnesses in United States district courts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payment in full of awards made pursuant to section 202(d)(1) and (2) [section 2017a(d)(1) and (2) of this Appendix], and thereafter of any award made pursuant to section 202(a) [section 2017a(a) of this Appendix] to any claimant (A) certified to the Commission by the Small Business Administration as having been, on the date of loss, damage, or destruction, a small business concern within the meaning now set forth in the Small Business Act, as amended [15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.], or (B) determined by the Commission to have been, on the date of loss, damage, or destruction, a nonprofit organization operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, religious, charitable, or educational purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the other awards made pursuant to section 202 [section 2017a of this Appendix] in an amount which shall be the same for each award or in the amount of the award, whichever is less. The total payment made pursuant to this paragraph on account of any award shall not exceed $10,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the other awards made to individuals and corporations pursuant to section 202 [section 2017a of this Appendix] and not compensated in full under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection in an amount which shall be the same for each award or in the amount of the award, whichever is less. The total payment pursuant to this paragraph on account of any award shall not exceed $35,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Thereafter, payments from time to time on account of the unpaid balance of each remaining award made pursuant to section 202 [section 2017a of this Appendix] or recertified pursuant to subsection (b) of section 209 [section 2017h of this Appendix] which shall bear to such unpaid balance the same proportion as the total amount in the War Claims Fund and available for distribution at the time such payments are made bears to the aggregate unpaid balances of all such awards. No payment made pursuant to this paragraph on account of any award shall exceed the unpaid balance of such award. Payments heretofore made under section 310 of title III of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, as amended [22 U.S.C. 1641i], on awards made against the Government of Hungary under section 303(1) of title III of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, as amended [22 U.S.C. 1641b(1)], and recertified under subsection (b) of section 209 [section 2017h(b) of this Appendix], shall be considered as payments under this paragraph and no payment shall be made on any recertified award until the percentage of distribution on awards made under section 202 [section 2017a of this Appendix] exceeds the corresponding percentage of distribution on such recertified award: <em>Provided</em>, That no payment made on awards recertified under subsection (b) of section 209 [section 2017h(b) of this Appendix] shall exceed 40 per centum of the amount of the award recertified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Such payments, and applications for such payments, shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) For the purpose of making any such payments, other than under section 213(a)(1) [subsec. (a)(1) of this section], an &ldquo;award&rdquo; shall be deemed to mean the aggregate of all awards certified for payment in favor of the same claimant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If any person to whom any payment is to be made pursuant to this title [sections 2017 to 2017p of this Appendix] is deceased or is under a legal disability, payment shall be made to his legal representative, except that if any payment to be made is not over $1,000 and there is no qualified executor or administrator, payment may be made to the person or persons found by the Comptroller General to be entitled thereto, without the necessity of compliance with the requirements of law with respect to the administration of estates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Payment on account of any award pursuant to this title [sections 2017 to 2017p of this Appendix] shall not, unless such payment is for the full amount of the award, extinguish any rights against any foreign government for the unpaid balance of the award.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Payments made under this section on account of any award for loss, damage, or destruction occurring in the Commonwealth of the Philippines shall not exceed the amount paid on account of awards in the same amount under the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 [sections 1751 to 1806 of this Appendix].</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the vitality of the industrial and technology base of the United States is a foundation of national security that provides the industrial and technological capabilities employed to meet national defense requirements, in peacetime and in time of national emergency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in peacetime, the health of the industrial and technological base contributes to the technological superiority of United States defense equipment, which is a cornerstone of the national security strategy, and the efficiency with which defense equipment is developed and produced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in times of crisis, a healthy industrial base will be able to effectively provide the graduated response needed to effectively meet the demands of the emergency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in view of continuing international problems, the Nation's demonstrated reliance on imports of materials and components, and the need for measures to reduce defense production lead times and bottlenecks, and in order to provide for the national defense and national security, the United States defense mobilization preparedness effort continues to require the development of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) preparedness programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) domestic defense industrial base improvement measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provisions for a graduated response to any threatening international or military situation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the expansion of domestic productive capacity beyond the levels needed to meet the civilian demand; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) some diversion of certain materials and facilities from civilian use to military and related purposes.<sup><a href="#2062_1_target" name="2062_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to meet the requirements referred to in this subsection, this Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix] affords to the President an array of authorities to shape defense preparedness programs and to take appropriate steps to maintain and enhance the defense industrial and technological base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the activities referred to in this subsection are needed in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) improve domestic defense industrial base efficiency and responsiveness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduce the time required for industrial mobilization in the event of an attack on the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to respond to actions occurring outside of the United States which could result in the termination or reduction of the availability of strategic and critical materials, including energy, and which could adversely affect the national defense preparedness of the United States;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in order to ensure national defense preparedness, which is essential to national security, it is necessary and appropriate to assure the availability of domestic energy supplies for national defense needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to further assure the adequate maintenance of the defense industrial base, to the maximum extent possible, such supplies should be augmented through reliance on renewable fuels, including solar, geothermal, and wind energy and ethanol and its derivatives, and on energy conservation measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the domestic defense industrial base is a component part of the core industrial capacity of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) much of the industrial capacity which is relied upon by the Federal Government for military production and other defense-related purposes is deeply and directly influenced by&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:227 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the overall competitiveness of the United States industrial economy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the ability of United States industry, in general, to produce internationally competitive products and operate profitably while maintaining adequate research and development to preserve that competitive edge in the future, with respect to military and civilian production;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) the domestic defense industrial base is developing a growing dependency on foreign sources for critical components and materials used in manufacturing and assembling major weapons systems for the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) such dependence is threatening the capability of many critical industries to respond rapidly to defense production needs in the event of war or other hostilities or diplomatic confrontation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the inability of United States industry, especially smaller subcontractors and suppliers, to provide vital parts and components and other materials would impair our ability to sustain United States Armed Forces in combat for longer than a short period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in order to ensure productive capacity in the event of an attack on the United States, the United States should encourage the geographic dispersal of industrial facilities in the United States to discourage the concentration of such productive facilities within limited geographic areas which are vulnerable to attack by an enemy of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to ensure that essential mobilization requirements are met, consideration should also be given to stockpiling strategic materials to the extent that such stockpiling is economical and feasible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the construction of any Government-owned industrial facility, in the rendition of any Government financial assistance for the construction, expansion, or improvement of any industrial facility, and in the production of goods and services, under this or any other Act, each department and agency of the executive branch should apply, under the coordination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when practicable and consistent with existing law and the desirability for maintaining a sound economy, the principle of the geographic dispersal of such facilities in the interest of national defense, except that nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the use of existing industrial facilities;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose of loans; guaranteeing agencies; Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to expedite production and deliveries or services under Government contracts, the President may authorize, subject to such regulations as he may prescribe, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and such other agencies of the United States engaged in procurement for the national defense as he may designate (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;guaranteeing agencies&rdquo;), without regard to provisions of law relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts, to guarantee in whole or in part any public or private financing institution (including any Federal Reserve bank), by commitment to purchase, agreement to share losses, or otherwise, against loss of principal or interest on any loan, discount, or advance, or on any commitment in connection therewith, which may be made by such financing institution for the purpose of financing any contractor, subcontractor, or other person in connection with the performance of any contract or other operation deemed by the guaranteeing agency to be necessary to expedite or expand production and deliveries or services under Government contracts for the procurement of industrial resources or critical technology items essential to the national defense, or for the purpose of financing any contractor, subcontractor, or other person in connection with or in contemplation of the termination, in the interest of the United States, of any contract made for the national defense; but no small-business concern (as defined in section 714(a)(1) of this Act [former section 2163a(a)(1) of this Appendix]) shall be held ineligible for the issuance of such a guaranty by reason of alternative sources of supply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in section 305 [section 2095 of this Appendix] and section 306 [section 2096 of this Appendix], no authority contained in sections 301, 302, or 303 [sections 2091, 2092, or 2093 of this Appendix] may be used in any manner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the development, production, or distribution of synthetic fuel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for any synthetic fuel project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to assist any person for the purpose of providing goods or services to a synthetic fuel project; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President, a guarantee may be entered into under this section only if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the guaranteed contract or activity is for industrial resources or a critical technology item which is essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) without the guarantee, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the needed industrial resources or critical technology item in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the guarantee is the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative for meeting the need involved; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:229 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fiscal agents; accountability; reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal agency or any Federal Reserve bank, when designated by the President, is authorized to act, on behalf of any guaranteeing agency, as fiscal agent of the United States in the making of such contracts of guarantee and in otherwise carrying out the purposes of this section. All such funds as may be necessary to enable any such fiscal agent to carry out any guarantee made by it on behalf of any guaranteeing agency shall be supplied and disbursed by or under authority from such guaranteeing agency. No such fiscal agent shall have any responsibility or accountability except as agent in taking any action pursuant to or under authority of the provisions of this section. Each such fiscal agent shall be reimbursed by each guaranteeing agency for all expenses and losses incurred by such fiscal agent in acting as agent on behalf of such guaranteeing agency, including among such expenses, notwithstanding any other provision of law, attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses of litigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Supervision; interest, fees, procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All actions and operations of such fiscal agents under authority of or pursuant to this section shall be subject to the supervision of the President, and to such regulations as he may prescribe; and the President is authorized to prescribe, either specifically or by maximum limits or otherwise, rates of interest, guarantee and commitment fees, and other charges which may be made in connection with loans, discounts, advances, or commitments guaranteed by the guaranteeing agencies through such fiscal agents, and to prescribe regulations governing the forms and procedures (which shall be uniform to the extent practicable) to be utilized in connection with such guarantees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funds available for guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each guaranteeing agency is authorized to use for the purposes of this section any funds which have heretofore been appropriated or allocated or which hereafter may be appropriated or allocated to it, or which are or may become available to it, for such purposes or for the purpose of meeting the necessities of the national defense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Identification of industrial resource shortfall; prevention of personal financial insolvency or bankruptcy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), a guarantee may be made under this section only if the industrial resource shortfall which such guarantee is intended to correct has been identified in the Budget of the United States, or amendments thereto, submitted to the Congress, accompanied by a statement from the President demonstrating that the budget submission is in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any such guarantee may be made only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource shortfall has been identified pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the making of any guarantee or guarantees to correct an industrial resource shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all guarantees for such industrial resource shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such guarantee or guarantees may be made only if specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority conferred by this section shall not be used primarily to prevent the financial insolvency or bankruptcy of any person, unless</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the President certifies that the insolvency or bankruptcy would have a direct and substantially adverse effect upon defense production; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a copy of such certification, together with a detailed justification thereof, is transmitted to the Congress and to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives at least ten days prior to the exercise of that authority for such use.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To expedite production and deliveries or services to aid in carrying out Government contracts for the procurement of industrial resources or a critical technology item for the national defense, the President may make provision for loans (including participations in, or guarantees of, loan) to private business enterprises (including research corporations not organized for profit) for the expansion of capacity, the development of technological processes, or the production of essential materials, including the exploration, development, and mining of strategic and critical metals and minerals, and manufacture of newsprint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions; Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such loans may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law and on such terms and conditions as the President deems necessary, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) financial assistance may be extended only to the extent that it is not otherwise available on reasonable terms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President, no such loan may be made unless the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the loan is for the expansion of capacity, the development of a technological process, or the production of materials essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without the loan, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the needed capacity, technological processes, or materials in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the loan is the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the loan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Identification of industrial resource shortfall</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (4), no loans may be made under this section, unless <!-- PDFPage:231 -->the industrial resource shortfall which such loan is intended to correct has been identified in the Budget of the United States, or amendments thereto, submitted to the Congress, accompanied by a statement from the President demonstrating that the budget submission is in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such loan may be made only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource shortfall has been identified pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the making of any loan or loans to correct an industrial resource shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all loans for such industrial resource shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such loan or loans may be made only if specifically authorized by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To assist in carrying out the objectives of this Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix], the President may make provision&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for purchases of or commitments to purchase an industrial resource or a critical technology item, for Government use or resale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for the encouragement of exploration, development, and mining of critical and strategic materials, and other materials.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of certain agricultural commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Purchases for resale under this subsection shall not include that part of the supply of an <!-- PDFPage:232 -->agricultural commodity which is domestically produced, except to the extent that such domestically produced supply may be purchased for resale for industrial use or stockpiling.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No commodity purchased under this subsection shall be sold at less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the established ceiling price for such commodity, except that minerals, metals, and materials shall not be sold at less than the established ceiling price, or the current domestic market price, whichever is lower; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if no ceiling price has been established, the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the current domestic market price for such commodity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the minimum sale price established for agricultural commodities owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation, as provided in section 407 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1427].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Delivery dates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No purchase or commitment to purchase any imported agricultural commodity shall specify a delivery date which is more than 1 year after the expiration of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Presidential determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President may not execute a contract under this subsection unless the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the industrial resource or critical technology item is essential to the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) without Presidential action under the authority provided for in this section, United States industry cannot reasonably be expected to provide the capability for the needed industrial resource or critical technology item in a timely manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to this section are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the combination of the United States national defense demand and foreseeable nondefense demand for the industrial resource or critical technology item is not less than the output of domestic industrial capability, as determined by the President, including the output to be established through the purchase, purchase commitment, or other action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Identification of shortfall</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (7), the President shall take no action under this section unless the industrial resource shortfall which such action is intended to correct has been identified in the Budget of the United States, or amendments thereto, submitted to the Congress and accompanied by a statement from the President demonstrating that the budget submission is in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Timing of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any such action may be taken only after 60 days have elapsed after such industrial resource shortfall has been identified pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the taking of any action or actions under this section to correct an industrial resource shortfall would cause the aggregate outstanding amount of all such actions for such industrial resource shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, any such action or actions may be taken only if specifically authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) may be waived&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during periods of national emergency declared by the Congress or the President; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) upon a determination by the President, on a nondelegable basis, that a specific guarantee is necessary to avert an industrial resource or critical technology shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions of purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations in subsection (a) of this section, purchases and commitments to purchase and sales under such subsection may be made without regard to the limitations of existing law, for such quantities, and on such terms and conditions, including advance payments, and for such periods, but not extending beyond a date that is not more than 10 years from the date such purchase, purchase commitment, or sale was initially made, as the President deems necessary, except that purchases or commitments to purchase involving higher than established ceiling prices (or if there be no established ceiling prices, currently prevailing market prices) or anticipated loss on resale shall not be made unless it is determined that supply of the materials could not be effectively increased at lower prices or on terms more favorable to the Government or that such purchases are necessary to assure the availability to the United States of overseas supplies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subsidy payments on domestically produced materials; exclusion of agricultural products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that under generally fair and equitable ceiling prices for any raw or nonprocessed material, there will result a decrease in supplies from high-costs sources of such material, and that the continuation of such supplies is necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that an increase in cost of transportation is temporary in character and threatens to impair maximum production or supply in any area at stable prices of any materials;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">he may make provision for subsidy payments on any such domestically produced material other than an agricultural commodity in such amounts and in such manner (including purchases of such material and its resale at a loss without regard to the limitations of existing law), and on such terms and conditions, as he determines to be necessary to insure that supplies from such high-cost sources are continued, or that maximum production or supply in such <!-- PDFPage:233 -->area at stable prices of such materials is maintained, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transportation, storage, and processing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procurement power granted to the President by this section shall include the power to transport and store and have processed and refined, any materials procured under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Installation of equipment in industrial facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in his judgment it will aid the national defense, the President is authorized to install additional equipment, facilities, processes or improvements to plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by the United States Government, and to install government-owned equipment in plants, factories, and other industrial facilities owned by private persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of excess materials to national stockpile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, metals, minerals, and materials acquired pursuant to the provisions of this section which, in the judgment of the President, are excess to the needs of programs under this Act [sections 2061 to 2171 of this Appendix], shall be transferred to the National Defense Stockpile established by the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.), when the President deems such action to be in the public interest. Transfers made pursuant to this subsection shall be made without charge against or reimbursement from funds appropriated for the purposes of such Act, except that costs incident to such transfer other than acquisition costs shall be paid or reimbursed from such funds, and the acquisition costs of such metals, minerals, and materials transferred shall be deemed to be net losses incurred by the transferring agency and the notes payable issued to the Secretary of the Treasury representing the amounts thereof shall be canceled. Upon the cancellation of any such notes the aggregate amount of borrowing which may be outstanding at any one time under section 304(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2093_1_target" name="2093_1">1</a></sup> of this Act, as amended [section 2094(b) of this Appendix], shall be reduced in an amount equal to the amount of any notes so canceled.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Development of substitutes for strategic and critical materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in his judgment it will aid the national defense, the President may make provision for the development of substitutes for strategic and critical materials, critical components, critical technology items, and other industrial resources.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2401. Congressional findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The ability of United States citizens to engage in international commerce is a fundamental concern of United States policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Exports contribute significantly to the economic well-being of the United States and the stability of the world economy by increasing employment and production in the United States, and by earning foreign exchange, thereby contributing favorably to the trade balance. The restriction of exports from the United States can have serious adverse effects on the balance of payments and on domestic employment, particularly when restrictions applied by the United States are more extensive than those imposed by other countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) It is important for the national interest of the United States that both the private sector and the Federal Government place a high priority on exports, consistent with the economic, security, and foreign policy objectives of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The availability of certain materials at home and abroad varies so that the quantity and composition of United States exports and their distribution among importing countries may affect the welfare of the domestic economy and may have an important bearing upon fulfillment of the foreign policy of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Exports of goods or technology without regard to whether they make a significant contribution to the military potential of individual countries or combinations of countries may adversely affect the national security of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Uncertainty of export control policy can inhibit the efforts of United States business and work to the detriment of the overall attempt to improve the trade balance of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Unreasonable restrictions on access to world supplies can cause worldwide political and economic instability, interfere with free international trade, and retard the growth and development of nations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) It is important that the administration of export controls imposed for national security purposes give special emphasis to the need to control exports of technology (and goods which contribute significantly to the transfer of such technology) which could make a significant contribution to the military potential of any country or combination of countries which would be detrimental to the national security of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Minimization of restrictions on exports of agricultural commodities and products is of critical importance to the maintenance of a sound agricultural sector, to a positive contribution to the balance of payments, to reducing the level of Federal expenditures for agricultural support programs, and to United States cooperation in efforts to eliminate malnutrition and world hunger.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) It is important that the administration of export controls imposed for foreign policy purposes give special emphasis to the need to control exports of goods and substances hazardous to the public health and the environment which are banned or severely restricted for use in the United States, and which, if ex<!-- PDFPage:283 -->ported, could affect the international reputation of the United States as a responsible trading partner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Availability to controlled countries of goods and technology from foreign sources is a fundamental concern of the United States and should be eliminated through negotiations and other appropriate means whenever possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Excessive dependence of the United States, its allies, or countries sharing common strategic objectives with the United States, on energy and other critical resources from potential adversaries can be harmful to the mutual and individual security of all those countries.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2402. Congressional declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following declarations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the policy of the United States to minimize uncertainties in export control policy and to encourage trade with all countries with which the United States has diplomatic or trading relations, except those countries with which such trade has been determined by the President to be against the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is the policy of the United States to use export controls only after full consideration of the impact on the economy of the United States and only to the extent necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to restrict the export of goods and technology which would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any other country or combination of countries which would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to restrict the export of goods and technology where necessary to further significantly the foreign policy of the United States or to fulfill its declared international obligations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to restrict the export of goods where necessary to protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of foreign demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) It is the policy of the United States (A) to apply any necessary controls to the maxi<!-- PDFPage:285 -->mum extent possible in cooperation with all nations, and (B) to encourage observance of a uniform export control policy by all nations with which the United States has defense treaty commitments or common strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is the policy of the United States to use its economic resources and trade potential to further the sound growth and stability of its economy as well as to further its national security and foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to oppose restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries friendly to the United States or against any United States person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to encourage and, in specified cases, require United States persons engaged in the export of goods or technology or other information to refuse to take actions, including furnishing information or entering into or implementing agreements, which have the effect of furthering or supporting the restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by any foreign country against a country friendly to the United States or against any United States person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to foster international cooperation and the development of international rules and institutions to assure reasonable access to world supplies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) It is the policy of the United States that the desirability of subjecting, or continuing to subject, particular goods or technology or other information to United States export controls should be subjected to review by and consultation with representatives of appropriate United States Government agencies and private industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) It is the policy of the United States to use export controls, including license fees, to secure the removal by foreign countries of restrictions on access to supplies where such restrictions have or may have a serious domestic inflationary impact, have caused or may cause a serious domestic shortage, or have been imposed for purposes of influencing the foreign policy of the United States. In effecting this policy, the President shall make reasonable and prompt efforts to secure the removal or reduction of such restrictions, policies, or actions through international cooperation and agreement before imposing export controls. No action taken in fulfillment of the policy set forth in this paragraph shall apply to the export of medicine or medical supplies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) It is the policy of the United States to use export controls to encourage other countries to take immediate steps to prevent the use of their territories or resources to aid, encourage, or give sanctuary to those persons involved in directing, supporting, or participating in acts of international terrorism. To achieve this objective, the President shall make reasonable and prompt efforts to secure the removal or reduction of such assistance to international terrorists through international cooperation and agreement before imposing export controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) It is the policy of the United States to cooperate with other countries with which the United States has defense treaty commitments or common strategic objectives in restricting the export of goods and technology which would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any country or combination of countries which would prove detrimental to the security of the United States and of those countries with which the United States has defense treaty commitments or common strategic objectives, and to encourage other friendly countries to cooperate in restricting the sale of goods and technology that can harm the security of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) It is the policy of the United States that export trade by United States citizens be given a high priority and not be controlled except when such controls (A) are necessary to further fundamental national security, foreign policy, or short supply objectives, (B) will clearly further such objectives, and (C) are administered consistent with basic standards of due process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) It is the policy of the United States to minimize restrictions on the export of agricultural commodities and products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) It is the policy of the United States to sustain vigorous scientific enterprise. To do so involves sustaining the ability of scientists and other scholars freely to communicate research findings, in accordance with applicable provisions of law, by means of publication, teaching, conferences, and other forms of scholarly exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) It is the policy of the United States to control the export of goods and substances banned or severely restricted for use in the United States in order to foster public health and safety and to prevent injury to the foreign policy of the United States as well as to the credibility of the United States as a responsible trading partner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) It is the policy of the United States to cooperate with countries which are allies of the United States and countries which share common strategic objectives with the United States in minimizing dependence on imports of energy and other critical resources from potential adversaries and in developing alternative supplies of such resources in order to minimize strategic threats posed by excessive hard currency earnings derived from such resource exports by countries with policies adverse to the security interests of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A validated license, authorizing a specific export, issued pursuant to an application by the exporter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Validated licenses authorizing multiple exports, issued pursuant to an application by the exporter, in lieu of an individual validated license for each such export, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A distribution license, authorizing exports of goods to approved distributors or users of the goods in countries other than controlled countries, except that the Secretary may establish a type of distribution license appropriate for consignees in the People's Republic of China. The Secretary shall grant the distribution license primarily on the basis of the reliability of the applicant and foreign consignees with respect to the prevention of diversion of goods to controlled countries. The Secretary shall have the responsibility of determining, with the assistance of all appropriate agencies, the reliability of applicants and their immediate consignees. The Secretary's determination shall be based on appropriate investigations of each applicant and periodic reviews of licensees and their compliance with the terms of licenses issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. Factors such as the applicant's products or volume of business, or the consignees&rsquo; geographic location, sales distribution area, or degree of foreign ownership, which may be relevant <!-- PDFPage:287 -->with respect to individual cases, shall not be determinative in creating categories or general criteria for the denial of applications or withdrawal of a distribution license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A comprehensive operations license, authorizing exports and reexports of technology and related goods, including items from the list of militarily critical technologies developed pursuant to section 5(d) of this Act [section 2404(d) of this Appendix] which are included on the control list in accordance with that section, from a domestic concern to and among its foreign subsidiaries, affiliates, joint venturers, and licensees that have long-term, contractually defined relations with the exporter, are located in countries other than controlled countries (except the People's Republic of China), and are approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall grant the license to manufacturing, laboratory, or related operations on the basis of approval of the exporter's systems of control, including internal proprietary controls, applicable to the technology and related goods to be exported rather than approval of individual export transactions. The Secretary and the Commissioner of Customs, consistent with their authorities under section 12(a) of this Act [section 2411(a) of this Appendix] and with the assistance of all appropriate agencies, shall periodically, but not less frequently than annually, perform audits of licensing procedures under this subparagraph in order to assure the integrity and effectiveness of those procedures.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Foreign availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with the provisions of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], the President shall not impose export controls for foreign policy or national security purposes on the export from the United States of goods or technology which he determines are available without restriction from sources outside the United States in sufficient quantities and comparable in quality to those produced in the United States so as to render the controls ineffective in achieving their purposes, unless the President determines that adequate evidence has been presented to him demonstrating that the absence of such controls would prove detrimental to the foreign policy or national security of the United States. In complying with the provisions of this subsection, the President shall give strong emphasis to bilateral or multilateral negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall cooperate in gathering information relating to foreign availability, including the establishment and maintenance of a jointly operated computer system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Right of export</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No authority or permission to export may be required under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], or under regulations issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], except to carry out the policies set forth in section 3 of this Act [section 2402 of this Appendix].</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(A) of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) of this Appendix], the President may, in accordance with the provisions of this section, prohibit or curtail the export of any goods or technology subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or exported by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The authority contained in this subsection includes the authority to prohibit or curtail the transfer of goods or technology within the United States to embassies and affiliates of controlled countries. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;affiliates&rdquo; includes both governmental entities and commercial entities that are controlled in fact by controlled countries. The authority contained in this subsection shall be exercised by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, and such other departments and agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate, and shall be implemented by means of export licenses described in section 4(a) of this Act [section 2403(a) of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Secretary makes any revision with respect to any goods or technology, or with respect to the countries or destinations, affected by export controls imposed under this section, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of such revision and shall specify in such notice that the revision relates to controls imposed under the authority contained in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In issuing regulations to carry out this section, particular attention shall be given to the difficulty of devising effective safeguards to prevent a country that poses a threat to the security of the United States from diverting critical technologies to military use, the difficulty of devising effective safeguards to protect critical goods, and the need to take effective measures to prevent the reexport of critical technologies from other countries to countries that pose a threat to the security of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No authority or permission may be required under this section to reexport any goods or technology subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to any country which maintains export controls on such goods or technology cooperatively with the United States pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating Committee, or pursuant to an agreement described in subsection (k) of this section. The Secretary may require any person reexporting any goods or technology under this subparagraph to notify the Secretary of such reexports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may require authority or permission to reexport the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) supercomputers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) goods or technology for sensitive nuclear uses (as defined by the Secretary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) devices for surreptitious interception of wire or oral communications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) goods or technology intended for such end users as the Secretary may specify by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no authority or permission may be required under this section to reexport any goods or technology subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from any country when the goods or technology to be reexported are incorporated in another good and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the value of the controlled United States content of that other good is 25 percent or less of the total value of the good; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the export of the goods or technology to a controlled country would require only notification of the participating governments of the Coordinating Committee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this paragraph, the &ldquo;controlled United States content&rdquo; of a good means those goods or technology subject to the jurisdiction of the United States which are incorporated in the good, if the export of those goods or technology from the United States to a country, at the time that the good is exported to that country, would require a validated license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may by regulation provide that subparagraph (A) does not apply to the reexport of a supercomputer which contains goods or technology subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this paragraph [Aug. 23, 1988], the Secretary shall issue regulations to carry out paragraphs (4) and (5). Such regulations shall define the term &ldquo;supercomputer&rdquo; for purposes of those paragraphs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy toward individual countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In administering export controls for national security purposes under this section, the President shall establish as a list of controlled countries those countries set forth in section 620(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2370(f)], except that the President may add any country to or remove any country from such list of controlled countries if he determines that the export of goods or technology to such country would or would not (as the case may be) make a significant contribution to the military potential of such country or a combination of countries which would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. In determining whether a country is added to or removed from the list of controlled countries, the President shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extent to which the country's policies are adverse to the national security interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the country's Communist or non-Communist status;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the present and potential relationship of the country with the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the present and potential relationships of the country with countries friendly or hostile to the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the country's nuclear weapons capability and the country's compliance record with respect to multilateral nuclear weapons agreements to which the United States is a party; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) such other factors as the President considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be interpreted to limit the authority of the President provided in this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this <!-- PDFPage:293 -->Appendix] to prohibit or curtail the export of any goods or technology to any country to which exports are controlled for national security purposes other than countries on the list of controlled countries specified in this paragraph. The President shall review not less frequently than every three years in the case of controls maintained cooperatively with other nations, and annually in the case of all other controls, United States policy toward individual countries to determine whether such policy is appropriate in light of the factors set forth in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no authority or permission may be required under this section to export goods or technology to a country which maintains export controls on such goods or technology cooperatively with the United States pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating Committee or pursuant to an agreement described in subsection (k) of this section, if the export of such goods or technology to the People's Republic of China or a controlled country on the date of the enactment of the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988] would require only notification of the participating governments of the Coordinating Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Secretary may require a license for the export of goods or technology described in subparagraph (A) to such end users as the Secretary may specify by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may require any person exporting goods or technology under this paragraph to notify the Secretary of those exports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall, within 3 months after the date of the enactment of the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988], determine which countries referred to in subparagraph (A) are implementing an effective export control system consistent with principles agreed to in the Coordinating Committee, including the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) national laws providing appropriate civil and criminal penalties and statutes of limitations sufficient to deter potential violations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a program to evaluate export license applications that includes sufficient technical expertise to assess the licensing status of exports and ensure the reliability of end-users;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) an enforcement mechanism that provides authority for trained enforcement officers to investigate and prevent illegal exports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a system of export control documentation to verify the movement of goods and technology; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) procedures for the coordination and exchange of information concerning violations of the agreement of the Coordinating Committee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall, at least once each year, review the determinations made under the preceding sentence with respect to all countries referred to in subparagraph (A). The Secretary may, as appropriate, add countries to, or remove countries from, the list of countries that are implementing an effective export control system in accordance with this subparagraph. No authority or permission to export may be required for the export of goods or technology to a country on such list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) No authority or permission may be required under this section to export to any country, other than a controlled country, any goods or technology if the export of the goods or technology to controlled countries would require only notification of the participating governments of the Coordinating Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may require any person exporting any goods or technology under subparagraph (A) to notify the Secretary of those exports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Control list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish and maintain, as part of the control list, a list of all goods and technology subject to export controls under this section. Such goods and technology shall be clearly identified as being subject to controls under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense and other appropriate departments and agencies shall identify goods and technology for inclusion on the list referred to in paragraph (1). Those items which the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense concur shall be subject to export controls under this section shall comprise such list. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense are unable to concur on such items, as determined by the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense may, within 20 days after receiving notification of the Secretary's determination, refer the matter to the President for resolution. The Secretary of Defense shall notify the Secretary of any such referral. The President shall, not later than 20 days after such referral, notify the Secretary of his determination with respect to the inclusion of such items on the list. Failure of the Secretary of Defense to notify the President or the Secretary, or failure of the President to notify the Secretary, in accordance with this paragraph, shall be deemed by the Secretary to constitute concurrence in the implementation of the actions proposed by the Secretary regarding the inclusion of such items on the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall conduct partial reviews of the list established pursuant to this subsection at least once each calendar quarter in order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(A) of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) of this Appendix] and the provisions of this section, and shall promptly make such revisions of the list as may be necessary after each such review. Before beginning each quarterly review, the Secretary shall publish notice of that review in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall provide a 30-day period during each review for comment and the submission of data, with or without oral presentation, by interested Government agencies and other affected or potentially affected parties. After consultation with appropriate Government agencies, the Secretary shall make a determination of any revisions in the list within 30 days after the end of the review period. The concurrence or approval of any other department or agency is not required before any such revision is made. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register any revisions in the list, with an explanation of the reasons for the revisions. The Secretary shall use the data developed from each review in formulating United States proposals relating to multilateral export controls in the group known as the Coordinating Committee. The Secretary shall further assess, <!-- PDFPage:294 -->as part of each review, the availability from sources outside the United States of goods and technology comparable to those subject to export controls imposed under this section. All goods and technology on the list shall be reviewed at least once each year. The provisions of this paragraph apply to revisions of the list which consist of removing items from the list or making changes in categories of, or other specifications in, items on the list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The appropriate technical advisory committee appointed under subsection (h) of this section shall be consulted by the Secretary with respect to changes, pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), in the list established pursuant to this subsection, and such technical advisory committee may submit recommendations to the Secretary with respect to such changes. The Secretary shall consider the recommendations of the technical advisory committee and shall inform the committee of the disposition of its recommendations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this paragraph [Aug. 23, 1988], the following shall no longer be subject to export controls under this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) All goods or technology the export of which to controlled countries on the date of the enactment of the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 [Aug. 23, 1988] would require only notification of the participating governments of the Coordinating Committee, except for those goods or technology on which the Coordinating Committee agrees to maintain such notification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) All medical instruments and equipment, subject to the provisions of subsection (m) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress annually a report setting forth the goods and technology from which export controls have been removed under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Notwithstanding subsection (f) or (h)(6) of this section, any export control imposed under this section which is maintained unilaterally by the United States shall expire 6 months after the date of the enactment of this paragraph [Aug. 23, 1988], or 6 months after the export control is imposed, whichever date is later, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any such export controls on those goods or technology for which a determination of the Secretary that there is no foreign availability has been made under subsection (f) or (h)(6) of this section before the end of the applicable 6-month period and is in effect may be renewed for periods of not more than 6 months each, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any such export controls on those goods or technology with respect to which the President, by the end of the applicable 6-month period, is actively pursuing negotiations with other countries to achieve multilateral export controls on those goods or technology may be renewed for 2 periods of not more than 6 months each.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Export controls on goods or technology described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) may be renewed only if, before each renewal, the President submits to the Congress a report setting forth all the controls being renewed and stating the specific reasons for such renewal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, after 1 year has elapsed since the last review in the Federal Register on any item within a category on the control list the export of which to the People's Republic of China would require only notification of the members of the group known as the Coordinating Committee, an export license applicant may file an allegation with the Secretary that such item has not been so reviewed within such 1-year period. Within 90 days after receipt of such allegation, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall determine the truth of the allegation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, if the allegation is confirmed, commence and complete the review of the item; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall, pursuant to such review, submit a finding for publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In such finding, the Secretary shall identify those goods or technology which shall remain on the control list and those goods or technology which shall be removed from the control list. If such review and submission for publication are not completed within that 90-day period, the goods or technology encompassed by such item shall immediately be removed from the control list.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Militarily critical technologies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall review and revise the list established pursuant to subsection (c), as prescribed in paragraph (3) of such subsection, for the purpose of insuring that export controls imposed under this section cover and (to the maximum extent consistent with the purposes of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]) are limited to militarily critical goods and technologies and the mechanisms through which such goods and technologies may be effectively transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall bear primary responsibility for developing a list of militarily critical technologies. In developing such list, primary emphasis shall be given to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arrays of design and manufacturing know-how,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) keystone manufacturing, inspection, and test equipment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) goods accompanied by sophisticated operation, application, or maintenance know-how, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) keystone equipment which would reveal or give insight into the design and manufacture of a United States military system,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">which are not possessed by, or available in fact from sources outside the United States to, controlled countries and which, if exported, would permit a significant advance in a military system of any such country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The list referred to in paragraph (2) shall be sufficiently specific to guide the determinations of any official exercising export licensing responsibilities under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall integrate items on the list of militarily <!-- PDFPage:295 -->critical technologies into the control list in accordance with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. The integration of items on the list of militarily critical technologies into the control list shall proceed with all deliberate speed. Any disagreement between the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense regarding the integration of an item on the list of militarily critical technologies into the control list shall be resolved by the President. Except in the case of a good or technology for which a validated license may be required under subsection (f)(4) or (h)(6) of this section, a good or technology shall be included on the control list only if the Secretary finds that controlled countries do not possess that good or technology, or a functionally equivalent good or technology, and the good or technology or functionally equivalent good or technology is not available in fact to a controlled country from sources outside the United States in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality so that the requirement of a validated license for the export of such good or technology is or would be ineffective in achieving the purpose set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly submit a report to the Congress, not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], on actions taken to carry out this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, assessment of whether a good or technology is functionally equivalent shall include consideration of the factors described in subsection (f)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a procedure for reviewing the goods and technology on the list of militarily critical technologies on an ongoing basis for the purpose of removing from the list of militarily critical technologies any goods or technology that are no longer militarily critical. The Secretary of Defense may add to the list of militarily critical technologies any good or technology that the Secretary of Defense determines is militarily critical, consistent with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. If the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense disagree as to whether any change in the list of militarily critical technologies by the addition or removal of a good or technology should also be made in the control list, consistent with the provisions of the fourth sentence of paragraph (4) of this subsection, the President shall resolve the disagreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The establishment of adequate export controls for militarily critical technology and keystone equipment shall be accompanied by suitable reductions in the controls on the products of that technology and equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary of Defense shall, not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], report to the Congress on efforts by the Department of Defense to assess the impact that the transfer of goods or technology on the list of militarily critical technologies to controlled countries has had or will have on the military capabilities of those countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Export licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that the effectiveness and efficiency of the process of making export licensing determinations under this section is severely hampered by the large volume of validated export license applications required to be submitted under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. Accordingly, it is the intent of Congress in this subsection to encourage the use of the multiple validated export licenses described in section 4(a)(2) of this Act [section 2403(a)(2) of this Appendix] in lieu of individual validated licenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the national security of the United States, the Secretary shall require a validated license under this section for the export of goods or technology only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the export of such goods or technology is restricted pursuant to a multilateral agreement, formal or informal, to which the United States is a party and, under the terms of such multilateral agreement, such export requires the specific approval of the parties to such multilateral agreement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to such goods or technology, other nations do not possess capabilities comparable to those possessed by the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the United States is seeking the agreement of other suppliers to apply comparable controls to such goods or technology and, in the judgment of the Secretary, United States export controls on such goods or technology, by means of such license, are necessary pending the conclusion of such agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, subject to the provisions of subsection (<em>l</em>) of this section, shall not require an individual validated export license for replacement parts which are exported to replace on a one-for-one basis parts that were in a good that has been lawfully exported from the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall periodically review the procedures with respect to the multiple validated export licenses, taking appropriate action to increase their utilization by reducing qualification requirements or lowering minimum thresholds, to combine procedures which overlap, and to eliminate those procedures which appear to be of marginal utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The export of goods subject to export controls under this section shall be eligible, at the discretion of the Secretary, for a distribution license and other licenses authorizing multiple exports of goods, in accordance with section 4(a)(2) of this Act [section 2403(a)(2) of this Appendix]. The export of technology and related goods subject to export controls under this section shall be eligible for a comprehensive operations license in accordance with section 4(a)(2)(B) of this Act [section 2403(a)(2)(B) of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any application for a license for the export to the People's Republic of China of any good on which export controls are in effect under this section, without regard to the technical specifications of the good, for the purpose of demonstration or exhibition at a trade show shall carry a presumption of approval if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the United States exporter retains title to the good during the entire period in which the good is in the People's Republic of China; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:296 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the exporter removes the good from the People's Republic of China no later than at the conclusion of the trade show.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Foreign availability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Foreign availability to controlled countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and other appropriate Government agencies and with appropriate technical advisory committees established pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, shall review, on a continuing basis, the availability to controlled countries, from sources outside the United States, including countries which participate with the United States in multilateral export controls, of any goods or technology the export of which requires a validated license under this section. In any case in which the Secretary determines, in accordance with procedures and criteria which the Secretary shall by regulation establish, that any such goods or technology are available in fact to controlled countries from such sources in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality so that the requirement of a validated license for the export of such goods or technology is or would be ineffective in achieving the purpose set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may not, after the determination is made, require a validated license for the export of such goods or technology during the period of such foreign availability, unless the President determines that the absence of export controls under this section on the goods or technology would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. In any case in which the President determines under this paragraph that export controls under this section must be maintained notwithstanding foreign availability, the Secretary shall publish that determination, together with a concise statement of its basis and the estimated economic impact of the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall approve any application for a validated license which is required under this section for the export of any goods or technology to a controlled country and which meets all other requirements for such an application, if the Secretary determines that such goods or technology will, if the license is denied, be available in fact to such country from sources outside the United States, including countries which participate with the United States in multilateral export controls, in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality so that denial of the license would be ineffective in achieving the purpose set forth in subsection (a) of this section, unless the President determines that approving the license application would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. In any case in which the Secretary makes a determination of foreign availability under this subparagraph with respect to any goods or technology, the Secretary shall determine whether a determination of foreign availability under subparagraph (A) with respect to such goods or technology is warranted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Foreign availability to other than controlled countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall review, on a continuing basis, the availability to countries other than controlled countries, from sources outside the United States, of any goods or technology the export of which requires a validated license under this section. If the Secretary determines, in accordance with procedures which the Secretary shall establish, that any goods or technology in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality are available in fact from sources outside the United States (other than availability under license from a country which maintains export controls on such goods or technology cooperatively with the United States pursuant to the agreement of the group known as the Coordinating Committee or pursuant to an agreement described in subsection (k) of this section), the Secretary may not, after the determination is made and during the period of such foreign availability, require a validated license for the export of such goods or technology to any country (other than a controlled country) to which the country from which the goods or technology is available does not place controls on the export of such goods or technology. The requirement with respect to a validated license in the preceding sentence shall not apply if the President determines that the absence of export controls under this section on the goods or technology would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. In any case in which the President determines under this paragraph that export controls under this section must be maintained notwithstanding foreign availability, the Secretary shall publish that determination, together with a concise statement of its basis and the estimated economic impact of the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall approve any application for a validated license which is required under this section for the export of any goods or technology to a country (other than a controlled country) and which meets all other requirements for such an application, if the Secretary determines that such goods or technology are available from foreign sources to that country under the criteria established in subparagraph (A), unless the President determines that approving the license application would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. In any case in which the Secretary makes a determination of foreign availability under this subparagraph with respect to any goods or technology, the Secretary shall determine whether a determination of foreign availability under subparagraph (A) with respect to such goods or technology is warranted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Procedures for making determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary shall make a foreign availability determination under paragraph (1) or (2) on the Secretary's own initiative or upon receipt of an allegation from an export license applicant that such availability exists. In making any such determination, the Secretary shall accept the representations of applicants made in writing and supported by rea<!-- PDFPage:297 -->sonable evidence, unless such representations are contradicted by reliable evidence, including scientific or physical examination, expert opinion based upon adequate factual information, or intelligence information. In making determinations of foreign availability, the Secretary may consider such factors as cost, reliability, the availability and reliability of spare parts and the cost and quality thereof, maintenance programs, durability, quality of end products produced by the item proposed for export, and scale of production. For purposes of this subparagraph, &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; may include such items as foreign manufacturers&rsquo; catalogues, brochures, or operations or maintenance manuals, articles from reputable trade publications, photographs, and depositions based upon eyewitness accounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In a case in which an allegation is received from an export license applicant, the Secretary shall, upon receipt of the allegation, submit for publication in the Federal Register notice of such receipt. Within 4 months after receipt of the allegation, the Secretary shall determine whether the foreign availability exists, and shall so notify the applicant. If the Secretary has determined that the foreign availability exists, the Secretary shall, upon making such determination, submit the determination for review to other departments and agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate. The Secretary's determination of foreign availability does not require the concurrence or approval of any official, department, or agency to which such a determination is submitted. Not later than 1 month after the Secretary makes the determination, the Secretary shall respond in writing to the applicant and submit for publication in the Federal Register, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the foreign availability does exist and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the requirement of a validated license has been removed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the President has determined that export controls under this section must be maintained notwithstanding the foreign availability and the applicable steps are being taken under paragraph (4), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) in the case of a foreign availability determination under paragraph (1), the foreign availability determination will be submitted to a multilateral review process in accordance with the agreement of the Coordinating Committee for a period of not more than 4 months beginning on the date of the publication; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the foreign availability does not exist.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In any case in which the submission for publication is not made within the time period specified in the preceding sentence, the Secretary may not thereafter require a license for the export of the goods or technology with respect to which the foreign availability allegation was made. In the case of a foreign availability determination under paragraph (1) to which clause (i)(III) applies, no license for such export may be required after the end of the 9-month period beginning on the date on which the allegation is received.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In any case in which export controls are maintained under this section notwithstanding foreign availability, on account of a determination by the President that the absence of the controls would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States, the President shall actively pursue negotiations with the governments of the appropriate foreign countries for the purpose of eliminating such availability. No later than the commencement of such negotiations, the President shall notify in writing the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives that he has begun such negotiations and why he believes it is important to national security that export controls on the goods or technology involved be maintained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If, within 6 months after the President's determination that export controls be maintained, the foreign availability has not been eliminated, the Secretary may not, after the end of that 6-month period, require a validated license for the export of the goods or technology involved. The President may extend the 6-month period described in the preceding sentence for an additional period of 12 months if the President certifies to the Congress that the negotiations involved are progressing and that the absence of the export controls involved would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. Whenever the President has reason to believe that goods or technology subject to export controls for national security purposes by the United States may become available from other countries to controlled countries and that such availability can be prevented or eliminated by means of negotiations with such other countries, the President shall promptly initiate negotiations with the governments of such other countries to prevent such foreign availability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) After an agreement is reached with a country pursuant to negotiations under this paragraph to eliminate or prevent foreign availability of goods or technology, the Secretary may not require a validated license for the export of such goods or technology to that country.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Expedited licenses for items available to countries other than controlled countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In any case in which the Secretary finds that any goods or technology from foreign sources is of similar quality to goods or technology the export of which requires a validated license under this section and is available to a country other than a controlled country without effective restrictions, the Secretary shall designate such goods or technology as eligible for export to such country under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of goods or technology designated under subparagraph (A), then 20 working days after the date of formal filing with the Secretary of an individual validated license application for the export of those goods or technology to an eligible country, a license <!-- PDFPage:298 -->for the transaction specified in the application shall become valid and effective and the goods or technology are authorized for export pursuant to such license unless the license has been denied by the Secretary on account of an inappropriate end user. The Secretary may extend the 20-day period provided in the preceding sentence for an additional period of 15 days if the Secretary requires additional time to consider the application and so notifies the applicant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary may make a foreign availability determination under subparagraph (A) on the Secretary's own initiative, upon receipt of an allegation from an export license applicant that such availability exists, or upon the submission of a certification by a technical advisory committee of appropriate jurisdiction that such availability exists. Upon receipt of such an allegation or certification, the Secretary shall publish notice of such allegation or certification in the Federal Register and shall make the foreign availability determination within 30 days after such receipt and publish the determination in the Federal Register. In the case of the failure of the Secretary to make and publish such determination within that 30-day period, the goods or technology involved shall be deemed to be designated as eligible for export to the country or countries involved, for purposes of subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) do not apply with respect to determinations of foreign availability under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Office of Foreign Availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish in the Department of Commerce an Office of Foreign Availability, which shall be under the direction of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. The Office shall be responsible for gathering and analyzing all the necessary information in order for the Secretary to make determinations of foreign availability under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. The Secretary shall make available to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate at the end of each 6-month period during a fiscal year information on the operations of the Office, and on improvements in the Government's ability to assess foreign availability, during that 6-month period, including information on the training of personnel, the use of computers, and the use of Commercial Service Officers of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service. Such information shall also include a description of representative determinations made under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] during that 6-month period that foreign availability did or did not exist (as the case may be), together with an explanation of such determinations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Sharing of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each department or agency of the United States, including any intelligence agency, and all contractors with any such department or agency, shall, upon the request of the Secretary and consistent with the protection of intelligence sources and methods, furnish information to the Office of Foreign Availability concerning foreign availability of goods and technology subject to export controls under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. Each such department or agency shall allow the Office of Foreign Availability access to any information from a laboratory or other facility within such department or agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Removal of controls on less sophisticated goods or technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2404_1_target" name="2404_1">1</a></sup> Secretary may not, pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection or paragraph (6) of subsection (h) of this section, require a validated license for the export of goods or technology, then the Secretary may not require a validated license for the export of any similar goods or technology whose function, technological approach, performance thresholds, and other attributes that form the basis for export controls under this section do not exceed the technical parameters of the goods or technology from which the validated license requirement is removed under the applicable paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Notice of all foreign availability assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Secretary undertakes a foreign availability assessment under this subsection or subsection (h)(6), the Secretary shall publish notice of such assessment in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Availability defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection and subsections (f) and (h), the term &ldquo;available in fact to controlled countries&rdquo; includes production or availability of any goods or technology in any country&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from which the goods or technology is not restricted for export to any controlled country; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in which such export restrictions are determined by the Secretary to be ineffective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (B), the mere inclusion of goods or technology on a list of goods or technology subject to bilateral or multilateral national security export controls shall not alone constitute credible evidence that a country provides an effective means of controlling the export of such goods or technology to controlled countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Indexing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to ensure that requirements for validated licenses and other licenses authorizing multiple exports are periodically removed as goods or technology subject to such requirements becomes obsolete with respect to the national security of the United States, regulations issued by the Secretary may, where appropriate, provide for annual increases in the performance levels of goods or technology subject to any such licensing requirement. The regulations issued by the Secretary shall establish as one criterion for the removal of goods or technology <!-- PDFPage:299 -->from such license requirements the anticipated needs of the military of controlled countries. Any such goods or technology which no longer meets the performance levels established by the regulations shall be removed from the list established pursuant to subsection (c) of this section unless, under such exceptions and under such procedures as the Secretary shall prescribe, any other department or agency of the United States objects to such removal and the Secretary determines, on the basis of such objection, that the goods or technology shall not be removed from the list. The Secretary shall also consider, where appropriate, removing site visitation requirements for goods and technology which are removed from the list unless objections described in this subsection are raised.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct annual reviews of the performance levels of goods or technology&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) which are eligible for export under a distribution license,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) below which exports to the People's Republic of China require only notification of the governments participating in the group known as the Coordinating Committee, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) below which no authority or permission to export may be required under subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments to such performance levels based on these reviews.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case in which the Secretary receives a request which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is to revise the qualification requirements or minimum thresholds of any goods eligible for export under a distribution license, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is made by an exporter of such goods, representatives of an industry which produces such goods, or a technical advisory committee established under subsection (h) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary, after consulting with other appropriate Government agencies and technical advisory committees established under subsection (h) of this section, shall determine whether to make such revision, or some other appropriate revision, in such qualification requirements or minimum thresholds. In making this determination, the Secretary shall take into account the availability of the goods from sources outside the United States. The Secretary shall make a determination on a request made under this subparagraph within 90 days after the date on which the request is filed. If the Secretary's determination pursuant to such a request is to make a revision, such revision shall be implemented within 120 days after the date on which the request is filed and shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Technical advisory committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon written request by representatives of a substantial segment of any industry which produces any goods or technology subject to export controls under this section or being considered for such controls because of their significance to the national security of the United States, the Secretary shall appoint a technical advisory committee for any such goods or technology which the Secretary determines are difficult to evaluate because of questions concerning technical matters, worldwide availability, and actual utilization of production and technology, or licensing procedures. Each such committee shall consist of representatives of United States industry and Government, including the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State, the intelligence community, and, in the discretion of the Secretary, other Government departments and agencies. No person serving on any such committee who is a representative of industry shall serve on such committee for more than four consecutive years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Technical advisory committees established under paragraph (1) shall advise and assist the Secretary, the Secretary of Defense, and any other department, agency, or official of the Government of the United States to which the President delegates authority under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], with respect to actions designed to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(A) of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) of this Appendix]. Such committees, where they have expertise in such matters, shall be consulted with respect to questions involving (A) technical matters, (B) worldwide availability and actual utilization of production technology, (C) licensing procedures which affect the level of export controls applicable to any goods or technology, (D) revisions of the control list (as provided in subsection (c)(4)), including proposed revisions of multilateral controls in which the United States participates, (E) the issuance of regulations, and (F) any other questions relating to actions designed to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(A) of this Act [section 2402(2)(A) of this Appendix]. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Secretary or the Secretary of Defense from consulting, at any time, with any person representing industry or the general public, regardless of whether such person is a member of a technical advisory committee. Members of the public shall be given a reasonable opportunity, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to present evidence to such committees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon request of any member of any such committee, the Secretary may, if the Secretary determines it appropriate, reimburse such member for travel, subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred by such member in connection with the duties of such member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each such committee shall elect a chairman, and shall meet at least every three months at the call of the chairman, unless the chairman determines, in consultation with the other members of the committee, that such a meeting is not necessary to achieve the purposes of this subsection. Each such committee shall be terminated after a period of 2 years, unless extended by the Secretary for additional periods of 2 years. The Secretary shall consult each such committee with respect to such termination or extension of that committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) To facilitate the work of the technical advisory committees, the Secretary, in conjunction with other departments and agencies participating in the administration of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], shall disclose <!-- PDFPage:300 -->to each such committee adequate information, consistent with national security, pertaining to the reasons for the export controls which are in effect or contemplated for the goods or technology with respect to which that committee furnishes advice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Whenever a technical advisory committee certifies to the Secretary that goods or technology with respect to which such committee was appointed have become available in fact, to controlled countries, from sources outside the United States, including countries which participate with the United States in multilateral export controls, in sufficient quantity and of comparable quality so that requiring a validated license for the export of such goods or technology would be ineffective in achieving the purpose set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the technical advisory committee shall submit that certification to the Congress at the same time the certification is made to the Secretary, together with the documentation for the certification. The Secretary shall investigate the foreign availability so certified and, not later than 90 days after the certification is made, shall submit a report to the technical advisory committee and the Congress stating that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary has removed the requirement of a validated license for the export of the goods or technology, on account of the foreign availability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary has recommended to the President that negotiations be conducted to eliminate the foreign availability, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary has determined on the basis of the investigation that the foreign availability does not exist.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent necessary, the report may be submitted on a classified basis. In any case in which the Secretary has recommended to the President that negotiations be conducted to eliminate the foreign availability, the President shall actively pursue such negotiations with the governments of the appropriate foreign countries. If, within 6 months after the Secretary submits such report to the Congress, the foreign availability has not been eliminated, the Secretary may not, after the end of that 6-month period, require a validated license for the export of the goods or technology involved. The President may extend the 6-month period described in the preceding sentence for an additional period of 12 months if the President certifies to the Congress that the negotiations involved are progressing and that the absence of the export control involved would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. After an agreement is reached with a country pursuant to negotiations under this paragraph to eliminate foreign availability of goods or technology, the Secretary may not require a validated license for the export of such goods or technology to that country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Multilateral export controls</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Recognizing the ineffectiveness of unilateral controls and the importance of uniform enforcement measures to the effectiveness of multilateral controls, the President shall enter into negotiations with the governments participating in the group known as the Coordinating Committee (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;Committee&rdquo;) with a view toward accomplishing the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Enhanced public understanding of the Committee's purpose and procedures, including publication of the list of items controlled for export by agreement of the Committee, together with all notes, understandings, and other aspects of such agreement of the Committee, and all changes thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Periodic meetings of high-level representatives of participating governments for the purpose of coordinating export control policies and issuing policy guidance to the Committee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Harmonization of export control documentation by the participating governments to verify the movement of goods and technology subject to controls by the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Improved procedures for coordination and exchange of information concerning violations of the agreement of the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Procedures for effective implementation of the agreement through uniform and consistent interpretations of export controls agreed to by the governments participating in the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Coordination of national licensing and enforcement efforts by governments participating in the Committee, including sufficient technical expertise to assess the licensing status of exports and to ensure end-use verification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) More effective procedures for enforcing export controls, including adequate training, resources, and authority for enforcement officers to investigate and prevent illegal exports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Agreement to provide adequate resources to enhance the functioning of individual national export control systems and of the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Improved enforcement and compliance with the agreement through elimination of unnecessary export controls and maintenance of an effective control list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Agreement to enhance cooperation among members of the Committee in obtaining the agreement of governments outside the Committee to restrict the export of goods and technology on the International Control List, to establish an ongoing mechanism in the Committee to coordinate planning and implementation of export control measures related to such agreements, and to remove items from the International Control List if such items continue to be available to controlled countries or if the control of the items no longer serves the common strategic objectives of the members of the Committee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of reviews of the International Control List, the President may include as advisors to the United States delegation to the Committee representatives of industry who are knowledgeable with respect to the items being reviewed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Commercial agreements with certain countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any United States firm, enterprise, or other nongovernmental entity which enters into <!-- PDFPage:301 -->an agreement with any agency of the government of a controlled country, that calls for the encouragement of technical cooperation and that is intended to result in the export from the United States to the other party of unpublished technical data of United States origin, shall report to the Secretary the agreement with such agency in sufficient detail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply to colleges, universities, or other educational institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Negotiations with other countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other appropriate departments and agencies, shall be responsible for conducting negotiations with other countries, including those countries not participating in the group known as the Coordinating Committee, regarding their cooperation in restricting the export of goods and technology in order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(9) of this Act [section 2402(9) of this Appendix], as authorized by subsection (a) of this section, including negotiations with respect to which goods and technology should be subject to multilaterally agreed export restrictions and what conditions should apply for exceptions from those restrictions. In cases where such negotiations produce agreements on export restrictions comparable in practice to those maintained by the Coordinating Committee, the Secretary shall treat exports, whether by individual or multiple licenses, to countries party to such agreements in the same manner as exports to members of the Coordinating Committee are treated, including the same manner as exports are treated under subsection (b)(2) of this section and section 10(<em>o</em>) of this Act [section 2409(<em>o</em>) of this Appendix].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Diversion of controlled goods or technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever there is reliable evidence, as determined by the Secretary, that goods or technology which were exported subject to national security controls under this section to a controlled country have been diverted to an unauthorized use or consignee in violation of the conditions of an export license, the Secretary for as long as that diversion continues&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall deny all further exports, to or by the party or parties responsible for that diversion or who conspired in that diversion, of any goods or technology subject to national security controls under this section, regardless of whether such goods or technology are available from sources outside the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may take such additional actions under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] with respect to the party or parties referred to in subparagraph (A) as the Secretary determines are appropriate in the circumstances to deter the further unauthorized use of the previously exported goods or technology.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;unauthorized use&rdquo; means the use of United States goods or technology in the design, production, or maintenance of any item on the United States Munitions List, or the military use of any item on the International Control List of the Coordinating Committee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Goods containing controlled parts and components</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Export controls may not be imposed under this section, or under any other provision of law, on a good solely on the basis that the good contains parts or components subject to export controls under this section if such parts or components&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) are customarily included in sales of the good in countries other than controlled countries, and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2405. Foreign policy controls</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in paragraph (2)(B), (7), (8), or (13) of section 3 of this Act [section 2402(2)(B), (7), (8), or (13) of this Appendix], the President may prohibit or curtail the exportation of any goods, technology, or other information subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or exported by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to the extent necessary to further significantly the foreign policy of the United States or to fulfill its declared international obligations. The authority granted by this subsection shall be exercised by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Treasury, the United States Trade Representative, and such other departments and agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate, and shall be implemented by means of export licenses issued by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any export control imposed under this section shall apply to any transaction or activity undertaken with the intent to evade that export control, even if that export control would not otherwise apply to that transaction or activity.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:305 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Export controls maintained for foreign policy purposes shall expire on December 31, 1979, or one year after imposition, whichever is later, unless extended by the President in accordance with subsections (b) and (f). Any such extension and any subsequent extension shall not be for a period of more than one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever the Secretary denies any export license under this subsection, the Secretary shall specify in the notice to the applicant of the denial of such license that the license was denied under the authority contained in this subsection, and the reasons for such denial, with reference to the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The Secretary shall also include in such notice what, if any, modifications in or restrictions on the goods or technology for which the license was sought would allow such export to be compatible with controls implemented under this section, or the Secretary shall indicate in such notice which officers and employees of the Department of Commerce who are familiar with the application will be made reasonably available to the applicant for consultation with regard to such modifications or restrictions, if appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In accordance with the provisions of section 10 of this Act [section 2409 of this Appendix], the Secretary of State shall have the right to review any export license application under this section which the Secretary of State requests to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Before imposing, expanding, or extending export controls under this section on exports to a country which can use goods, technology, or information available from foreign sources and so incur little or no economic costs as a result of the controls, the President should, through diplomatic means, employ alternatives to export controls which offer opportunities of distinguishing the United States from, and expressing the displeasure of the United States with, the specific actions of that country in response to which the controls are proposed. Such alternatives include private discussions with foreign leaders, public statements in situations where private diplomacy is unavailable or not effective, withdrawal of ambassadors, and reduction of the size of the diplomatic staff that the country involved is permitted to have in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the President may impose, extend, or expand export controls under this section only if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such controls are likely to achieve the intended foreign policy purpose, in light of other factors, including the availability from other countries of the goods or technology proposed for such controls, and that foreign policy purpose cannot be achieved through negotiations or other alternative means;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the proposed controls are compatible with the foreign policy objectives of the United States and with overall United States policy toward the country to which exports are to be subject to the proposed controls;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to those export controls in effect under this section on the date of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], the President, in determining whether to extend those controls, as required by subsection (a)(3) of this section, shall consider the criteria set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall consider the foreign policy consequences of modifying the export controls.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation with industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary in every possible instance shall consult with and seek advice from affected United States industries and appropriate advisory committees established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2155] before imposing any export control under this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President may impose or expand export controls under this section, or extend such controls as required by subsection (a)(3) of this section, only after consultation with the Congress, including the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President may not impose, expand, or extend export controls under this section until the President has submitted to the Congress a report&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) specifying the determinations of the President (or, in the case of those export controls described in subsection (b)(2), the considerations of the President) with respect to each of the criteria set forth in subsection (b)(1), the bases for such determinations (or considerations), and any possible adverse foreign policy consequences of the controls;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Such report shall also indicate how such controls will further significantly the foreign policy of the United States or will further its declared international obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To the extent necessary to further the effectiveness of the export controls, portions of a report required by paragraph (2) may be submitted to the Congress on a classified basis, and shall be subject to the provisions of section 12(c) of this Act [section 2411(c) of this Appendix]. Each such report shall, at the same time it is submitted to the Congress, also be submitted to the General Accounting Office for the purpose of assessing the report's full compliance with the intent of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of export controls under this section which prohibit or curtail the export of any agricultural commodity, a report submitted pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be deemed to be the report required by section 7(g)(3)(A) of this Act [section 2406(g)(3)(A) of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In addition to any written report required under this section, the Secretary, not less frequently than annually, shall present in oral testimony before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on policies and actions taken by the Government to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusion for medicine and medical supplies and for certain food exports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not authorize export controls on medicine or medical supplies. This section also does not authorize export controls on donations of goods (including, but not limited to, food, educational materials, seeds and hand tools, medicines and medical supplies, water resources equipment, clothing and shelter materials, and basic household supplies) that are intended to meet basic human needs. Before export controls on food are imposed, expanded, or extended under this section, the Secretary shall notify the Secretary of State in the case of export controls applicable with respect to any developed country and shall notify the Director of the United States International Development Cooperation Agency in the case of export controls applicable with respect to any developing country. The Secretary of State with respect to developed countries, and the Director with respect to developing countries, shall determine whether the proposed export controls on food would cause measurable malnutrition and shall inform the Secretary of that determination. If the Secretary is informed that the proposed export controls on food would cause measurable malnutrition, then those controls may not be imposed, expanded, or extended, as the case may be, unless the President determines that those controls are necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States, or unless the President determines that arrangements are insufficient to ensure that the food will reach those most in need. Each such determination by the Secretary of State or the Director of the United States International Development Cooperation Agency, and any such determination by the President, shall be reported to the Congress, together with a statement of the reasons for that determination. It is the intent of Congress that the President not impose export controls under this section on any goods or technology if he determines that the principal effect of the export of such goods or technology would be to help meet basic human needs. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the President from imposing restrictions on the export of medicine or medical supplies or of food under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act [50 U.S.C 1701 et seq.]. This subsection shall not apply to any export control on medicine, medical supplies, or food, except for donations, which is in effect on the date of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985]. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, the President may impose export controls under this section on medicine, medical supplies, food, and donations of goods in order to carry out the policy set forth in paragraph (13) of section 3 of this Act [section 2402(13) of this Appendix].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Foreign availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In applying export controls under this section, the President shall take all feasible steps to initiate and conclude negotiations with appropriate foreign governments for the purpose of securing the cooperation of such foreign governments in controlling the export to countries and consignees to which the United States export controls apply of any goods or technology comparable to goods or technology controlled under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before extending any export control pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section, the President shall evaluate the results of his actions under paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall include the results of that evaluation in his report to the Congress pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, within 6 months after the date on which export controls under this section are imposed <!-- PDFPage:307 -->or expanded, or within 6 months after the date of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985] in the case of export controls in effect on such date of enactment, the President's efforts under paragraph (1) are not successful in securing the cooperation of foreign governments described in paragraph (1) with respect to those export controls, the Secretary shall thereafter take into account the foreign availability of the goods or technology subject to the export controls. If the Secretary affirmatively determines that a good or technology subject to the export controls is available in sufficient quantity and comparable quality from sources outside the United States to countries subject to the export controls so that denial of an export license would be ineffective in achieving the purposes of the controls, then the Secretary shall, during the period of such foreign availability, approve any license application which is required for the export of the good or technology and which meets all requirements for such a license. The Secretary shall remove the good or technology from the list established pursuant to subsection (<em>l</em>) of this section if the Secretary determines that such action is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In making a determination of foreign availability under paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Secretary shall follow the procedures set forth in section 5(f)(3) of this Act [section 2404(f)(3) of this Appendix].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) International obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), and (h) shall not apply in any case in which the President exercises the authority contained in this section to impose export controls, or to approve or deny export license applications, in order to fulfill obligations of the United States pursuant to treaties to which the United States is a party or pursuant to other international agreements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Countries supporting international terrorism</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A determination made by the Secretary of State under paragraph (1)(A) may not be rescinded unless the President submits to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the President may prohibit or curtail the export of any goods subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or exported by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. In curtailing exports to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the President shall allocate a portion of export licenses on the basis of factors other than a prior history of exportation. Such factors shall include the extent to which a country engages in equitable trade practices with respect to United States goods and treats the United States equitably in times of short supply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon imposing quantitative restrictions on exports of any goods to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the Secretary shall include in a notice published in the Federal Register with respect to such restrictions an invitation to all interested parties to submit written comments within 15 days from the date of publication on the impact of such restrictions and the method of licensing used to implement them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In imposing export controls under this section, the President's authority shall include, but not be limited to, the imposition of export license fees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], the Secretary shall monitor exports, and contracts for exports, of any good (other than a commodity which is subject to the reporting requirements of section 812&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2406_1_target" name="2406_1">1</a></sup> of the Agricultural Act of 1970 [7 U.S.C. 612c&ndash;3]) when the volume of such exports in relation to domestic supply contributes, or may contribute, to an increase in domestic prices or a domestic shortage, and such price increase or shortage has, or may have, a serious adverse impact on the economy or any sector thereof. Any such monitoring shall commence at a time adequate to assure that the monitoring will result in a data base sufficient to enable policies to be developed, in accordance with section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix], to mitigate a short supply situation or serious inflationary price rise or, if export controls are needed, to permit imposition of such controls in a timely manner. Information which the Secretary requires to be furnished in effecting such monitoring shall be confidential, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The results of such monitoring shall, to the extent practicable, be aggregated and included in weekly reports setting forth, with respect to each item monitored, actual and anticipated exports, the destination by country, and the domestic and worldwide price, supply, and demand. Such reports may be made monthly if the Secretary determines that there is insufficient information to justify weekly reports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Energy to determine whether monitoring or export controls under this section are warranted with respect to exports of facilities, machinery, or equipment normally and principally used, or intended to be used, in the production, conversion, or transportation of fuels and energy (except nuclear energy), including, but not limited to, drilling rigs, platforms, and equipment; petroleum refineries, natural gas processing, liquefaction, and gasification plants; facilities for production of synthetic natural gas or synthetic crude oil; oil and gas pipelines, pumping stations, and associated equipment; and vessels for transporting oil, gas, coal, and other fuels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petitions for monitoring or controls</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any entity, including a trade association, firm, or certified or recognized union or group of workers, that is representative of an industry or a substantial segment of an industry that processes metallic materials capable of being recycled may transmit a written petition <!-- PDFPage:313 -->to the Secretary requesting the monitoring of exports or the imposition of export controls, or both, with respect to any such material, in order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each petition shall be in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall contain information in support of the action requested. The petition shall include any information reasonably available to the petitioner indicating that each of the criteria set forth in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection is satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 15 days after receipt of any petition described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register. The notice shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include the name of the material that is the subject of the petition,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include the Schedule B number of the material as set forth in the Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exported from the United States,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) indicate whether the petitioner is requesting that controls or monitoring, or both, be imposed with respect to the exportation of such material, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide that interested persons shall have a period of 30 days beginning on the date of publication of such notice to submit to the Secretary written data, views or arguments, with or without opportunity for oral presentation, with respect to the matter involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">At the request of the petitioner or any other entity described in paragraph (1)(A) with respect to the material that is the subject of the petition, or at the request of any entity representative of producers or exporters of such material, the Secretary shall conduct public hearings with respect to the subject of the petition, in which case the 30-day period may be extended to 45 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Within 45 days after the end of the 30- or 45-day period described in paragraph (2), as the case may be, the Secretary shall determine whether to impose monitoring or controls, or both, on the export of the material that is the subject of the petition, in order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix]. In making such determination, the Secretary shall determine whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) there has been a significant increase, in relation to a specific period of time, in exports of such material in relation to domestic supply and demand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there has been a significant increase in the domestic price of such material or a domestic shortage of such material relative to demand;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) exports of such material are as important as any other cause of a domestic price increase or shortage relative to demand found under clause (ii);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) a domestic price increase or shortage relative to demand found under clause (ii) has significantly adversely affected or may significantly adversely affect the national economy or any sector thereof, including a domestic industry; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) monitoring or controls, or both, are necessary in order to carry out the policy set forth in section 3(2)(C) of this Act [section 2402(2)(C) of this Appendix].</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The President shall also notify the Congress if and when he determines that such export controls are no longer necessary. During any period in which a determination that such export controls are necessary is in effect, no refined petroleum product may be exported except pursuant to an export license specifically authorizing such export. Not later than 5 days after an application for a license to export any refined petroleum product or residual fuel oil is received, the Secretary shall notify the Congress of such application, together with the name of the exporter, the destination of the proposed export, and the amount and price of the proposed export.

The Secretary may not grant such approval unless the Secretary receives adequate assurance and, in conjunction with the Secretary of Agriculture, finds (A) that such commodities will eventually be exported, (B) that neither the sale nor export thereof will result in an excessive drain of scarce materials and have a serious domestic inflationary impact, (C) that storage of such commodities in the United States will not unduly limit the space available for storage of domestically owned commodities, and (D) that the purpose of such storage is to establish a reserve of such commodities for later use, not including resale to or use by another country. The Secretary may issue such regulations as may be necessary to implement this paragraph.</p>

If the Congress, within 60 days after the date of its receipt of such report, fails to adopt a joint resolution approving such controls, then such controls shall cease to be effective upon the expiration of that 60-day period.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibitions and exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of implementing the policies set forth in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (5) of section 3 of this Act [section 2402(5)(A) or (B) of this Appendix], the President shall issue regulations prohibiting any United States person, with respect to his activities in the interstate or foreign commerce of the United States, from taking or knowingly agreeing to take any of the following actions with intent to comply with, further, or support any boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:319 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Refusing, or requiring any other person to refuse, to do business with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with any national or resident of the boycotted country, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement with, a requirement of, or a request from or on behalf of the boycotting country. The mere absence of a business relationship with or in the boycotted country with any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with any national or resident of the boycotted country, or with any other person, does not indicate the existence of the intent required to establish a violation of regulations issued to carry out this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Refusing, or requiring any other person to refuse, to employ or otherwise discriminating against any United States person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, sex, or national origin of any United States person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the boycotted country, with any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country, with any national or resident of the boycotted country, or with any other person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in the boycotting country. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit the furnishing of normal business information in a commercial context as defined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the boycotted country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing a letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement compliance with which is prohibited by regulations issued pursuant to this paragraph, and no United States person shall, as a result of the application of this paragraph, be obligated to pay or otherwise honor or implement such letter of credit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations issued pursuant to paragraph (1) shall provide exceptions for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) complying or agreeing to comply with requirements (i) prohibiting the import of goods or services from the boycotted country or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of the boycotted country or by nationals or residents of the boycotted country, or (ii) prohibiting the shipment of goods to the boycotting country on a carrier of the boycotted country, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipment as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurers, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) complying or agreeing to comply with export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to the boycotted country, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of the boycotted country, or to any national or resident of the boycotted country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) compliance by a United States person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations issued pursuant to paragraphs (2)(C) and (2)(F) shall not provide exceptions from paragraphs (1)(B) and (1)(C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to supersede or limit the operation of the antitrust or civil rights laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) This section shall apply to any transaction or activity undertaken, by or through a United States person or any other person, with intent to evade the provisions of this section as implemented by the regulations issued pursuant to this subsection, and such regulations shall expressly provide that the exceptions set forth in paragraph (2) shall not permit activities or agreements (expressed or implied by a course of conduct, including a pattern of responses) other<!-- PDFPage:320 -->wise prohibited, which are not within the intent of such exceptions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foreign policy controls</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to the regulations issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, regulations issued under section 6 of this Act [section 2405 of this Appendix] shall implement the policies set forth in section 3(5) [section 2402(5) of this Appendix].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations shall require that any United States person receiving a request for the furnishing of information, the entering into or implementing of agreements, or the taking of any other action referred to in section 3(5) [section 2402(5) of this Appendix] shall report that fact to the Secretary, together with such other information concerning such request as the Secretary may require for such action as the Secretary considers appropriate for carrying out the policies of that section. Such person shall also report to the Secretary whether such person intends to comply and whether such person has complied with such request. Any report filed pursuant to this paragraph shall be made available promptly for public inspection and copying, except that information regarding the quantity, description, and value of any goods or technology to which such report relates may be kept confidential if the Secretary determines that disclosure thereof would place the United States person involved at a competitive disadvantage. The Secretary shall periodically transmit summaries of the information contained in such reports to the Secretary of State for such action as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, considers appropriate for carrying out the policies set forth in section 3(5) of this Act [section 2402(5) of this Appendix].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section and the regulations issued pursuant thereto shall preempt any law, rule, or regulation of any of the several States or the District of Columbia, or any of the territories or possessions of the United States, or of any governmental subdivision thereof, which law, rule, or regulation pertains to participation in, compliance with, implementation of, or the furnishing of information regarding restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any person who, in such person's domestic manufacturing process or other domestic business operation, utilizes a product produced abroad in whole or in part from a good historically obtained from the United States but which has been made subject to export controls, or any person who historically has exported such a good, may transmit a petition of hardship to the Secretary requesting an exemption from such controls in order to alleviate any unique hardship resulting from the imposition of such controls. A petition under this section shall be in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall contain information demonstrating the need for the relief requested.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Decision of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 30 days after receipt of any petition under subsection (a), the Secretary shall transmit a written decision to the petitioner granting or denying the requested relief. Such decision shall contain a statement setting forth the Secretary's basis for the grant or denial. Any exemption granted may be subject to such conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the Secretary's decision with respect to the grant or denial of relief from unique hardship resulting directly or indirectly from the imposition of export controls shall reflect the Secretary's consideration of factors such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Whether denial would cause a unique hardship to the petitioner which can be alleviated only by granting an exception to the applicable regulations. In determining whether relief shall be granted, the Secretary shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ownership of material for which there is no practicable domestic market by virtue of the location or nature of the material;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) potential serious financial loss to the applicant if not granted an exception;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) inability to obtain, except through import, an item essential for domestic use which is produced abroad from the good under control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the extent to which denial would conflict, to the particular detriment of the applicant, with other national policies including those reflected in any international agreement to which the United States is a party;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) possible adverse effects on the economy (including unemployment) in any locality or region of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) other relevant factors, including the applicant's lack of an exporting history during any base period that may be established <!-- PDFPage:321 -->with respect to export quotas for the particular good.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In all cases, the desire to sell at higher prices and thereby obtain greater profits shall not be considered as evidence of a unique hardship, nor will circumstances where the hardship is due to imprudent acts or failure to act on the part of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Defense shall determine, in consultation with the Secretary, and confirm in writing the types and categories of transactions which should be reviewed by the Secretary of Defense in order to make a determination referred to in paragraph (1). Whenever a license or other authority is requested for the export to any country to which exports are controlled for national security purposes of goods or technology within any such type or category, the Secretary shall notify the Secretary of Defense of such request, and the Secretary may not issue any license or other authority pursuant to such request before the expiration of the period with<!-- PDFPage:323 -->in which the President may disapprove such export.

If the President notifies the Secretary, within 20 days after receiving a recommendation from the Secretary of Defense, that he disapproves such export, no license or other authority may be issued for the export of such goods or technology to such country. If the Secretary of Defense fails to make a recommendation or notification under this paragraph within the 20-day period specified in the third sentence, or if the President, within 20 days after receiving a recommendation from the Secretary of Defense with respect to an export, fails to notify the Secretary that he approves or disapproves the export, the Secretary shall approve or deny the request for a license or other authority to export without such recommendation or notification.</p>

The license shall be issued upon approval of the application under such multilateral review. If such multilateral review has not resulted in a determination with respect to the application within 40 days after such date, the Secretary's approval of the license shall be final and the license shall be issued, unless the Secretary determines that issuance of the license would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. At the time at which the Secretary makes such a determination, the Secretary shall notify the applicant of the determination and shall notify the Congress of the determination, the reasons for the determination, the reasons for which the multilateral review could not be concluded within such 40-day period, and the actions planned or being taken by the United States Government to secure conclusion of the multilateral review.

When such petition is filed, the Secretary shall take immediate steps to correct the situation giving rise to the petition and shall immediately notify the applicant of such steps.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, within 20 days after a petition is filed under paragraph (2), the processing of the application has not been brought into conformity with the requirements of this section, or the application has been brought into conformity with such requirements but the Secretary has not so notified the applicant, the applicant may bring an action in an appropriate United States district court for a restraining order, a temporary or permanent injunction, or other appropriate relief, to require compliance with the requirements of this section. The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction to provide such relief, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Changes in requirements for applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b)(3) of this section, in any case in which, after a license application is submitted, the Secretary changes the requirements for such a license application, the Secretary may request appropriate additional information of the applicant, but the Sec<!-- PDFPage:324 -->retary may not return the application to the applicant without action because it fails to meet the changed requirements.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in section 11(c)(2) [section 2410(c)(2) of this Appendix] and subsection (c) of this section, the functions exercised under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] are excluded from the operation of sections 551, 553 through 559, and 701 through 706 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Public participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intent of the Congress that, to the extent practicable, all regulations imposing controls on exports under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] be issued in proposed form with meaningful opportunity for public comment before taking effect. In cases where a regulation imposing controls under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] is issued with immediate effect, it is the intent of the Congress that meaningful opportunity for public comment also be provided and that the regulation be reissued in final form after public comments have been fully considered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures relating to civil penalties and sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which a civil penalty or other civil sanction (other than a temporary denial order or a penalty or sanction for a violation of section 8 [section 2407 of this Appendix]) is sought under section 11 of this Act [section 2410 of this Appendix], the charged party is entitled to receive a formal complaint specifying the charges and, at his or her request, to contest the charges in a hearing before an administrative law judge. Subject to the provisions of this subsection, any such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United States Code. With the approval of the administrative law judge, the Government may present evidence in camera in the presence of the charged party or his or her representative. After the hearing, the administrative law judge shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law in a written decision, which shall be referred to the Secretary. The Secretary shall, in a written order, affirm, modify, or vacate the decision of the administrative law judge within 30 days after receiving the decision. The order of the Secretary shall be final and is not subject to judicial review, except as provided in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The proceedings described in paragraph (1) shall be concluded within a period of 1 year after the complaint is submitted, unless the administrative law judge extends such period for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The order of the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall be final, except that the charged party may, within 15 days after the order is issued, appeal the order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall have jurisdiction of the appeal. The court may, while the appeal is pending, stay the order of the Secretary. The court may review only those issues necessary to determine liability for the civil penalty or other sanction involved. In an appeal filed under this paragraph, the court shall set aside any finding of fact for which the court finds there is not substantial evidence on the record and any conclusion of law which the court finds to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An administrative law judge referred to in this subsection shall be appointed by the Secretary from among those considered qualified for selection and appointment under section 3105 of title 5, United States Code. Any person who, for at least 2 of the 10 years immediately preceding the date of the enactment of the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 [July 12, 1985], has served as a hearing commissioner of the Department of Commerce shall be included among those considered as qualified for selection and appointment to such position.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Imposition of temporary denial orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which it is necessary, in the public interest, to prevent an imminent violation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] or any regulation, order, or license issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix], the Secretary may, without a hearing, issue an order temporarily denying United States export privileges (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a &ldquo;temporary denial order&rdquo;) to a person. A temporary denial order may be effective no longer than 180 days unless <!-- PDFPage:339 -->renewed in writing by the Secretary for additional 180-day periods in order to prevent such an imminent violation, except that a temporary denial order may be renewed only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing is provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A temporary denial order shall define the imminent violation and state why the temporary denial order was granted without a hearing. The person or persons subject to the issuance or renewal of a temporary denial order may file an appeal of the issuance or renewal of the temporary denial order with an administrative law judge who shall, within 10 working days after the appeal is filed, recommend that the temporary denial order be affirmed, modified, or vacated. Parties may submit briefs and other material to the judge. The recommendation of the administrative law judge shall be submitted to the Secretary who shall either accept, reject, or modify the recommendation by written order within 5 working days after receiving the recommendation. The written order of the Secretary under the preceding sentence shall be final and is not subject to judicial review, except as provided in paragraph (3). The temporary denial order shall be affirmed only if it is reasonable to believe that the order is required in the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix] or any regulation, order, or license issued under this Act [sections 2401 to 2420 of this Appendix]. All materials submitted to the administrative law judge and the Secretary shall constitute the administrative record for purposes of review by the courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An order of the Secretary affirming, in whole or in part, the issuance of a temporary denial order may, within 15 days after the order is issued, be appealed by a person subject to the order to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which shall have jurisdiction of the appeal. The court may review only those issues necessary to determine whether the standard for issuing the temporary denial order has been met. The court shall vacate the Secretary's order if the court finds that the Secretary's order is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Appeals from license denials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A determination of the Secretary, under section 10(f) of this Act [section 2409(f) of this Appendix], to deny a license may be appealed by the applicant to an administrative law judge who shall have the authority to conduct proceedings to determine only whether the item sought to be exported is in fact on the control list. Such proceedings shall be conducted within 90 days after the appeal is filed. Any determination by an administrative law judge under this subsection and all materials filed before such judge in the proceedings shall be reviewed by the Secretary, who shall either affirm or vacate the determination in a written decision within 30 days after receiving the determination. The Secretary's written decision shall be final and is not subject to judicial review. Subject to the limitations provided in section 12(c) of this Act [section 2411(c) of this Appendix], the Secretary's decision shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
