<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2. Findings and statement of purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that the Appalachian region of the United States, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of the Nation in its economic growth and that its people have not shared properly in the Nation's prosperity. The region's uneven past development, with its historical reliance on a few basic industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the economic base that is a vital prerequisite for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. The State and local governments and the people of the region understand their problems and have been working and will continue to work purposefully toward their solution. The Congress recognizes the comprehensive report of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission documenting these findings and concludes that regionwide development is feasible, desirable, and urgently needed. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Act to assist the region in meeting its special problems, to promote its economic development, and to establish a framework for joint Federal and State efforts toward providing the basic facilities essential to its growth and attacking its common problems and meeting its common needs on a coordinated and concerted regional basis. The public investments made in the region under this Act shall be concentrated in areas where there is a significant potential for future growth, and where the expected return on public dollars invested will be the greatest. The States will be responsible for recommending local and State projects, within their borders, which will receive assistance under this Act. As the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources, the Congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry, and that the region will then be able to support itself, through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the foregoing purposes, especially with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. The Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region, but also its relationship to a nation now assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia now has the opportunity, in accommodating future growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and coordinated planning so that housing, public services, transportation and other community facilities will be provided in a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of life for the people of the region. The Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring in national energy requirements and production, which not only risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize social and environmental costs to the region and its people. It is, therefore, also the purpose of this Act to provide a framework for coordinating Federal, State and local efforts toward (1) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices, (2) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize social and environmental costs, and (3) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by Federal, State, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation's energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, community facilities, and human services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is hereby established an Appalachian Regional Commission (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) which shall be composed of one Federal member, hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Federal Cochairman&rdquo;, appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and one member from each participating State in the Appalachian region. The Federal Cochairman shall be one of the two Cochairmen of the Commission. Each State member shall be the Governor. The State members of the Commission shall elect a Cochairman of the Commission from among their number for a term of not less than one year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in section 105, decisions by the Commission shall require the affirmative vote of the Federal Cochairman and of a majority of the State members (exclusive of members representing States delinquent under section 105). In matters coming before the Commission, the Federal Cochairman shall, to the extent practicable, consult with the Federal departments and agencies having an interest in the subject matter. No decision involving Commission policy, approval of State, regional or subregional development plans or implementing investment programs, any modification or revision of the Appalachian Regional Commission Code, or any allocation of funds among the States may be made without a quorum of State members present. The approval of project and grant proposals shall be a responsibility of the Commission and exercised in accordance with section 303 of this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each State member may have a single alternate, appointed by the Governor from among the members of the Governor's cabinet or the Governor's personal staff. The President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint an alternate for the Federal Cochairman. An alternate shall vote in the event of the absence, death, disability, removal, or resignation of the State or Federal representative for which he is an alternate. A State alternate shall not be counted toward the establishment of a quorum of the Commission in any instance in which a quorum of the State members is required to be present. No Commission powers or responsibilities specified in the last two sentences of subsection (b) of this section, nor the vote of any Commission member, may be delegated to any person not a Commission member or who is not entitled to vote in Commission meetings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Federal Cochairman shall be compensated by the Federal Government at level III of the Executive Schedule in subchapter II of chapter 53 of title V, United States Code. His alternate shall be compensated by the Federal Government at level V of such Executive Schedule, and when not actively serving as an alternate for the Federal Cochairman, shall perform such functions and duties as are delegated to him by the Federal Cochairman. Each State member and his alternate shall be compensated by the State which they represent at the rate established by law of such State.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;201. Appalachian development highway system</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In order to provide a highway system which, in conjunction with the Interstate System and other Federal-aid highways in the Appalachian region, will open up an area or areas with a developmental potential where commerce and communication have been inhibited by lack of adequate access, the Secretary of Transportation (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to assist in the construction of an Appalachian development highway system and local access roads serving the Appalachian region. The provisions of sections 106(a) and 118 of title 23, United States Code, relating to the obligation, period of availability, and expenditure of Federal-aid highway funds, shall apply to the development highway system and the local access roads, and all other provisions of such title 23 that are applicable to the construction and maintenance of Federal-aid primary and secondary highways and which the Secretary determines are not inconsistent with this Act shall apply, respectively, to such system and roads. Construction on the development highway system shall not exceed three thousand and twenty-five miles. Construction of local access roads shall not exceed one thousand four hundred miles that will serve specific recreational, residential, educational, commercial, industrial, or other like facilities or will facilitate a school consolidation program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Commission shall transmit to the Secretary its designations of (1) the general corridor location and termini of the development highways, (2) local access roads to be constructed, (3) priorities for the construction of segments of the development highways, and (4) other criteria for the program authorized by this section. Before any State member participates in or votes on such designations, he shall have obtained the recommendations of the State highway department of the State which he represents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In no event shall the Secretary assist in any construction (including right-of-way acquisition) which would require for its completion the expenditure of Federal funds (other than funds available under title 23, United States Code) in excess of the appropriations authorization in subsection (g). On its completion each development highway not already on the Federal-aid primary system shall be added to such system and each development highway and local access road shall be required to be maintained by the State as provided for Federal-aid highways in title 23, United States Code.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In the construction of highways and roads authorized under this section, the States may give special preference to the use of materials and products indigenous to the Appalachian region.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For the purposes of research and development in the use of coal and coal products in highway construction and maintenance, the Secretary is authorized to require each participating State, to the maximum extent possible, to use coal derivatives in the construction of not to exceed 10 per centum of the roads authorized under this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Federal assistance to any construction project under this section shall not exceed 80 per centum of the costs of such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) To carry out this section, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the President, to be available until expended, $175,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971; $175,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972; $180,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973; $180,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974; $185,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975; $185,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976; $185,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1977; $250,000,000 for fiscal year 1978; $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1979; $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1980; $215,000,000 for fiscal year 1981; and $165,000,000 for fiscal year 1982.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) When a participating State proceeds to construct a segment of a development highway without the aid of Federal funds, in accordance with all procedures and requirements applicable to the construction of segments of Appalachian development highways with such funds, except insofar as such procedures and requirements limit a State to the construction of projects for which Federal funds have previously been appropriated, the Secretary, upon application by the State and with the approval of the Commission, is authorized to pay to the State the Federal share not to exceed 70 per centum of the costs of the construction of such segment, from any sums appropriated and allocated to such State to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection shall not be construed as a commitment or obligation on the part of the United States to provide funds for segments of development highways constructed under this subsection, and shall not increase the limitation on construction in subsection (c).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;202. Demonstration health projects</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In order to demonstrate the value of adequate health facilities and services to the economic development of the region, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to make grants for the planning, construction, equipment, and operation of multi-county demonstration health, nutrition, and child care projects, including hospitals, regional health diagnostic and treatment centers and other facilities and services necessary for the purposes of this section. Grants for such construction (including the acquisition of privately owned facilities not operated for profit or previously operated for profit where the acquisition of such facilities is the most cost-effective means for providing increased health services if the Commission finds that but for the acquisition for such facility such health services would not be otherwise provided in the area served by such facility, and initial equipment) shall be made in accordance with section 223 of this Act and shall not be incompatible with the applicable provisions of title VI of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 291&ndash;291<em>o</em>), the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963 (77 Stat. 282), and other laws authorizing grants for the construction of health-related facilities, without regard to any provisions therein relating to appropriation authorization ceilings or to allotments among the States. Grants under this section shall be made solely out of funds specifically appropriated for the purpose of carrying out this Act and shall not be taken into account in the computation of the allotments among the States made pursuant to any other provisions of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) No grant for the construction or equipment of any component of a demonstration health project shall exceed 80 per centum of such costs. The Federal contribution may be provided entirely from funds authorized under this section or in combination with funds provided under other Federal grant-in-aid programs for the construction or equipment of health-related facilities. Notwithstanding any provision of law limiting the Federal share in such other programs, funds authorized under this section may be used to increase Federal grants for component facilities of a demonstration health project to a maximum of 80 per centum of the cost of such facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Grants under this section for operation (including initial operating funds and operating deficits comprising among other items the costs of attracting, training, and retaining qualified personnel) of a demonstration health project, whether or not constructed with funds authorized by this section, may be made for up to 100 per centum of the costs thereof for the two-year period beginning, for each component facility or service assisted under any such operating grant, on the first day that such facility or service is in operation as a part of the project. For the next three years of operations such grants shall not exceed 75 per centum of such costs. The Federal contribution may be provided entirely from funds appropriated to carry out this section or in combination with funds provided under other Federal grant-in-aid programs for the operation of health related facilities and the provisions of health and child development services, including title IV, parts A and B, and title XX of the Social Security Act. Notwithstanding any provision of the Social Security Act requiring assistance or services on a statewide basis, if a State provides assistance or services under such a program in any area of the region approved by the Commission, such State shall be considered as meeting such requirement. Notwithstanding any provision of law limiting the Federal share in such other programs, funds appropriated to carry out this section may be used to increase Federal grants for operating components of a demonstration health project to the maximum percentage cost thereof authorized by this subsection. No grant for operation of a demonstration health project shall be made unless the facility is publicly owned, or owned by a public or private nonprofit organization, and is not operated for profit. No grants for operation of a demonstration health project shall be made after five years following the commencement of the initial grant for operation of the project, except that child development demonstrations assisted under this section during fiscal year 1979 may, upon State request, be approved under section 303 of this Act for continued support beyond that period if the Commission finds that no Federal, State, or local funds are available to continue such demonstrations. No such grants shall be made unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services is satisfied that the operation of the project will be conducted under efficient management practices designed to obviate operating deficits. Notwithstanding section 104 of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 554; 42 U.S.C. 3134), a health-related facility constructed under title I of that Act may be a component of a demonstration health project eligible for operating grant assistance under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to provide funds to the Commission for the support of its Health Advisory Committee and to make grants for expenses of planning necessary for the development and operation of demonstration health projects for the region. The amount of any such grant shall not exceed 75 per centum of such expenses. The Federal contribution to such expenses of planning may be provided entirely from funds authorized under this section or in combination with funds provided under other Federal or Federal grant-in-aid programs. Notwithstanding any provision of law limiting the Federal share in any such other program, funds appropriated to carry out this section may be used to increase such Federal share to the maximum percentage cost thereof authorized by this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:11 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) In order to provide for the further development of the Appalachian region's human resources, grants under this section shall give special emphasis to programs and research for the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of occupational diseases arising from coal mining, such as black lung.</p>

In the case of any program or project for which all or any portion of the basic Federal contribution to the project under a Federal grant-in-aid program is proposed to be made under this subsection, no such Federal contribution shall be made until the responsible Federal official administering the Federal grant-in-aid Act authorizing such contribution certifies that such program or project meets the applicable requirements of such Federal grant-in-aid Act and could be approved for Federal contribution under such Act if funds were available under such Act for such program or project. Funds may be provided for programs and projects in a State under this subsection only if the Commission determines that the level of Federal and State financial assistance under Acts other than this Act, for the same type of programs or projects in that portion of the State within the region, will not be diminished in order to substitute funds authorized by this subsection. Funds provided pursuant to this Act shall be available without regard to any limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for appropriation in any other Act. Any findings, report, certification, or documentation required to be submitted to the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government responsible for the administration of any Federal grant-in-aid programs shall be accepted by the Federal Cochairman with respect to a supplemental grant for any project under such program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No State and no political subdivision of such State shall be eligible to receive benefits under this Act unless the aggregate expenditures of State funds, exclusive of expenditures for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, and exclusive of local funds and Federal funds, for the benefit of the area within the State located in the region are maintained at a level which does not fall below the average level of such expenditures for its last two full fiscal years preceding the date of enactment of this Act. In computing the average level of expenditure for its last two fiscal years, a State's past expenditure for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and expenditures of local funds and Federal funds shall not be included. The Commission shall recommend to the President or such Federal officer or officers as the President may designate, a lesser requirement when it finds that a substantial population decrease in that portion of a State which lies within the region would not justify a State expenditure equal to the average level of the last two years or when it finds that a State's average level of expenditure, within an individual program, has been disproportionate to the present need for that portion of the State which lies within the region.</p>

The State development plan shall reflect the goals, objectives, and priorities identified in the regional development plan and in any subregional development plan which may be approved for the subregion of which such State is a part. Such State development plan shall (1) describe the State organization and continuous process for Appalachian development planning, including the procedures established by the State for the participation of local development districts in such process, the means by which such process is related to overall statewide planning and budgeting processes, and the method of coordinating planning and projects in the region under this Act, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, and other Federal, State, and local programs; (2) set forth the goals, objectives, and priorities of the State for the region, as determined by the Governor, and identify the needs on which such goals, objectives, and priorities are based; and (3) describe the development program for achieving such goals, objectives, and priorities, including funding sources, and recommendations for specific projects to receive assistance under this Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Local development districts certified by the State under section 301 of this Act provide the linkage between State and substate planning and development. In carrying out the development planning process, including the selection of programs and projects for assistance, States shall consult with local development districts, local units of government, and citizen groups and take into consideration the goals, objectives, priorities, and recommendations of such bodies. The districts shall assist the States in the coordination of areawide programs and projects, and may prepare and adopt areawide plans or action programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall encourage the preparation and execution of areawide action programs which specify interrelated projects and schedules of actions together with the necessary agency fundings and other commitments to implement such programs.
