<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) When Required: </strong>Except as otherwise required by these Rules or directed by the Court, all pleadings, motions, orders, decisions, notices, demands, briefs, appearances, or other similar documents or papers relating to a case, including a disciplinary matter under Rule 202, also referred to as the papers in a case, shall be served on each of the parties or other persons involved in the matter to which the paper relates other than the party who filed the paper.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Manner of Service:</strong> (1) <em>General: </em>All petitions shall be served by the Clerk. All other papers required to be served on a party shall also be served by the Clerk unless otherwise provided in these Rules or directed by the Court, or unless the original paper is filed with a certificate by a party or a party's counsel that service of that paper has been made on the party to be served or such party's counsel. For the form of such certificate of service, see Form 13, Appendix I. Such service may be made by mail directed to the party or the party's counsel at such person's last known address. Service by mail is complete upon mailing, and the date of such mailing shall be the date of such service. As an alternative to service by mail, service may be made by delivery to a party, or a party's counsel or authorized representative in the case of a party other than an individual (see Rule 24(b)). Service shall be made on the Commissioner by service on, or directed to, the Commissioner's counsel at the office address shown in the Commissioner's answer filed in the case or, if no answer has been filed, on the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. 20224. Service on a person other than a party shall be made in the same manner as service on a party, except as otherwise provided in these Rules or directed by the Court. In cases consolidated pursuant to Rule 141, a party making direct service of a paper shall serve each of the other parties or counsel for each of the other parties, and the original and copies thereof required to be filed with the Court shall each have a certificate of service attached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Counsel of Record: </em>Whenever under these Rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party represented by counsel who has entered an appearance, service shall be made upon such counsel unless service upon the party is directed by the Court. Where more than one counsel appear for a party, service will be made only on that counsel whose appearance was first entered of record, unless that counsel notifies the Court, by a designation of counsel to receive service filed with the Court, that other counsel of record is to receive service, in which event service will be made only on the person so designated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Writs and Process: </em>Service and execution of writs, process, or similar directives of the Court may be made by a United States marshal, by a deputy marshal, or by a person specially appointed by the Court for that purpose, except that a subpoena may be served as provided in Rule 147(c). The person making service shall make proof thereof to the Court promptly and in any event within the time in which the person served must respond. Failure to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Change of Address: </em>The Court shall be promptly notified, by a notice of change of address filed with the Court, of the change of mailing address of any party, any party's counsel, or any party's duly authorized representative in the case of a party other than an individual (see Rule 24(a)(2),(3), and (b)). A separate notice of change of address shall be filed for each docket number.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 24. Appearance and Representation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Appearance:</strong> (1) <em>General: </em>Counsel may enter an appearance either by subscribing the petition or other initial pleading or document in accordance with subparagraph (2) hereof, or thereafter by filing an entry of appearance in accordance with subparagraph (3) hereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Appearance in Initial Pleading: </em>If (A) the petition or other paper initiating the participation of a party in a case is subscribed by counsel admitted to practice before the Court, and (B) such initial paper contains the mailing address and Tax Court bar number of counsel and other information required for entry of appearance (see subparagraph (3)), then (C) that counsel shall be recognized as representing that party and no separate entry of appearance shall be necessary. Thereafter counsel shall be required to notify the Clerk of any changes in applicable information to the same extent as if counsel had filed a separate entry of appearance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Subsequent Appearance: </em>Where counsel has not previously appeared, counsel shall file an entry of appearance in duplicate, signed by counsel individually, containing the name and docket number of the case, the name, mailing address, telephone number, and Tax Court bar number of counsel so appearing, and a statement that counsel is admitted to practice before the Court. A separate entry of appearance, in duplicate, shall be filed for each additional docket number in which counsel shall appear. The entry of appearance shall be substantially in the form set forth in Appendix I. The Clerk shall be given prompt written notice, filed in duplicate for each docket number, of any change in the foregoing information. An entry of appearance shall not be joined to or made part of a motion to withdraw as counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Counsel Not Admitted to Practice: </em>No entry of appearance by counsel not admitted to practice before this Court will be effective until counsel shall have been admitted, but counsel may be recognized as counsel in a pending case to the extent permitted by the Court and then only where it appears that counsel can and will be promptly admitted. For the procedure for admission to practice before the Court, see Rule 200.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Personal Representation Without Counsel: </strong>In the absence of appearance by counsel, a party will be deemed to appear on the party's own behalf. An individual party may represent himself or herself. A corporation or an unincorporated association may be represented by an authorized officer of the corporation or by an authorized member of the association. An estate or trust may be represented by a fiduciary thereof. Any such person shall state, in the initial pleading or other paper filed by or for the party, such person's name, address, and telephone number, and thereafter shall promptly notify the Clerk in writing, in duplicate for each docket number involving that party, of any change in that information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Withdrawal of Counsel: </strong>Counsel of record desiring to withdraw such counsel's appearance, <!-- PDFPage:6 -->or any party desiring to withdraw the appearance of counsel of record for such party, must file a motion with the Court requesting leave therefor, showing that prior notice of the motion has been given by such counsel to such counsel's client, or such party's counsel, as the case may be, and to each of the other parties to the case or their counsel, and stating whether there is any objection to the motion. A motion to withdraw as counsel and a motion to withdraw counsel shall each also state the then current mailing address and telephone number of the party in respect of whom or by whom the motion is filed. A motion to withdraw as counsel shall not be joined to or made part of an entry of appearance. The Court may, in its discretion, deny such motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Death of Counsel: </strong>If counsel of record dies, the Court shall be so notified, and other counsel may enter an appearance in accordance with this Rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Change in Party or Authorized Representative or Fiduciary: </strong>Where (1) a party other than an individual participates in a case through an authorized representative (such as an officer of a corporation or a member of an association) or through a fiduciary, and there is a change in such representative or fiduciary, or (2) there is a substitution of parties in a pending case, counsel subscribing the motion resulting in the Court's approval of the change or substitution shall thereafter be deemed first counsel of record for the representative, fiduciary, or party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Conflict of Interest: </strong>If any counsel of record (1) was involved in planning or promoting a transaction or operating an entity that is connected to any issue in a case, (2) represents more than one person with differing interests with respect to any issue in a case, or (3) is a potential witness in a case, then such counsel must either secure the informed consent of the client (but only as to items (1) and (2)); withdraw from the case; or take whatever other steps are necessary to obviate a conflict of interest or other violation of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and particularly Rules 1.7, 1.8, and 3.7 thereof. The Court may inquire into the circumstances of counsel's employment in order to deter such violations. See Rule 201.</p>

If service is made by mail, then a period of time computed with respect to the service shall begin on the day after the date of mailing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays: </em>Saturdays, Sundays, and all legal holidays shall be counted, except that, (A) if the period prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, then intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in the District of Columbia shall be excluded in the computation; (B) if the last day of the period so computed is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, then that day shall not be included and the period shall run until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a legal holiday; and (C) if any act is required to be taken or completed no later than (or at least) a specified number of days before a date certain, then the earliest day of the period so specified shall not be included if it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, and the earliest such day shall be the next preceding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or such a legal holiday. When such a legal holiday falls on a Sunday, the next day shall be considered a holiday; and, when such a legal holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding day shall be considered a holiday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Cross-references: </em>For computation of the period within which to file a petition with the Court to redetermine a deficiency or liability, see Code Section 6213; for the period within which to file a petition in a declaratory judgment action, see Code Sections 7428, 7476, and 7478; for the period within which to file a petition in a disclosure action, see Code Section 6110; and for the period within which to file a petition in a partnership action, see Code Sections 6226 and 6228.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Enlargement or Reduction of Time: </strong>Unless precluded by statute, the Court in its discretion may make longer or shorter any period provided by these Rules. As to continuances, see Rule 134. Where a motion is made concerning jurisdiction or the sufficiency of a pleading, the time for filing a response to that pleading shall begin to run from the date of service of the order disposing of the motion by the Court, unless the Court shall direct otherwise. Where the dates for filing briefs are fixed, an extension of time for filing a brief or the granting of leave to file a brief after the due date shall correspondingly extend the time for filing any other brief due at the same time and for filing succeeding briefs, unless the Court shall order otherwise. The period fixed by statute, within which to file a petition with the Court to redetermine a deficiency or liability, cannot be extended by the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Miscellaneous: </strong>With respect to the computation of time, see also Rule 3(e) (definition), Rule 10(d) (business hours of the Court), Rule 13(c) (filing of petition), and Rule 134 (continuances).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Pleading To Be Concise and Direct: </strong>Each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. No technical forms of pleading are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Consistency: </strong>A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them would be sufficient if made independently, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency or the grounds on which based. All statements shall be made subject to the signature requirements of Rules 23(a)(3) and 33.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Caption; Names of Parties: </strong>Every pleading shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the Court (United States Tax Court), the title of the case, the docket number after it becomes available (see Rule 35), and a designation to show the nature of the pleading. In the petition, the title of the case shall include the names of all parties, but shall not include as a party-petitioner the name of any person other than the person or persons by or on whose behalf the petition is filed. In other pleadings, it is sufficient to state the name of the first party with an appropriate indication of other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Separate Statement: </strong>All averments of claim or defense, and all statements in support thereof, shall be made in separately designated paragraphs, the contents of each of which shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single item or a single set of circumstances. Such paragraph may be referred to by that designation in all succeeding pleadings. Each claim and defense shall be stated separately whenever a separation facilitates the clear presentation of the matters set forth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Adoption by Reference; Exhibits: </strong>Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or in another pleading or in any motion. A copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Signature: </strong>Each pleading shall be signed in the manner provided in Rule 23. Where there is more than one attorney of record, the signature of only one is required. Except when otherwise specifically directed by the Court, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Effect of Signature: </strong>The signature of counsel or a party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the pleading, that, to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. The signature of counsel also constitutes a representation by counsel that counsel is authorized to represent the party or parties on whose behalf the pleading is filed. If a pleading is not signed, it shall be stricken, unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader. If a pleading is signed in violation of this Rule, the Court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, including reasonable counsel's fees. </p>

Ordinarily, a separate petition shall be filed with respect to each notice of deficiency or each notice of liability. However, a single petition may be filed seeking a redetermination with respect to all notices of deficiency or liability directed to one person alone or to such person and one or more other persons or to a husband and a wife individually, except that the Court may require a severance and a separate case to be maintained with respect to one or more of such notices. Where the notice of deficiency or liability is directed to more than one person, each such person desiring to contest it shall file a petition, either separately or jointly with any such other person, and each such person must satisfy all the requirements of this Rule in order for the petition to be treated as filed by or for such person. The petition shall be complete, so as to enable ascertainment of the issues intended to be presented. No telegram, cablegram, radiogram, telephone call, electronically transmitted copy, or similar communication will be recognized as a petition. Failure of the petition to satisfy applicable requirements may be ground for dismissal of the case. As to the joinder of parties, see Rule 61; and as to the effect of misjoinder of parties, see Rule 62. For the circumstances under which a timely mailed petition will be treated <!-- PDFPage:8 -->as having been timely filed, see Code Section 7502.</p>

The mailing address, legal residence, principal place of business, or principal office or agency shall be stated as of the date of filing the petition. In the event of a variance between the name set forth in the notice of deficiency or liability and the correct name, a statement of the reasons for such variance shall be set forth in the petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The date of the notice of deficiency or liability, or other proper allegations showing jurisdiction in the Court, and the City and State of the office of the Internal Revenue Service which issued the notice.</p>

The assignments of error shall include issues in respect of which the burden of proof is on the Commissioner. Any issue not raised in the assignment of errors shall be deemed to be conceded. Each assignment of error shall be separately lettered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Clear and concise lettered statements of the facts on which petitioner bases the assignments of error, except with respect to those assignments of error as to which the burden of proof is on the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A prayer setting forth relief sought by the petitioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The signature, mailing address, and telephone number of each petitioner or each petitioner's counsel, as well as counsel's Tax Court bar number.</p>

If the notice of deficiency or liability or accompanying statement incorporates by reference any prior notices, or other material furnished by the Internal Revenue Service, such parts thereof as are material to the issues raised by the assignments of error likewise shall be appended to the petition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A claim for reasonable litigation or administrative costs shall not be included in the petition in a deficiency or liability action. For the requirements as to claims for reasonable litigation or administrative costs, see Rule 231.</p>

If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to which the adverse party is not required to file a responsive pleading, then such party may assert at the trial any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Amendments: </strong>A party may amend a pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served. If the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the case has not been placed on a trial calendar, then a party may so amend it at any time within 30 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend a pleading only by leave of Court or by written consent of the adverse party, and leave shall be given freely when justice so requires. No amendment shall be allowed after expiration of the time for filing the petition, however, which would involve conferring jurisdiction on the Court over a matter which otherwise would not come within its jurisdiction under the petition as then on file. A motion for leave to amend a pleading shall state the reasons for the amendment and shall be accompanied by the proposed amendment. The amendment to the pleading shall not be incorporated into the motion but rather shall be separately set forth and consistent with the requirements of Rule 23 regarding form and style of papers filed with the Court. See Rules 36(a) and 37(a) for time for responding to amended pleadings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Amendments to Conform to the Evidence:</strong> (1) <em>Issues Tried by Consent: </em>When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. The Court, upon motion of any party at any time, may allow such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues, but failure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Other Evidence: </em>If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the <!-- PDFPage:10 -->issues raised by pleadings, then the Court may receive the evidence and at any time allow the pleadings to be amended to conform to the proof, and shall do so freely when justice so requires and the objecting party fails to satisfy the Court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice such party in maintaining such party's position on the merits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Filing: </em>The amendment or amended pleadings permitted under this paragraph (b) shall be filed with the Court at the trial or shall be filed with the Clerk at Washington, D.C., within such time as the Court may fix.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Supplemental Pleadings: </strong>Upon motion of a party, the Court may, upon such terms as are just, permit a party to file a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions or occurrences or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Permission may be granted even though the original pleading is defective in its statements of a claim for relief or defense. If the Court deems it advisable that the adverse party plead to the supplemental pleading, then it shall so direct, specifying the time therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Relation Back of Amendments: </strong>When an amendment of a pleading is permitted, it shall relate back to the time of filing of that pleading, unless the Court shall order otherwise either on motion of a party or on its own initiative.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Form and Content of Motion: </strong>An application to the Court for an order shall be by motion in writing, which shall state with particularity the grounds therefor and shall set forth the relief or order sought. The motion shall show that prior notice thereof has been given to each other party or counsel for each other party and shall state whether there is any objection to the motion. If a motion does not include such a statement, the Court will assume that there is an objection to the motion. Unless the Court directs otherwise, motions made during a hearing or trial need not be in writing. The rules applicable to captions, signing, and other matters of form and style of pleadings apply to all written motions. See Rules 23, 32, and 33.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Disposition of Motions: </strong>A motion may be disposed of in one or more of the following ways, in the discretion of the Court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Court may take action after directing that a written response be filed. In that event, the motion shall be served upon the opposing party, who shall file such response within such period as the Court may direct. Written response to a motion shall conform to the same requirements of form and style as apply to motions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Court may take action after directing a hearing, which normally will be held in Washington, D.C. The Court may, on its own motion or upon the written request of any party to the motion, direct that the hearing be held at some other location which serves the convenience of the parties and the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Court may take such action as the Court in its discretion deems appropriate, on such prior notice, if any, which the Court may consider reasonable. The action of the Court may be taken with or without written response, hearing, or attendance of a party to the motion at the hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Attendance at Hearings: </strong>If a motion is noticed for hearing, then a party to the motion may, prior to or at the time for such hearing, submit a written statement of such party's position together with any supporting documents. Such statement may be submitted in lieu of or in addition to attendance at the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Defects in Pleading: </strong>Where the motion or order is directed to defects in a pleading, prompt filing of a proper pleading correcting the defects may obviate the necessity of a hearing thereon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Postponement of Trial: </strong>The filing of a motion shall not constitute cause for postponement of a trial. With respect to motions for continuance, see Rule 134.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Service of Motions: </strong>The rules applicable to service of pleadings apply to service of motions. See Rule 21.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Petitioner:</strong> (1) <em>Deficiency or Liability Actions: </em>A case shall be brought by and in the name of the person against whom the Commissioner determined the deficiency (in the case of a notice of deficiency) or liability (in the case of a notice of liability), or by and with the full descriptive name of the fiduciary entitled to institute a case on behalf of such person. See Rule 23(a)(1). A case timely brought shall not be dismissed on the ground that it is not properly brought on behalf of a party until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for ratification by such party of the bringing of the case; and such ratification shall have the same effect as if the case had been properly brought by such party. Where the deficiency or liability is determined against more than one person in the notice by the Commissioner, only such of those persons who shall duly act to bring a case shall be deemed a party or parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Other Actions: </em>For the person who may bring a case as a petitioner in a declaratory judgment action, see Rules 210(b)(11), 211, and 216. For the person who may bring a case as a petitioner in a disclosure action, see Rules 220(b)(5), 221, and 225. For the person who may bring a case as a petitioner in a partnership action, see Rules 240(c)(1)(B), 240(c)(2)(B), 241, and 245. For the person who may bring a case as a petitioner in an action for administrative costs, see Rule 271.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Respondent: </strong>The Commissioner shall be named the respondent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Capacity: </strong>The capacity of an individual, other than one acting in a fiduciary or other representative capacity, to engage in litigation in the Court shall be determined by the law of the individual's domicile. The capacity of a corporation to engage in such litigation shall be determined by the law under which it was organized. The capacity of a fiduciary or other representative to litigate in the Court shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction from which such person's authority is derived.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Infants or Incompetent Persons: </strong>Whenever an infant or incompetent person has a representative, such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or other like fiduciary, the representative may bring a case or defend in the Court on behalf of the infant or incompetent person. An infant or incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may act by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. Where a party attempts to represent himself or herself and, in the opinion of the Court there is a serious question as to such party's competence to do so, the Court, if it deems justice so requires, may continue the case until appropriate steps have been taken to obtain an adjudication of the question by a court having jurisdiction so to do, or may take such other action as it deems proper.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 70. General Provisions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> (1) <em>Methods and Limitations of Discovery: </em>In conformity with these Rules, a party may obtain discovery by written interrogatories (Rule 71), by production of documents or things (Rules 72 and 73), by depositions upon consent of the parties (Rule 74), by depositions without consent of the parties in certain cases (Rule 75), or by depositions of expert witnesses (Rule 76). However, the Court expects the parties to attempt to attain the objectives of discovery through informal consultation or communication before utilizing the discovery procedures provided in these Rules. Discovery is not available under these Rules through depositions except to the limited extent provided in Rules 74, 75, and 76. See Rules 91(a) and 100 regarding relationship of discovery to stipulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Time for Discovery: </em>Discovery shall not be commenced, without leave of Court, before the expiration of 30 days after joinder of issue (see Rule 38), and shall be completed, unless otherwise authorized by the Court, no later than 45 days prior to the date set for call of the case from a trial calendar. Discovery by a deposition under Rules 75 and 76 may not be commenced before a notice of trial has been issued or the case has been assigned to a Judge or Special Trial Judge and shall be completed within the time provided by the preceding sentence. See Rules 75(a) and 76(c). Discovery of matters which are relevant only to the issue of a party's entitlement to reasonable litigation or administrative costs shall not be commenced, without leave of Court, before a motion for reasonable litigation or administrative costs has been noticed for a hearing, and shall be completed, unless otherwise authorized by the Court, no later than 45 days prior to the date set for hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Cases Consolidated for Trial: </em>With respect to a common matter in cases consolidated for trial, discovery may be had by any party to such a case to the extent provided by these Rules, and, for that purpose, the reference to a &ldquo;party&rdquo; in this Title VII, in Title VIII, or in Title X, shall mean any party to any of the consolidated cases involving such common matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Scope of Discovery:</strong> (1) The information or response sought through discovery may concern any matter not privileged and which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending case. It is not ground for objection that the information or response sought will be inadmissible at the trial, if that information or response appears reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence, regardless of the burden of proof involved. If the information or response sought is otherwise proper, it is not objectionable merely because the information or response involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or to the application of law to fact. But the Court may order that the information or response sought need not be furnished or made until some designated time or a particular stage has been reached in the case or until a specified step has been taken by a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods set forth in paragraph (a) shall be limited by the Court if it determines that: (A) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (B) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought, or (C) the discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on the parties&rsquo; resources, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. The Court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable notice or pursuant to a motion under Rule 103.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Party's Statements: </strong>Upon request to the other party and without any showing except the assertion in writing that the requestor lacks and has no convenient means of obtaining a copy of a statement made by the requestor, a party shall be entitled to obtain a copy of any such statement which has a bearing on the subject matter of the case and is in the possession or control of another party to the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Use in Case: </strong>The answers to interrogatories, things produced in response to a request, or other information or responses obtained under Rules 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, and 76, may be used at trial or in any proceeding in the case prior or subsequent to trial to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence. Such answers or information or responses will not be considered <!-- PDFPage:15 -->as evidence until offered and received as evidence. No objections to interrogatories or the answers thereto, or to a request to produce or the response thereto, will be considered unless made within the time prescribed, except that the objection that an interrogatory or answer would be inadmissible at trial is preserved even though not made prior to trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Signing of Discovery Requests, Responses, and Objections:</strong> (1) Every request for discovery or response or objection thereto made by a party represented by counsel shall be signed by at least one counsel of record. A party who is not represented by counsel shall sign the request, response, or objection. The signature shall conform to the requirements of Rule 23(a)(3). The signature of counsel or a party constitutes a certification that the signer has read the request, response, or objection, and that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry, it is (A) consistent with these Rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, (B) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation, and (C) not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken, unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a certification is made in violation of this Rule, then the Court upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose behalf the request, response, or objection is made, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including reasonable counsel's fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Other Applicable Rules: </strong>For Rules concerned with the frequency and timing of discovery in relation to other procedures, supplementation of answers, protective orders, effect of evasive or incomplete answers or responses, and sanctions and enforcement action, see Title X.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Availability: </strong>Any party may, without leave of Court, serve upon any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency, by an officer or agent who shall furnish such information as is available to the party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Answers: </strong>All answers shall be made in good faith and as completely as the answering party's information shall permit. However, the answering party is required to make reasonable inquiry and ascertain readily obtainable information. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as an answer or as a reason for failure to answer, unless such party states that such party has made reasonable inquiry and that information known or readily obtainable by such party is insufficient to enable such party to answer the substance of the interrogatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Procedure: </strong>Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for the objection shall be stated in lieu of the answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them and the objections shall be signed by the party or the party's counsel. The party, on whom the interrogatories have been served, shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, upon the propounding party within 45 days after service of the interrogatories. The Court may allow a shorter or longer time. The burden shall be on the party submitting the interrogatories to move for an order with respect to any objection or other failure to answer an interrogatory, and in that connection the moving party shall annex the interrogatories to the motion, with proof of service on the other party, together with the answers and objections, if any. Prior to moving for such an order, neither the interrogatories nor the response shall be filed with the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Experts:</strong> (1) By means of written interrogatories in conformity with this Rule, a party may require any other party (A) to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at the trial of the case, giving the witness&rsquo; name, address, vocation or occupation, and a statement of the witness&rsquo; qualifications, and (B) to state the subject matter and the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify, and give a summary of the grounds for each such opinion, or, in lieu of such statement to furnish a copy of a report of such expert presenting the foregoing information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For provisions regarding the submission and exchange of expert witness reports, see Rule 143(f). That Rule shall not serve to extend the period of time under paragraph (c) of this Rule within which a party must answer any interrogatory directed at discovering (A) the identity and qualifications of each person whom such party expects to call as an expert witness at the trial of the case and (B) the subject matter with respect to which the expert is expected to testify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Option to Produce Business Records: </strong>Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served, or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, or from a compilation, abstract, or summary based thereon, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General: </strong>Upon application to the Court and subject to these Rules, a transferee of property of a taxpayer shall be entitled to examine before trial the books, papers, documents, correspondence, and other evidence of the taxpayer or of a preceding transferee of the taxpayer's property, but only if the transferee making the application is a petitioner seeking redetermination of such transferee's liability in respect of the taxpayer's tax liability (including interest, additional amounts, and additions provided by law). Such books, papers, documents, correspondence, and other evidence may be made available to the extent that the same shall be within the United States, will not result in undue hardship to the taxpayer or preceding transferee, and in the opinion of the Court is necessary in order to enable the transferee to ascertain the liability of the taxpayer or preceding transferee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure: </strong>A petitioner desiring an examination permitted under paragraph (a) shall file an application with the Court, showing that such petitioner is entitled to such an examination, describing the documents and other materials sought to be examined, giving the names and addresses of the persons to produce the same, and stating a reasonable time and place where the examination is to be made. If the Court shall determine that the applicable requirements are satisfied, then it shall issue a subpoena, signed by a Judge, directed to the appropriate person and ordering the production at a designated time and place of the documents and other materials involved. If the person to whom the subpoena is directed shall object thereto or to the production involved, then such person shall file the objections and the reasons therefor in writing with the Court, and serve a copy thereof upon the applicant, within 10 days after service of the subpoena or on or before such earlier time as may be specified in the subpoena for compliance. To obtain a ruling on such objections, the applicant for the subpoena shall file an appropriate motion with the Court. In all respects not inconsistent with the provisions of this Rule, the provisions of Rule 72(b) shall apply where appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Scope of Examination: </strong>The scope of the examination authorized under this Rule shall be as broad as is authorized under Rule 72(a), including, for example, the copying of such documents and materials.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Depositions in Pending Cases: </strong>Upon consent of all the parties to a case, and within the time limits provided in Rule 70(a)(2), a deposition for discovery purposes may be taken either of a party or a non-party witness. Such consent shall be set forth in a stipulation filed in duplicate with the Court, which shall contain the information required in Rule 81(d) and which otherwise shall be subject to the procedure provided in Rule 81(d). Unless the Court shall determine otherwise for good cause shown, the taking of such a deposition will not be regarded as sufficient ground for granting a continuance from a date or place of trial theretofore set.</p>

The notice shall state that the deposition is to be taken under Rule 74 and shall set forth the name of the party or parties seeking the deposition, the time and place proposed for the deposition, and the name of the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken. If the deposition is to be taken on written questions, then a copy of the written questions shall be annexed to the notice. With respect to the deposition of an organization described in Rule 81(c), the notice shall also set forth the information required under that Rule, and the organization shall make the designation authorized by that Rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Objection by Non-Party Witness: </strong>Within 15 days after service of the notice of deposition, a non-party witness shall serve on the parties <!-- PDFPage:17 -->seeking the deposition any objections to the deposition. The burden shall be upon a party seeking the deposition to move for an order with respect to such objection or other failure of the non-party witness, and such party shall annex to any such motion the notice of deposition with proof of service thereof, together with a copy of the response and objections, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Transcript: </strong>A transcript shall be made of every deposition taken under this Rule, but the transcript and exhibits introduced in connection with the deposition shall not be filed with the Court. See Rule 81(h)(3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Availability: </strong>The taking of a deposition of a non-party witness under this Rule is an extraordinary method of discovery and may be used only where a non-party witness can give testimony or possesses documents or things which are discoverable within the meaning of Rule 70(b) and where such testimony, documents, or things practicably cannot be obtained through informal consultation or communication (Rule 70(a)(1)) or by a deposition taken with consent of the parties (Rule 74). If such requirements are satisfied, then a deposition may be taken under this Rule, for example, where a party is a member of a partnership and an issue in the case involves an adjustment with respect to such partnership, or a party is a shareholder of an electing small business corporation (as described in Code Section 1371(b) prior to the enactment of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982), and an issue in the case involves an adjustment with respect to such corporation. See Title XXIV, relating to partnership actions, brought under provisions first enacted by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Notice: </strong>A party desiring to take a deposition under this Rule shall give notice in writing to every other party to the case and to the non-party witness to be deposed. The notice shall state that the deposition is to be taken under Rule 75 and shall set forth the name of the party seeking the deposition, the name and address of the person to be deposed, the time and place proposed for the deposition, and the officer before whom the deposition is to be taken. If the deposition is to be taken on written questions, a copy of the questions shall be annexed to the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Objections: </strong>Within 15 days after service of the notice of deposition, a party or a non-party witness shall serve on the party seeking the deposition any objections to the deposition.

Prior to moving for such an order, neither the notice nor the responses shall be filed with the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Other Applicable Rules: </strong>Depositions for discovery purposes under this Rule shall be governed by the provisions of the following Rules with respect to the matters to which they apply: Rule 74(d) (transcript), 74(e) (depositions upon written questions), Rule 81(c) (designation of person to testify), 81(e) (person before whom deposition taken), 81(f) (taking of deposition), 81(g) (expenses), 81(h) (execution, form, and return of deposition), 81(i) (use of deposition), and Rule 85(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) (objections and irregularities).

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) When Deposition May Be Taken: </strong>A deposition of an expert witness under paragraph (a)(2) of this Rule may be taken only after a notice of trial has been issued or after a case has been assigned to a Judge or Special Trial Judge of the Court, and within the time for completion of discovery under Rule 70(a)(2). The taking of such a deposition ordinarily will not be regarded as a ground for continuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Procedure:</strong> (1) <em>In General: </em>A party desiring to depose an expert witness under paragraph (a)(2) of this Rule shall file a written motion and shall set forth therein the matters specified in subparagraph (2). The Court shall take such action on the motion as it deems appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Other Use: </em>Any other use of a deposition of an expert witness shall be governed by the provisions of Rule 81(i).</p>

A deposition taken pursuant to a stipulation shall in all respects conform to the requirements of these Rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Person Before Whom Deposition Taken:</strong> (1) <em>Domestic Depositions: </em>Within the United States or a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States (see Code Section 7622) or of the place where the examination is held, or before a person appointed by the Court.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Foreign Depositions: </em>In a foreign country, depositions may be taken (A) before a person authorized to administer oaths or affirmations in the place in which the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of the United States, or (B) before a person commissioned by the Court, and a person so commissioned shall have the power, by virtue of the commission, to administer any necessary oath and take testimony, or (C) pursuant to a letter rogatory or a letter of request issued in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters. A commission, a letter rogatory, or a letter of request shall be issued on application and notice and on terms that are just and appropriate. The party seeking to take a foreign deposition shall contact the United States Department of State to ascertain any requirements imposed by it or by the foreign country in which the deposition is to be taken, including any required foreign language translations and any fees or costs, and shall submit to the Court, along with the application, any such foreign language translations, fees, costs, or other materials required. It is not requisite to the issuance of a commission, a letter rogatory, or a letter of request that the taking of the deposition in any other manner be impracticable or inconvenient; and both a commission and a letter rogatory, or both a commission and a letter of request, may be issued in proper cases. A notice or commission may designate the person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive title. A letter rogatory may be addressed &ldquo;To the Appropriate Authority in [here name the country].&rdquo; A letter of request is addressed to the central authority of the requested State. The model recommended for letters of request is set forth in the Hague Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters, 23 U.S.T. 2555, T.I.A.S. No. 7444. Evidence obtained by deposition or in response to a letter rogatory or a letter of request need not be excluded merely for the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that the testimony was not taken under oath or for any similar departure from the requirements for depositions within the United States under these Rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Disqualification for Interest: </em>No deposition shall be taken before a person who is a relative or employee or counsel of any party, or is a relative or employee or associate of such counsel, or is financially interested in the action. However, on consent of all the parties or their counsel, a deposition may be taken before such person, but only if the relationship of that person and the waiver are set forth in the certificate of return to the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Taking of Deposition:</strong> (1) <em>Arrangements: </em>All arrangements necessary for taking of the deposition shall be made by the party filing the application or, in the case of a stipulation, by such other persons as may be agreed upon by the parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Procedure: </em>Attendance by the persons to be examined may be compelled by the issuance of a subpoena, and production likewise may be compelled of exhibits required in connection with the testimony being taken. The officer before whom the deposition is taken shall first put the witness on oath (or affirmation) and shall personally, or by someone acting under such officer's direction and in such officer's presence, record accurately and verbatim the questions asked, the answers given, the objections made, and all matters transpiring at the taking of the deposition which bear on the testimony involved. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses, and the marking of exhibits, shall proceed as permitted at trial. All objections made at the time of examination shall be noted by the officer upon the deposition. Evidence objected to, unless privileged, shall be taken subject to the objections made. If an answer is improperly refused and as a result a further deposition is taken by the interrogating party, the objecting party or deponent may be required to pay all costs, charges, and expenses of that deposition to the same extent as is provided in paragraph (g) of this Rule where a party seeking to take a deposition fails to appear at the taking of the deposition. At the request of either party, a prospective witness at the deposition, other than a person acting in an expert or advisory capacity for a party, shall be excluded from the room in which, and during the time that, the testimony of another witness is being taken; and if such person remains in the room or within hearing of the examination after such request has been made, such person shall not thereafter be permitted to testify, except by the consent of the party who requested such person's exclusion or by permission of the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Expenses:</strong> (1) <em>General: </em>The party taking the deposition shall pay all the expenses, fees, and charges of the witness whose deposition is taken by such party, any charges of the officer presiding at or recording the deposition other than for copies of the deposition, and any expenses involved in providing a place for the deposition. <!-- PDFPage:21 -->The party taking the deposition shall pay for the original of the deposition; and, upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the officer shall also furnish a copy of the deposition to any party or the deponent. By stipulation between the parties or on order of the Court, provision may be made for any costs, charges, or expenses relating to the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Failure to Attend or to Serve Subpoena: </em>If the party authorized to take a deposition fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party attends in person or by attorney pursuant to the arrangements made, then the Court may order the former party to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by such other party and such other party's attorney in attending, including reasonable attorney's fees. If the party authorized to take a deposition of a witness fails to serve a subpoena upon the witness and the witness because of such failure does not attend, and if another party attends in person or by attorney because such party expects the deposition of that witness to be taken, then the Court may order the former party to pay to such other party the reasonable expenses incurred by such other party and such other party's attorney attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Execution and Return of Deposition:</strong> (1) <em>Submission to Witness; Changes; Signing: </em>When the testimony is fully transcribed, the deposition shall be submitted to the witness for examination and shall be read to or by the witness, unless such examination and reading are waived by the witness and by the parties. Any changes in form or substance, which the witness desires to make, shall be entered upon the deposition by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making them. The deposition shall then be signed by the witness, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the witness within 30 days of its submission to the witness, then the officer shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver or of the illness or absence of the witness or the fact of the refusal to sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor; and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed unless the Court determines that the reasons given for the refusal to sign require rejection of the deposition in whole or in part. As to correction of errors, see Rules 85 and 143(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Form: </em>The deposition shall show the docket number and caption of the case as they appear in the Court's records, the place and date of taking the deposition, the name of the witness, the party by whom called, the names of counsel present and whom they represent. The pages of the deposition shall be securely fastened. Exhibits shall be carefully marked, and when practicable annexed to, and in any event returned with, the deposition, unless, upon motion to the Court, a copy shall be permitted as a substitute after an opportunity is given to all interested parties to examine and compare the original and the copy. The officer shall execute and attach to the deposition a certificate in accordance with Form 7 shown in Appendix I.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Return of Deposition: </em>The deposition and exhibits shall not be filed with the Court. Unless otherwise directed by the Court, the officer shall deliver the original deposition and exhibits to the party taking the deposition or such party's counsel, who shall take custody of and be responsible for the safeguarding of the original deposition and exhibits. Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the officer also shall deliver a copy of the deposition and exhibits to any party or the deponent, or to counsel for any party or for the deponent. As to use of a deposition at the trial or in any other proceeding in the case, see paragraph (i) of this Rule. As to introduction of a deposition in evidence, see Rule 143(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(i) Use of Deposition: </strong>At the trial or in any other proceeding in the case, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The deposition of a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The deposition may be used for any purpose if the Court finds: (A) that the witness is dead; or (B) that the witness is at such distance from the place of trial that it is not practicable for the witness to attend, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party seeking to use the deposition; or (C) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (D) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to obtain attendance of the witness at the trial, as to make it desirable in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used; or (E) that such exceptional circumstances exist, in regard to the absence of the witness at the trial, as to make it desirable in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, then an adverse party may require the party offering the deposition to introduce any other part which ought in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">As to introduction of a deposition in evidence, see Rule 143(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(j) Videotape Depositions:</strong> (1) <em>General: </em>By stipulation of the parties or upon order of the Court, a deposition to perpetuate testimony to be taken upon oral examination may be recorded by videotape. Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, all other provisions of these Rules governing the practice and procedure in depositions shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Procedure: </em>The deposition shall begin by the operator stating on camera (A) the operator's name and address, (B) the name and address of the operator's employer, (C) the date, time, and place of the deposition, (D) the caption and docket number of the case, (E) the name of the witness, and (F) the party on whose behalf the deposition is being taken. The officer before <!-- PDFPage:22 -->whom the deposition is taken shall then identify himself or herself and swear the witness on camera. At the conclusion of the deposition, the operator shall state on camera that the deposition is concluded. The officer before whom the deposition is taken and the operator may be the same person. When the length of the deposition requires the use of more than one tape, the end of each tape and the beginning of each succeeding tape shall be announced on camera by the operator. The deposition shall be timed by a digital clock on camera which shall show continually each hour, minute, and second of each tape of the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Transcript: </em>If requested by one of the parties, then the testimony shall be transcribed at the cost of such party; but no signature of the witness shall be required, and the transcript shall not be filed with the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Custody: </em>The party taking the deposition or such party's counsel shall take custody of and be responsible for the safeguarding of the videotape together with any exhibits, and such party shall permit the viewing of or shall provide a copy of the videotape and any exhibits upon the request and at the cost of any other party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <em>Use: </em>A videotape deposition may be used at a trial or hearing in the manner and to the extent provided in paragraph (i) of this Rule. The party who offers the videotape in evidence shall provide all necessary equipment for viewing the videotape and personnel to operate such equipment. At a trial or hearing, that part of the audio portion of a videotape deposition which is offered in evidence and admitted, or which is excluded on objection, shall be transcribed in the same manner as the testimony of other witnesses. The videotape shall be marked as an exhibit and, subject to the provisions of Rule 143(d)(2), shall remain in the custody of the Court.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">A person, who desires to perpetuate testimony or to preserve any document or thing regarding any matter that may be cognizable in this Court, may file an application with the Court to take a deposition for such purpose. The application shall be entitled in the name of the applicant, shall otherwise be in the same style and form as apply to a motion filed with the Court, and shall show the following: (1) The facts showing that the applicant expects to be a party to a case cognizable in this Court but is at present unable to bring it or cause it to be brought. (2) The subject matter of the expected action and the applicant's interest therein. (3) All matters required to be shown in an application under paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 81 except item (H) thereof. Such an application will be entered upon a special docket, and service thereof and pleading with respect thereto will proceed subject to the requirements otherwise applicable to a motion. A hearing on the application may be required by the Court. If the Court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the testimony or the preservation of the document or thing may prevent a failure or delay of justice, then it will make an order authorizing the deposition and including such other terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate consistently with these Rules. If the deposition is taken, and if thereafter the expected case is commenced in this Court, then the deposition may be used in that case subject to the Rules which would apply if the deposition had been taken after commencement of the case.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Use of Written Questions: </strong>A party may make an application to the Court to take a deposition, otherwise authorized under Rules 81, 82, or 83, upon written questions rather than oral examination. The provisions of those Rules shall apply in all respects to such a deposition except to the extent clearly inapplicable or otherwise provided in this Rule. Unless there is special reason for taking the deposition on written questions rather than oral examination, the Court will deny the application, without prejudice to seeking approval of the deposition upon oral examination. The taking of depositions upon written questions is not favored, except when the deposition is to be taken in a foreign country, in which event the deposition must be taken on written questions unless otherwise directed by the Court for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure: </strong>An application under paragraph (a) hereof shall have the written questions annexed thereto. With respect to such application, the 15-day period for filing objections prescribed by paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 81 is extended to 20 days, and within that 20-day period the objecting or responding party shall also file with the Court any cross-questions which such party may desire to be asked at the taking of the deposition. The applicant shall then file any objections to the cross-questions, as well as any redirect questions, within 15 days after service on the applicant of the cross-questions. Within 15 days after service of the redirect questions on the other party, the other party shall file with the Court any objections to the redirect questions, as well as any recross questions which the other party may desire to be asked. No objection to a written question will be considered unless it is filed with the Court within such applicable time. An original and five copies of all questions and objections shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court, who will make service thereof on the opposite party. The Court for good cause shown may enlarge or shorten the time in any respect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Taking of Deposition: </strong>The officer taking the deposition shall propound all questions to the witness in their proper order. The parties and their counsel may attend the taking of the deposition but shall not participate in the deposition proceeding in any manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Execution and Return: </strong>The execution and return of the deposition shall conform to the requirements of paragraph (h) of Rule 81.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) As to Initiating Deposition: </strong>All errors and irregularities in the procedure for obtaining approval for the taking of a deposition are waived, unless made in writing within the time for making objections or promptly where no time is prescribed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) As to Disqualification of Officer: </strong>Objection to taking a deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived, unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) As to Use: </strong>In general, an objection may be made at the trial or hearing to use of a deposition, in whole or in part as evidence, for any reason which would require the exclusion of the testimony as evidence if the witness were then present and testifying. However, objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, if the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) As to Manner and Form: </strong>Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of the parties, and errors of any kind which might have been obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless reasonable objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) As to Errors by Officer: </strong>Errors or irregularities in the manner in which testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, transmitted, filed, or otherwise dealt with by the presiding officer, are waived unless a motion to correct or suppress the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have been, ascertained.

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 90. Requests for Admission</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Scope and Time of Request: </strong>A party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending action only, of the truth of any matters which are not privileged and are relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, but only if such matters are set forth in the request and relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any documents described in the request. However, the Court expects the parties to attempt to attain the objectives of such a request through informal consultation or communication before utilizing the procedures provided in this Rule. Requests for admission must be commenced and completed within the same period provided in Rule 70(a)(2) for commencement and completion of discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) The Request: </strong>The request may, without leave of Court, be served by any party to a pending case. Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. The party making the request shall serve a copy thereof on the other party, and shall file the original with proof of service with the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Response to Request: </strong>Each matter is deemed admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request or within such shorter or longer time as the Court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party (1) a written answer specifically admitting or denying the matter involved in whole or in part, or asserting that it cannot be truthfully admitted or denied and setting forth in detail the reasons why this is so, or (2) an objection, stating in detail the reasons therefor. The response shall be signed by the party or the party's counsel, and the original thereof, with proof of service on the other party, shall be filed with the Court. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and, when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, such party shall specify so much of it as is true and deny or qualify the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless such party states that such party has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by such party is insufficient to enable such party to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter, of which an admission has been requested, presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; such party may, subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this Rule, deny the matter or set forth reasons why such party cannot admit or deny it. An objection on the ground of relevance may be noted by any party but it is not to be regarded as just cause for refusal to admit or deny.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Effect of Signature:</strong> (1) The signature of counsel or a party constitutes a certification that the signer has read the request for admission or response or objection, and that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry, it is (A) consistent with these Rules and warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; (B) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation; and (C) not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation. If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken, unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until it is signed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a certification is made in violation of this Rule, the Court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose be<!-- PDFPage:24 -->half the request, response, or objection is made, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the violation, including reasonable counsel's fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Motion to Review: </strong>The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the Court determines that an objection is justified, it shall order that an answer be served. If the Court determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this Rule, then it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. In lieu of any such order, the Court may determine that final disposition of the request shall be made at some later time which may be more appropriate for disposing of the question involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Effect of Admission: </strong>Any matter admitted under this Rule is conclusively established unless the Court on motion permits withdrawal or modification of the admission. Subject to any other orders made in the case by the Court, withdrawal or modification may be permitted when the presentation of the merits of the case will be subserved thereby, and the party who obtained the admission fails to satisfy the Court that the withdrawal or modification will prejudice such party in prosecuting such party's case or defense on the merits. Any admission made by a party under this Rule is for the purpose of the pending action only and is not an admission by such party for any other purpose, nor may it be used against such party in any other proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(g) Sanctions: </strong>If any party unjustifiably fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested in accordance with this Rule, the party requesting the admission may apply to the Court for an order imposing such sanction on the other party or the other party's counsel as the Court may find appropriate in the circumstances, including but not limited to the sanctions provided in Title X. The failure to admit may be found unjustifiable unless the Court finds that (1) the request was held objectionable pursuant to this Rule, or (2) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to doubt the truth of the matter or the genuineness of the document in respect of which the admission was sought, or (4) there was other good reason for failure to admit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(h) Other Applicable Rules: </strong>For Rules concerned with frequency and timing of requests for admission in relation to other procedures, supplementation of answers, effect of evasive or incomplete answers or responses, protective orders, and sanctions and enforcements, see Title X.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Stipulations Required:</strong> (1) <em>General: </em>The parties are required to stipulate, to the fullest extent to which complete or qualified agreement can or fairly should be reached, all matters not privileged which are relevant to the pending case, regardless of whether such matters involve fact or opinion or the application of law to fact. Included in matters required to be stipulated are all facts, all documents and papers or contents or aspects thereof, and all evidence which fairly should not be in dispute. Where the truth or authenticity of facts or evidence claimed to be relevant by one party is not disputed, an objection on the ground of materiality or relevance may be noted by any other party but is not to be regarded as just cause for refusal to stipulate. The requirement of stipulation applies under this Rule without regard to where the burden of proof may lie with respect to the matters involved. Documents or papers or other exhibits annexed to or filed with the stipulation shall be considered to be part of the stipulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Stipulations to Be Comprehensive:</em> The fact that any matter may have been obtained through discovery or requests for admission or through any other authorized procedure is not grounds for omitting such matter from the stipulation. Such other procedures should be regarded as aids to stipulation, and matter obtained through them which is within the scope of subparagraph (1), must be set forth comprehensively in the stipulation, in logical order in the context of all other provisions of the stipulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Form: </strong>Stipulations required under this Rule shall be in writing, signed by the parties thereto or by their counsel, and shall observe the requirements of Rule 23 as to form and style of papers, except that the stipulation shall be filed with the Court in duplicate and only one set of exhibits shall be required. Documents or other papers, which are the subject of stipulation in any respect and which the parties intend to place before the Court, shall be annexed to or filed with the stipulation. The stipulation shall be clear and concise. Separate items shall be stated in separate paragraphs, and shall be appropriately lettered or numbered. Exhibits attached to a stipulation shall be numbered serially, i.e., 1, 2, 3, etc., if offered by the petitioner, shall be lettered serially, i.e., A, B, C, etc., if offered by the respondent, and shall be marked serially, i.e., 1-A, 2-B, 3-C, etc., if offered as joint exhibits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Filing: </strong>Executed stipulations prepared pursuant to this Rule, and related exhibits, shall be filed by the parties at or before commencement of the trial of the case, unless the Court in the particular case shall otherwise specify. A stipulation when filed need not be offered formally to be considered in evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Objections: </strong>Any objection to all or any part of a stipulation should be noted in the stipulation, but the Court will consider any objection to a stipulated matter made at the commencement of the trial or for good cause shown made during the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Binding Effect: </strong>A stipulation shall be treated, to the extent of its terms, as a conclusive admission by the parties to the stipulation, unless otherwise permitted by the Court or agreed upon by those parties. The Court will not permit a party to a stipulation to qualify, change, or contradict a stipulation in whole or in part, except that it may do so where justice requires. A stipulation and the admissions therein shall be binding and have effect only in the pending case and not for any other purpose, and cannot be used against any of the parties thereto in any other case or proceeding.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:25 --><p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Noncompliance by a Party:</strong> (1) <em>Motion to Compel Stipulation: </em>If, after the date of issuance of trial notice in a case, a party has refused or failed to confer with an adversary with respect to entering into a stipulation in accordance with this Rule, or a party has refused or failed to make such a stipulation of any matter within the terms of this Rule, the party proposing to stipulate may, at a time not later than 45 days prior to the date set for call of the case from a trial calendar, file a motion with the Court for an order directing the delinquent party to show cause why the matters covered in the motion should not be deemed admitted for the purposes of the case. The motion shall (A) show with particularity and by separately numbered paragraphs each matter which is claimed for stipulation; (B) set forth in express language the specific stipulation which the moving party proposes with respect to each such matter and annex thereto or make available to the Court and the other parties each document or other paper as to which the moving party desires a stipulation; (C) set forth the sources, reasons, and basis for claiming, with respect to each such matter, that it should be stipulated; (D) show that opposing counsel or the other parties have had reasonable access to those sources or basis for stipulation and have been informed of the reasons for stipulation; and (E) show proof of service of a copy of the motion on opposing counsel or the other parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Procedure: </em>Upon the filing of such a motion, an order to show cause as moved shall be issued forthwith, unless the Court shall direct otherwise. The order to show cause will be served by the Clerk of the Court, with a copy thereof sent to the moving party. Within 20 days of the service of the order to show cause, the party to whom the order is directed shall file a response with the Court, with proof of service of a copy thereof on opposing counsel or the other parties, showing why the matters set forth in the motion papers should not be deemed admitted for purposes of the pending case. The response shall list each matter involved on which there is no dispute, referring specifically to the numbered paragraphs in the motion to which the admissions relate. Where a matter is disputed only in part, the response shall show the part admitted and the part disputed. Where the responding party is willing to stipulate in whole or in part with respect to any matter in the motion by varying or qualifying a matter in the proposed stipulation, the response shall set forth the variance or qualification and the admission which the responding party is willing to make. Where the response claims that there is a dispute as to any matter in part or in whole, or where the response presents a variance or qualification with respect to any matter in the motion, the response shall show the sources, reasons, and basis on which the responding party relies for that purpose. The Court, where it is found appropriate, may set the order to show cause for a hearing or conference at such time as the Court shall determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Failure of Response: </em>If no response is filed within the period specified with respect to any matter or portion thereof, or if the response is evasive or not fairly directed to the proposed stipulation or portion thereof, that matter or portion thereof will be deemed stipulated for purposes of the pending case, and an order will be entered accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Matters Considered: </em>Opposing claims of evidence will not be weighed under this Rule unless such evidence is patently incredible. Nor will a genuinely controverted or doubtful issue of fact be determined in advance of trial. The Court will determine whether a genuine dispute exists, or whether in the interests of justice a matter ought not be deemed stipulated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Failure to Attend Deposition or to Answer Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection or Production: </strong>If a party, or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party, or a person designated in accordance with Rule 74(b), 75(c), or 81(c) to testify on behalf of a party fails (1) to appear before the officer who is to take such person's deposition pursuant to Rule 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, or 84, or (2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted under Rule 71, after proper service thereof, or (3) to serve a written response to a request for production or inspection submitted under Rule 72 or 73 after proper service of the request, then the Court on motion may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others it may take any action authorized under paragraph (b) or (c) of this Rule. If any person, after being served with a subpoena or having waived such service, willfully fails to appear before the officer who is to take such person's deposition or refuses to be sworn, or if any person willfully fails to obey an order requiring such person to answer designated interrogatories or questions, then such failure may be considered contempt of court. The failure to act described in this paragraph (a) may not be excused on the ground that the deposition sought, or the interrogatory submitted, or the production or inspection sought, is objectionable, unless the party failing to act has theretofore raised the objection, or has applied for a protective order under Rule 103, with respect thereto at the proper time and in the proper manner, and the Court has either sustained or granted or not yet ruled on the objection or the application for the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Failure to Answer: </strong>If a person fails to answer a question or interrogatory propounded or submitted in accordance with Rule 71, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, or 84, or fails to respond to a request to produce or inspect or fails to produce or permit the inspection in accordance with Rule 72 or 73, or fails to make a designation in accordance with Rule 74(b), 75(e), or 81(c), the aggrieved party may, within the time for completion of discovery under Rule 70(a)(2), move the Court for an order compelling an answer, response, or compliance with the request, as the case may be. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the examination may be completed on other matters or the examination adjourned, as the proponent of the question may prefer, before applying for such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Sanctions: </strong>If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated in accordance with Rule 74(b), 75(c), or 81(c) fails to obey an order made by the Court with respect to the provisions of Rule 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 81, 82, 83, 84, or 90, then the Court may make such orders as to the failure as are just, and among others the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An order that the matter regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the case in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting such party <!-- PDFPage:27 -->from introducing designated matters in evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the case or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In lieu of the foregoing orders or in addition thereto, the Court may treat as a contempt of the Court the failure to obey any such order, and the Court may also require the party failing to obey the order or counsel advising such party, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including counsel's fees, caused by the failure, unless the Court finds that the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Cases Calendared: </strong>Either party in a case listed on any trial calendar may request of the Court, or the Court on its own motion may order, a pretrial conference.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Cases Not Calendared: </strong>If a case is not listed on a trial calendar, the Chief Judge, in the exercise of discretion, upon motion of either party or sua sponte, may list such case for a pretrial conference upon a calendar in the place designated for trial, or may assign the case for a pretrial conference either in Washington, D.C., or in any other convenient place.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Conditions: </strong>A request or motion for a pretrial conference shall include a statement of the reasons therefor. Pretrial conferences will in no circumstances be held as a substitute for the conferences required between the parties in order to comply with the provisions of Rule 91, but a pretrial conference, for the purpose of assisting the parties in entering into the stipulations called for by Rule 91, will be held by the Court where the party requesting such pretrial conference has in good faith attempted without success to obtain such stipulation from such party's adversary. Nor will any pretrial conference be held where the Court is satisfied that the request therefor is frivolous or is made for purposes of delay.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General: </strong>Either party may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for a summary adjudication in the moving party's favor upon all or any part of the legal issues in controversy. Such motion may be made at any time commencing 30 days after the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Motion and Proceedings Thereon: </strong>The motion shall be filed and served in accordance with the requirements otherwise applicable. See Rules 50 and 54. An opposing written response, with or without supporting affidavits, shall be filed within such period as the Court may direct. A decision shall thereafter be rendered if the pleadings, answers to interrogatories, depositions, admissions, and any other acceptable materials, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a decision may be rendered as a matter of law. A partial summary adjudication may be made which does not dispose of all the issues in the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on Motion: </strong>If, on motion under this Rule, decision is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the Court may ascertain, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel, what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. It may thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear to be without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the relief sought is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the case as are just. Upon the trial of the case, the facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be concluded accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony; Defense Required: </strong>Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or filed therewith. <!-- PDFPage:28 -->The Court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by answers to interrogatories, depositions, further affidavits, or other acceptable materials, to the extent that other applicable conditions in these Rules are satisfied for utilizing such procedures. When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this Rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of such party's pleading, but such party's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this Rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, then a decision, if appropriate, may be entered against such party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) When Affidavits Are Unavailable: </strong>If it appears from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that such party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify such party's opposition, then the Court may deny the motion or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or other steps to be taken or may make such other order as is just. If it appears from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that such party's only legally available method of contravening the facts set forth in the supporting affidavits of the moving party is through cross-examination of such affiants or the testimony of third parties from whom affidavits cannot be secured, then such a showing may be deemed sufficient to establish that the facts set forth in such supporting affidavits are genuinely disputed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Affidavits Made in Bad Faith: </strong>If it appears to the satisfaction of the Court at any time that any of the affidavits presented pursuant to this Rule are presented in bad faith or for the purpose of delay, then the Court may order the party employing them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable counsel's fees, and any offending party or counsel may be adjudged guilty of contempt or otherwise disciplined by the Court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Default: </strong>If any party has failed to plead or otherwise proceed as provided by these Rules or as required by the Court, then such party may be held in default by the Court either on motion of another party or on the initiative of the Court. Thereafter, the Court may enter a decision against the defaulting party, upon such terms and conditions as the Court may deem proper, or may impose such sanctions (see, e.g., Rule 104) as the Court may deem appropriate. The Court may, in its discretion, conduct hearings to ascertain whether a default has been committed, to determine the decision to be entered or the sanctions to be imposed, or to ascertain the truth of any matter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Dismissal: </strong>For failure of a petitioner properly to prosecute or to comply with these Rules or any order of the Court or for other cause which the Court deems sufficient, the Court may dismiss a case at any time and enter a decision against the petitioner. The Court may, for similar reasons, decide against any party any issue as to which such party has the burden of proof, and such decision shall be treated as a dismissal for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Setting Aside Default or Dismissal: </strong>For reasons deemed sufficient by the Court and upon motion expeditiously made, the Court may set aside a default or dismissal or the decision rendered thereon.</p>

Similar action may be taken where cases involve different tax liabilities of the same parties, notwithstanding the absence of a common issue. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court for good cause shown, a motion to consoli<!-- PDFPage:30 -->date cases may be filed only after all the cases sought to be consolidated have become at issue.

As to affirmative defenses, see Rule 39.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Fraud: </strong>In any case involving the issue of fraud with intent to evade tax, the burden of proof in respect of that issue is on the respondent, and that burden of proof is to be carried by clear and convincing evidence. Code Section 7454(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Foundation Managers; Trustees; Organization Managers: </strong>In any case involving the issue of the knowing conduct of a foundation manager as set forth in the provisions of Code Section 4941, 4944, or 4945, or the knowing conduct of a trustee as set forth in the provisions of Code Section 4951 or 4952, or the knowing conduct of an organization manager as set forth in the provisions of Code Section 4912 or 4955, the burden of proof in respect of such issue is on the respondent, and such burden of proof is to be carried by clear and convincing evidence. Code Section 7454(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Transferee Liability: </strong>The burden of proof is on the respondent to show that a petitioner is liable as a transferee of property of a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax. Code Section 6902(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Accumulated Earnings Tax: </strong>Where the notice of deficiency is based in whole or in part on an allegation of accumulation of corporate earnings and profits beyond the reasonable needs of the business, the burden of proof with respect to such allegation is determined in accordance with Code Section 534. If the petitioner has submitted to the respondent a statement which is claimed to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 534(c), the Court will ordinarily, on timely motion filed after the case has been calendared for trial, rule prior to the trial on whether such statement is sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the respondent to the limited extent set forth in Code Section 534(a)(2).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 143. Evidence</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General: </strong>Trials before the Court will be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence applicable in trials without a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See Code Section 7453. To the extent applicable to such trials, those rules include the rules of evidence in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and any rules of evidence generally applicable in the Federal courts (including the United States District Court for the District of Columbia). Evidence which is relevant only to the issue of a party's entitlement to reasonable litigation or administrative costs shall not be introduced during the trial of the case (other than a case commenced under Title XXVI of these Rules, relating to actions for administrative costs). As to claims for reasonable litigation or administrative costs and their disposition, see Rules 231 and 232. As to evidence in an action for administrative costs, see Rule 274 (and that Rule's incorporation of the provisions of Rule 177(b)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Ex Parte Statements: </strong>Ex parte affidavits, statements in briefs, and unadmitted allegations in pleadings do not constitute evidence. As to allegations in pleadings not denied, see Rules 36(c) and 37(c) and (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Depositions: </strong>Testimony taken by deposition shall not be treated as evidence in a case until offered and received in evidence. Error in the transcript of a deposition may be corrected by agreement of the parties, or by the Court on proof it deems satisfactory to show an error exists and the correction to be made, subject to the requirements of Rules 81(h)(1) and 85(e). As to the use of a deposition, see Rule 81(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Documentary Evidence:</strong> (1) <em>Copies: </em>A clearly legible copy of any book, record, paper, or document may be offered directly in evidence in lieu of the original, where there is no objection, or where the original is available but admission of a copy is authorized by the Court; however, unless impractical, the Court may require the submission of the original. Where the original is admitted in evidence, a clearly legible copy may be substituted later for the original or such part thereof as may be material or relevant, upon leave granted in the discretion of the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Return of Exhibits: </em>Exhibits may be disposed of as the Court deems advisable. A party desiring the return at such party's expense of any exhibit belonging to such party, shall, within 90 days after the decision of the case by the Court has become final, make written application to the Clerk, suggesting a practical manner of delivery. If such application is not timely made, the exhibits in the case will be destroyed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Interpreters: </strong>The parties ordinarily will be expected to make their own arrangements for obtaining and compensating interpreters. However, the Court may appoint an interpreter of its own selection and may fix the interpreter's reasonable compensation, which compensation shall be paid by one or more of the parties or otherwise as the Court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(f) Expert Witness Reports:</strong> (1) Unless otherwise permitted by the Court upon timely request, any party who calls an expert witness shall cause that witness to prepare a written re<!-- PDFPage:31 -->port for submission to the Court and to the opposing party. The report shall set forth the qualifications of the expert witness and shall state the witness&rsquo; opinion and the facts or data on which that opinion is based. The report shall set forth in detail the reasons for the conclusion, and it will be marked as an exhibit, identified by the witness, and received in evidence as the direct testimony of the expert witness, unless the Court determines that the witness is not qualified as an expert. Additional direct testimony with respect to the report may be allowed to clarify or emphasize matters in the report, to cover matters arising after the preparation of the report, or otherwise at the discretion of the Court. If not furnished earlier, each party who calls any expert witness shall furnish to each other party, and shall submit to the Court, not later than 30 days before the call of the trial calendar on which the case shall appear, a copy of all expert witness reports prepared pursuant to this subparagraph. An expert witness&rsquo; testimony will be excluded altogether for failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph, unless the failure is shown to be due to good cause and unless the failure does not unduly prejudice the opposing party, such as by significantly impairing the opposing party's ability to cross-examine the expert witness or by denying the opposing party the reasonable opportunity to obtain evidence in rebuttal to the expert witness&rsquo; testimony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Court ordinarily will not grant a request to permit an expert witness to testify without a written report where the expert witness&rsquo; testimony is based on third-party contacts, comparable sales, statistical data, or other detailed, technical information. The Court may grant such a request, for example, where the expert witness testifies only with respect to industry practice or only in rebuttal to another expert witness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For circumstances under which the transcript of the deposition of an expert witness may serve as the written report required by subparagraph (1), see Rule 76(e)(1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Production of Documentary Evidence:</strong> A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce the books, papers, documents, or tangible things designated therein; but the Court, upon motion made promptly and in any event at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance therewith, may (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive, or (2) condition denial of the motion upon the advancement by the person in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost of producing the books, papers, documents, or tangible things.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Service:</strong> A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal, or by a deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to such person and by tendering to such person the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Commissioner, fees and mileage need not be tendered. See Rule 148 for fees and mileage payable. The person making service of a subpoena shall make the return thereon in accordance with the form appearing in the subpoena.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Subpoena for Taking Depositions:</strong> (1) <em>Issuance and Response:</em> The order of the Court ap<!-- PDFPage:32 -->proving the taking of a deposition pursuant to Rule 81(b)(2), or the executed stipulation pursuant to Rule 81(d), or the service of the notice of deposition pursuant to Rule 74(b) or 75(c), constitutes authorization for issuance of subpoenas for the persons named or described therein. The subpoena may command the person to whom it is directed to produce and permit inspection and copying of designated books, papers, documents, or tangible things, which come within the scope of the order or stipulation pursuant to which the deposition is taken. Within 15 days after service of the subpoena or such earlier time designated therein for compliance, the person to whom the subpoena is directed may serve upon the party on whose behalf the subpoena has been issued written objections to compliance with the subpoena in any or all respects. Such objections should not include objections made, or which might have been made, to the application to take the deposition pursuant to Rule 81(b)(2) or to the notice of deposition under Rule 74(c) or 75(d). If an objection is made, the party serving the subpoena shall not be entitled to compliance therewith to the extent of such objection, except as the Court may order otherwise upon application to it. Such application for an order may be made, with notice to the other party and to any other objecting persons, at any time before or during the taking of the deposition, subject to the time requirements of Rule 70(a)(2) or Rule 81(b)(2). As to availability of protective orders, see Rule 103; and, as to enforcement of such subpoenas, see Rule 104.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Place of Examination:</em> The place designated in the subpoena for examination of the deponent shall be the place specified in the notice of deposition served pursuant to Rule 74(b) or 75(c) or in the order of the Court referred to in Rule 81(b)(2) or in the executed stipulation referred to in Rule 81(d). With respect to a deposition to be taken in a foreign country, see Rules 74(e), 81(e)(2), and 84(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Contempt:</strong> Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a subpoena served upon any such person may be deemed a contempt of the Court.</p>

Facts may be established by stipulation in accordance with Rule 91, but the mere filing of such stipulation does not relieve the party, upon whom rests the burden of proof, of the necessity of properly producing evidence in support of facts not adequately established by such stipulation.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Agreed Computations:</strong> Where the Court has filed or stated its opinion determining the issues in a case, it may withhold entry of its decision for the purpose of permitting the parties to submit computations pursuant to the Court's determination of the issues, showing the correct amount of the deficiency, liability, or overpayment to be entered as the decision. If the parties are in agreement as to the amount of the deficiency or overpayment to be entered as the decision pursuant to the findings and conclusions of the Court, then they, or either of them, shall file promptly with the Court an original and two copies of a computation showing the amount of the deficiency, liability, or overpayment and that there is no disagreement that the figures shown are in accordance with the findings and conclusions of the Court. In the case of an overpayment, the computation shall also include the amount and date of each payment made by the petitioner. The Court will then enter its decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure in Absence of Agreement:</strong> If, however, the parties are not in agreement as to the amount of the deficiency, liability, or overpayment to be entered as the decision in accordance with the findings and conclusions of the Court, then either of them may file with the Court a computation of the deficiency, liability, or overpayment believed by such party to be in accordance with the Court's findings and conclusions. In the case of an overpayment, the computation shall also include the amount and date of each payment made by the petitioner. The Clerk will serve upon the opposite party a notice of such filing accompanied by a copy of such computation. If the opposite party fails to file objection, accompanied or preceded by an alternative computation, then, on or before a date specified in the Clerk's notice, the Court may enter decision in accordance with the computation already submitted. If in accordance with this Rule computations are submitted by the parties which differ as to the amount to be entered as the decision of the Court, then the parties may, at the Court's discretion, be afforded an opportunity to be heard in argument thereon and the Court will determine the correct deficiency, liability, or overpayment and will enter its decision accordingly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Limit on Argument:</strong> Any argument under this Rule will be confined strictly to consideration of the correct computation of the deficiency, liability, or overpayment resulting from the findings and conclusions made by the Court, and no argument will be heard upon or consideration given to the issues or matters disposed of by the Court's findings and conclusions or to <!-- PDFPage:34 -->any new issues.

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 202. Disqualification, Suspension, or Disbarment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> The Court may deny admission to its Bar to, or suspend, or disbar, any person who in its judgment does not possess the requisite qualifications to represent others, or who is lacking in character, integrity, or proper professional conduct. Upon the conviction of any practitioner admitted to practice before this Court for a criminal violation of any provision of the Internal Revenue Code or for any crime involving moral turpitude, or where any practitioner has been suspended or disbarred from the practice of his or her profession in any State or the District of Columbia, or any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, the Court may, in the exercise of its discretion, forthwith suspend such practitioner from the Bar of this Court until further order of Court; but otherwise no person shall be suspended for more than 60 days or disbarred until such person has been afforded an opportunity to be heard. A Judge of the Court may immediately suspend any person for not more than 60 days for contempt or misconduct during the course of any trial or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Disciplinary Proceedings:</strong> (1) <em>Referral to Counsel:</em> When misconduct or allegations of misconduct which, if substantiated, would warrant discipline of a practitioner shall come to the attention of the Court, whether by complaint or otherwise, and the applicable procedure is not otherwise mandated by these Rules (see paragraph (a) of this Rule), the Court, in its discretion, may refer the matter to counsel to the Court (appointed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this Rule) for investigation and the prosecution of a formal disciplinary proceeding or the formation of such other recommendation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Investigation and Recommendation:</em> If counsel concludes after investigation and review that a formal disciplinary proceeding should not be initiated against the practitioner because sufficient evidence is not present, or because there is pending another proceeding against the practitioner, the disposition of which in the judgment of the counsel should be awaited before further action by this Court is considered, or for any other valid reason, then counsel shall file with the Court a recommendation for disposition of the matter, whether by dismissal, admonition, deferral, or otherwise, setting forth the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Initiation of Proceedings:</em> To initiate formal disciplinary proceedings, the Court shall enter an order (or, where counsel is appointed, such counsel shall obtain an order of the Court upon a showing of probable cause) requiring the practitioner to show cause within 30 days after service of that order upon that practitioner, why the practitioner should not be disciplined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <em>Hearing:</em> Upon the practitioner's answer to the order to show cause, if any issue of fact is raised or the practitioner wishes to be heard in mitigation, then this Court shall set the matter for prompt hearing before one or more Judges of this Court. However, if the disciplinary proceeding is predicated upon the complaint of a Judge of this Court, then the hearing shall be conducted before a panel of three other Judges of this Court appointed by the Chief Judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <em>Right to Counsel:</em> In all proceedings conducted under the provisions of this Rule, the practitioner shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Reinstatement:</strong> (1) <em>After Disbarment or Suspension:</em> A practitioner suspended for 60 days or less shall be automatically reinstated at the end of the period of suspension. A practitioner suspended for more than 60 days or disbarred may not resume practice until reinstated by order of this Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Hearing on Application:</em> A petition for reinstatement by a disbarred or suspended practitioner under this Rule shall be filed with the Court. Upon receipt of the petition, the Court may promptly refer the petition to counsel and shall assign the matter for prompt hearing before one or more Judges of this Court. However, if the disciplinary proceeding was predicated upon the complaint of a Judge of this Court, then the hearing shall be conducted before a panel of three other Judges of this Court appointed by the Chief Judge. The Judge or Judges assigned to the matter shall, as promptly as the Court's business shall permit, schedule a hearing at which the practitioner shall have the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the practitioner has the moral qualifications, competency and learning in the law required for admission to practice before this Court and that the practitioner's resumption of such practice will not be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the Bar or to the administration of justice, or subversive of the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Successive Petitions:</em> No petition for reinstatement under this Rule shall be filed within <!-- PDFPage:39 -->1 year following an adverse decision upon a petition for reinstatement filed by or on behalf of the same person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Presentation to the Court:</strong> When counsel is to be appointed pursuant to this Rule to investigate allegations of misconduct or prosecute disciplinary proceedings or in conjunction with a reinstatement petition filed by a practitioner, this Court shall appoint as counsel to the Court a member of the Bar of this Court who is a resident of or who practices in the same Federal judicial circuit (see 28 U.S.C. Section 41), except the Federal Circuit, as the Federal judicial circuit which includes the practitioner's place of residence or practice. The practitioner may move to disqualify a person so appointed for cause, for example, if such person is or has been engaged as an adversary of the practitioner in any matter. Counsel, once appointed, may not resign unless permission to do so is given by the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(e) Jurisdiction:</strong> Nothing contained in this Rule shall be construed to deny to this Court such powers as are necessary for the Court to maintain control over proceedings conducted before it, such as proceedings for contempt under Code Section 7456.</p>

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Answer:</strong> (1) <em>Time to Answer or Move:</em> The Commissioner shall have 60 days from the date of service of the petition within which to file an answer, or 45 days from that date within which to move with respect to the petition. With respect to an amended petition or amendments to the petition, the Commissioner shall have like time periods from the date of service of those papers within which to answer or move in response thereto, except as the Court may otherwise direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Form and Content:</em> The answer shall be drawn so that it will advise the petitioner and the Court fully of the nature of the defense. It shall contain a specific admission or denial of each material allegation of the petition. If the Commissioner shall be without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation as to jurisdictional facts or as to inferences or conclusions that may be drawn from materials in the administrative record or as to facts involved in a revocation, then the Commissioner may so state, and such statement shall have the effect of a denial. Facts other than jurisdictional facts, and other than facts involved in a revocation or in a governmental obligation action, may be admitted only for purposes of the pending action for declaratory judgment. If the Commissioner intends to clarify or to deny only a part of an allegation, then the Commissioner shall specify so much of it as is true and shall qualify or deny only the remainder. In addition, the answer shall contain a clear and concise statement of every ground, together with the facts in support thereof, on which the Commissioner relies and has the burden of proof.

<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Reply:</strong> Each petitioner shall file a reply in every action for declaratory judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Time to Reply or Move:</em> The petitioner shall have 60 days from the date of service of the answer within which to file a reply, or 30 days from that date within which to move with respect to the answer. With respect to an amended answer or amendments to the answer, the petitioner shall have like periods from the date of service of those papers within which to reply or move in response thereto, except as the Court may otherwise direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Form and Content:</em> In response to each material allegation in the answer and the facts in support thereof on which the Commissioner has the burden of proof, the reply shall contain a specific admission or denial; however, if the petitioner shall be without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an allegation, then the petitioner shall so state, and such statement shall have the effect of a denial. If the petitioner denies the affirmative allegation in the answer that a complete index of the contents of the administrative record is attached to the answer, then the petitioner shall specify the reasons for such denial. In addition, the reply shall contain a clear and concise statement of every ground, together with the facts in support thereof, on which the petitioner relies affirmatively or in avoidance of any matter in the answer on which the Commissioner has the burden of proof. In other respects, the requirements of pleading applicable to the answer provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this Rule shall <!-- PDFPage:43 -->apply to the reply.

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 215. Joinder of Parties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) Joinder in Retirement Plan Action:</strong> The joinder of parties in retirement plan actions shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Permissive Joinder:</em> Any person who, under Code Section 7476(b)(1), is entitled to commence an action for declaratory judgment with respect to the qualification of a retirement plan may join in filing a petition with any other such person in such an action with respect to the same plan. If the Commissioner has issued a notice of determination with respect to the qualification of the plan, then any person joining in the petition must do so within the period specified in Code Section 7476(b)(5). If more than one petition is filed with respect to the qualification of the same retirement plan, then see Rule 141 (relating to the possibility of consolidating the actions with respect to the plan).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Joinder of Additional Parties:</em> Any party to an action for declaratory judgment with respect to the qualification of a retirement plan may move to have joined in the action any employer who established or maintains the plan, plan administrator, or any person in whose absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court, any such motion must be filed not later than 30 days after joinder of issue (see Rule 214). Such motion shall be served on the parties to the action (other than the movant). See Rule 21(b). The movant shall cause personal service to be made on each person sought to be joined by a United States marshal or by a deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age, who shall make a return of service, see Form 13, Appendix I. Such return of service shall be filed with the motion, but failure to do so or otherwise to make proof of service does not affect the validity of the service. Unless otherwise permitted by the Court, any objection to such motion shall be filed within 30 days after the service of the motion. The motion will be granted whenever the Court finds that in the interests of justice such person should be joined. If the motion is granted, such person will thereupon become a party to the action, and the Court will enter such orders as it deems appropriate as to further pleading and other matters. See Rule 50(b) with respect to actions on motions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <em>Nonjoinder of Necessary Parties:</em> If the Court determines that any person described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a necessary party to an action for declaratory judgment and that such person has not been joined, then the Court may, on its own motion or on the motion of any party or any such person, dismiss the action on the ground that the absent person is necessary and that justice cannot be accomplished in the absent person's absence, or direct that any such person be made a party to the action. An order dismissing a case for nonjoinder of a necessary party may be conditional or absolute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Joinder of Parties in Exempt Organization and in Governmental Obligation Actions:</strong> Joinder of parties is not permitted in an exempt organization action or in a governmental obligation action. See Code Sections 7428(b)(1) and 7478(b)(1). With respect to consolidation of actions, see Rule 141.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">Rule 217. Disposition of Actions for Declaratory Judgment</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> Disposition of an action for declaratory judgment, which does not involve either a revocation or the status of a governmental obligation, will ordinarily be made on the basis of the administrative record, as defined in Rule 210(b)(10). Only with the permission of the Court, upon good cause shown, will any party be permitted to introduce before the Court any evidence other than that presented before the Internal Revenue Service and contained in the administrative record as so defined. Disposition of an action for declaratory judgment involving a revocation may be made on the basis of the administrative record alone only where the parties agree that such record contains all the relevant facts and that such facts are not in dispute. Disposition of a governmental obligation action will be made on the basis of the administrative record, augmented by additional evidence to the extent that the Court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Procedure:</strong> (1) <em>Disposition on the Administrative Record:</em> The Court expects that, within 30 <!-- PDFPage:44 -->days after service of the answer, the parties will file with the Court the entire administrative record (or so much thereof as either party may deem necessary for a complete disposition of the action for declaratory judgment), stipulated as to its genuineness. If, however, the parties are unable to file such a stipulated administrative record, then, not sooner than 30 days nor later than 45 days after service of the answer, the Commissioner shall file with the Court the entire administrative record, as defined in Rule 210(b)(10), appropriately certified as to its genuineness by the Commissioner or by an official authorized to act for the Commissioner in such situation. See Rule 212, as to the time and place for submission of the action to the Court. The Court will thereafter issue an opinion and declaratory judgment in the action. Except in a case involving a revocation or the status of a governmental obligation, the Court's decision will be based upon the assumption that the facts as represented in the administrative record as so stipulated or so certified are true and upon any additional facts as found by the Court if the Court deems that a trial is necessary. In the case of a revocation or a governmental obligation action, the Court may, upon the basis of the evidence presented, make findings of fact which differ from the administrative record. In the case of a governmental obligation action, see the last sentence of paragraph (a) of this Rule. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <em>Other Dispositions Without Trial:</em> In addition, an action for declaratory judgment may be decided on a motion for a judgment on the pleadings under Rule 120 or on a motion for summary judgment under Rule 121 or such an action may be submitted at any time by notice of the parties filed with the Court in accordance with Rule 122.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <em>Disposition Where Trial is Required:</em> Whenever a trial is required in an action for declaratory judgment, such trial shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules contained in Title XIV, except as otherwise provided in this Title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Burden of Proof:</strong> The burden of proof in declaratory judgment actions shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <em>Retirement Plan Actions:</em> (A) <em>Parties Petitioner:</em> In all cases, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner as to jurisdictional requirements. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, and upon any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, as to those grounds set forth in the respondent's notice of determination that a retirement plan does not qualify. If the respondent has determined that a retirement plan does qualify, then the petitioner, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground on which each such party relies to sustain such party's position that such plan does not qualify. If the Commissioner has failed to issue a notice of determination, then&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the petitioner who contends that the retirement plan does qualify, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to the jurisdictional requirements described in Rule 210(c) and also with respect to the date on which the request for determination, if any, was mailed to the Internal Revenue Service and the office to which it was mailed, and that the notice of determination has been issued by the Commissioner; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the petitioner who contends that the retirement plan does not qualify, and any party joining or intervening on the petitioner's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to the matters set forth in subparagraph (1)(A)(i) of this paragraph (c) and also as to the grounds and supporting facts on which each such party relies for such party's claim that the plan does not qualify.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Parties Respondent:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the respondent, and upon any party joining or intervening on the respondent's side, as to any ground not stated in the notice of determination upon which either relies to sustain the respondent's determination that a retirement plan does not qualify. If the respondent has not issued a notice of determination, then the respondent, and any party joining or intervening on the respondent's side, shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground upon which either relies to sustain the position that such plan does not qualify. See also subparagraph (1)(A)(ii) of this paragraph (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <em>Other Actions:</em> (A) <em>Petitioner:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner as to jurisdictional requirements and as to the grounds set forth in the notice of determination. If the Commissioner has failed to issue a notice of determination, then the burden of proof shall be on the petitioner with respect to jurisdictional requirements, and also with respect to the date on which the request for determination, if any, was mailed to the Internal Revenue Service and the office to which it was mailed, and that no notice of determination has been issued by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <em>Respondent:</em> The burden of proof shall be upon the respondent as to any ground upon which the respondent relies and which is not stated in the notice of determination. If the respondent has not issued a notice of determination, then the respondent shall bear the burden of proof as to every ground relied upon to sustain the respondent's position, other than those matters as to which the burden is on the petitioner under subparagraph (2)(A) of this paragraph (c) where such a notice is not issued.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(a) General:</strong> A motion for reasonable litigation or administrative costs may be disposed of in one or more of the following ways, in the discretion of the Court:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Court may take such action as it deems appropriate, on such prior notice, if any, which it may consider reasonable. The action of the Court may be taken without written response or hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Court may take action after directing that a written response be filed. In that event, the motion shall be served upon the Commissioner, who shall file such response within 60 days after service of the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) After receiving the Commissioner's response, the Court may direct a hearing, which will be held at a location that serves the convenience of the parties and the Court. A motion for reasonable litigation or administrative costs ordinarily will be disposed of without a hearing unless it is clear from the motion and the Commissioner's written response that there is a bona fide factual dispute that cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(b) Conference Required: </strong>If the Court directs the Commissioner to file a written response, then counsel for the Commissioner and the moving party or counsel for the moving party shall confer prior to the date for filing such response and attempt to reach an agreement as to each of the allegations by the moving party. The Court expects that, at such conference, the moving party or counsel for the moving party shall make available to counsel for the Commissioner substantially the same information relating to any claim for attorney's fees which, in the absence of an agreement, the moving party would be required to file with the Court pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Rule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(c) Response by the Commissioner: </strong>If the Court directs the Commissioner to file a written response, then such response shall specifically state:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Whether the Commissioner agrees that the moving party has substantially prevailed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Whether the Commissioner agrees that the position of the Commissioner was not substantially justified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Whether the Commissioner agrees that the moving party meets the net worth requirements, if applicable, as provided by law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whether the Commissioner agrees that the moving party has exhausted the administrative remedies available to such party within the Internal Revenue Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Whether the Commissioner agrees that the moving party has not unreasonably protracted the Court proceeding and (if the claim includes a claim for administrative costs) the administrative proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Whether the Commissioner agrees that the amounts of costs claimed are reasonable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The basis for the Commissioner's disagreeing with any such allegations by the moving party.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the Commissioner agrees with the moving party's request for a hearing, or if the Commissioner requests a hearing, then such response shall include a statement of the Commissioner's reasons why the motion cannot be disposed of without a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body"><strong>(d) Additional Affidavit:</strong> Where the Commissioner's response indicates that the Commissioner and the moving party are unable to agree as to the amount of attorney's fees which is reasonable, counsel for the moving party shall, within 30 days after service of the Commissioner's response, file an additional affidavit which shall include:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A detailed summary of the time expended by each individual for whom fees are sought, including a description of the nature of the services performed during each period of time summarized. Each such individual is expected to maintain contemporaneous, complete, and standardized time records which accurately reflect the work done by such individual.
