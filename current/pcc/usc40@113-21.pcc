If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid in any of its applications, the provision remains valid for all valid applications that are severable from any of the invalid applications.''

I21This section is added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words ``this Act'', meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. In the positive law codification of title 40, most of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is restated as subtitle I of title 40. However, title III of the Act, which is outside the scope of the positive law codification, remains classified to the United States Code as 41 U.S.C. 251 et seq. Where the words ``this Act'' are restated, substituting the words ``this subtitle'' does not yield an accurate literal translation because ``this subtitle'' does not include title III of the Act. This section does not subject any provision of law to title III of the Act if that provision was not subject to title III prior to the positive law codification of title 40.

I21In subsection (e)(1)(C), the words ``transfer the function from one component of the Administration to another'' are substituted for ``from time to time, to regroup, transfer, and distribute any such functions within the General Services Administration'' (in 40:754 (1st sentence)) for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

I21In subsection (e)(2), subparagraph (A) is substituted for 40:754 (last sentence) and subparagraph (B) is substituted for 40:486(f) to use more consistent terminology and to clarify the requirements and applicability of each provision.

I21Ex. Ord. No. 12512, Apr. 29, 1985, 50 F.R. 18453, which related to Federal real property management, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13327, ÿ1A8, Feb. 4, 2004, 69 F.R. 5897, set out below.

I86Ex. Ord. No. T112954K. Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts

I21Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:

I21Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.

I21An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.

I21NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)] and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.

I21T4SecK. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (``Secretary'') may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.

I21(b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been permanently replaced.

I21(c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.

I21T4SecK. 3. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may make a finding that it is appropriate to terminate the contract for convenience. The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head of any department or agency that contracts with the contractor.

I21(b) The head of the contracting department or agency may object to the termination for convenience of a contract or contracts of a contractor determined to have permanently replaced legally striking employees. If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract or contracts in a response in writing to the Secretary. In such case, the termination for convenience shall not be issued. The head of the contracting agency or department shall report to the Secretary those contracts that have been terminated for convenience under this section.

I21T4SecK. 4. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may debar the contractor, thereby making the contractor ineligible to receive government contracts. The Secretary shall notify the Administrator of the General Services Administration of the debarment, and the Administrator shall include the contractor on the consolidated list of debarred contractors. Departments and agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of the agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that there is a compelling reason for such action, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

I21(b) The scope of the debarment normally will be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary finds to have permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.

I21(c) The period of the debarment may not extend beyond the date when the labor dispute precipitating the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers has been resolved, as determined by the Secretary.

I21T4SecK. 5. The Secretary shall publish or cause to be published, in the Federal Register, the names of contractors that have, in the judgement of the Secretary, permanently replaced lawfully striking employees and have been the subject of debarment.

I21T4SecK. 6. The Secretary shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, may adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.

I21T4SecK. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary's functions under this order.

I21T4SecK. 8. The Secretary may delegate any function or duty of the Secretary under this order to any officer in the Department of Labor or to any other officer in the executive branch of the Government, with the consent of the head of the department or agency in which that officer serves.

I21T4SecK. 9. The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall take whatever action is appropriate to implement the provisions of this order and of any related rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to this order.

I21T4SecK. 10. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 T3et seq.

I21T4SecK. 11. The meaning of the term ``organizational unit of a Federal contractor'' as used in this order shall be defined in regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with affected agencies. This order shall apply only to contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

I21T4SecK. 12. (a) The provisions of section 3 of this order shall only apply to situations in which contractors have permanently replaced lawfully striking employees after the effective date of this order.

I21(b) This order is effective immediately.

I86Disposing of Unneeded Federal Real Estate_Increasing Sales Proceeds, Cutting Operating Costs, and Improving Energy Efficiency

I21Memorandum of President of the United States, June 10, 2010, 75 F.R. 33987, provided:

I21Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

I21My Administration is committed to eliminating all forms of Government waste and to leading by example as our Nation transitions to a clean energy economy. For decades, the Federal Government, the largest property owner and energy user in the United States, has managed more real estate than necessary to effectively support its programs and missions. Both taxpayer dollars and energy resources are being wasted to maintain these excess assets. In addition, many of the properties necessary for the Government's work are not operated efficiently, resulting in wasted funds and excessive greenhouse gas pollution. For example, over the past decade, the private sector reduced its data center footprint by capitalizing on innovative technologies to increase efficiencies. However, during that same period, the Federal Government experienced a substantial increase in the number of data centers, leading to increased energy consumption, real property expenditures, and operations and maintenance costs. Past attempts at reducing the Federal Government's civilian real property assets produced small savings and had a minor impact on the condition and performance of mission-critical properties. These efforts were not sufficiently comprehensive in disposing of excess real estate and did not emphasize making more efficient use of existing assets.

I21To eliminate wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars, save energy and water, and further reduce greenhouse gas pollution, I hereby direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to accelerate efforts to identify and eliminate excess properties. Agencies shall also take immediate steps to make better use of remaining real property assets as measured by utilization and occupancy rates, annual operating cost, energy efficiency, and sustainability. To the extent permitted by law, agency actions shall include accelerating cycle times for identifying excess assets and disposing of surplus assets; eliminating lease arrangements that are not cost effective; pursuing consolidation opportunities within and across agencies in common asset types (such as data centers, office space, warehouses, and laboratories); increasing occupancy rates in current facilities through innovative approaches to space management and alternative workplace arrangements, such as telework; and identifying offsetting reductions in inventory when new space is acquired. Agency actions taken under this memorandum shall align with and support the actions to measure and reduce resource use and greenhouse gas emissions in Federal facilities pursuant to Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009 (Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance), and the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, which was announced by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in February 2010.

I21In total, agency efforts required by this memorandum should produce no less than $3 billion in cost savings by the end of fiscal year 2012, yielded from increased proceeds from the sale of assets and reduced operating, maintenance, and energy expenses from disposals or other space consolidation efforts, including leases that are ended. This is in addition to the Department of Defense's Base Realignment and Closure efforts that are expected to achieve $9.8 billion in savings from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2012, of which $5 billion is a direct result of reduced operating and maintenance from disposals or other consolidation efforts. In addition, in order to address the growth of data centers across the Federal Government, agencies shall immediately adopt a policy against expanding data centers beyond current levels, and shall develop plans to consolidate and significantly reduce data centers within 5 years. Agencies shall submit their plans to OMB for review by August 30, 2010.

I21To achieve these goals, the Director of the OMB shall develop, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Federal Real Property Council established pursuant to Executive Order 13327 of February 4, 2004 (Federal Real Property Asset Management), within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, guidance for actions agencies should take to carry out the requirements of this memorandum. The guidance shall include agency-specific targets to achieve $3 billion in cost savings and shall be developed in consultation with the agencies. The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Director of the OMB, shall coordinate agency efforts to satisfy the requirements of this memorandum and shall submit to the President periodic reports on the results achieved.

I21This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

I21The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

The words ``or engage in'', ``or engaged in'', ``securing or'', and ``secure or'' are omitted as unnecessary. The word ``money'' is substituted for ``payment'' for consistency in the section.

I21In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words ``because of each act'' are substituted for ``by reason thereof'' for clarity.

I21In subsection (a)(2), the words ``or any Federal agency'' and ``or any Federal agency, as the case may be'' are omitted as unnecessary.

I21In subsection (a)(3), the words ``fraudulently obtained'' are substituted for ``thus secured and obtained'' for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

The words ``the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia'' in section 209(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 are omitted as included in ``a district court of the United States'' because of sections 88 and 132(a) of title 28.

I71Message of the President

I33To the Congress of the United States:

I21I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.

I21The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services_the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.

I21Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.

I21Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.

I21The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.

I21This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.

I21Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.

I21In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.

I21While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.

I21The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.

I21After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.

I21While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.

I21In subsections (a) and (b), the words ``and title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.)'' are added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words ``this Act'', meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. See the revision note under section 111 of this title. Reference to title V of this Act is omitted as obsolete because of the Act of October 22, 1968 (Public Law 90ÿ09620, 82 Stat. 1238), the first section of which enacted Title 44, United States Code. The responsibilities of the Administrator of General Services under title V were given to the Archivist of the United States, National Historical Publications and Records Commission, and Advisory Committee on the Records of Congress.

I21In subsection (a), the words ``subject to chapters 33 and 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5'' are substituted for ``subject to the civil-service and classification laws'' because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89ÿ09554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.

The words ``personnel (including armed services personnel) from an executive agency other than the General Services Administration'' are substituted for ``officials, officers, and other personnel in other executive agencies, including personnel of the armed services'' for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

I21In subsection (d), the words ``On and after June 23, 1913'' are omitted as obsolete. The word ``Administrator'' is substituted for ``Secretary of the Treasury'' [subsequently changed to ``Federal Works Administrator'' because of section 301 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff. July 1, 1939, 53 Stat. 1426)], and the word ``Administration'' [meaning the General Services Administration] is substituted for ``public-buildings service'' and ``Office of the Supervising Architect'' [subsequently changed to ``Public Buildings Administration'' because of section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166 (eff. June 10, 1933) and section 303 of Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939 (eff.

This Executive order streamlines the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment to our Nation's classrooms and encourages Federal employees to volunteer their time and expertise to assist teachers and to connect classrooms.

I21Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3701 T3et seq.K), the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, ch. 288, 63 Stat. 377 [now chapters 1 to 11 of this title and division C (except sections 3302, 3307(e), 3501(b), 3509, 3906, 4710, and 4711) of subtitle I of Title 41, Public Contracts], and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, Public Law 104ÿ09106 [see Tables for classification], it is hereby ordered as follows:

I86Facilitating Access to Federal Property for Siting of Mobile Services Antennas

I21Memorandum of President of the United States, Aug. 10, 1995, 60 F.R. 42023, provided:

I21Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies

I21Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.

I21Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.

I21The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:

I211. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.

I21(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.

I21(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.

I21(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.

I212. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.

I213. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.

I21This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.

I21All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.

I21This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.

I21This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

I11(b) T4Transfer of Functions by Director of the Office of Management and Budget._

I12(1) T4In generalK._When the Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines that it is in the interest of economy or efficiency, the Director shall transfer to the Administrator all functions vested in a federal agency with respect to the operation, maintenance, and custody of an office building owned by the Government or a wholly owned Government corporation, or an office building, or part of an office building, that is occupied by a federal agency under a lease.

I12(2) T4Exception for post-office buildingsK._A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a post-office building, unless the Director determines that the building is not used predominantly for post-office purposes. The Administrator may delegate functions with respect to a post-office building that are transferred to the Administrator under this subsection only to another officer or employee of the General Services Administration or to the Postmaster General.

I12(3) T4Exception for buildings in a foreign countryK._A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building located in a foreign country.

I12(4) T4Exception for department of defense buildingsK._A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building located on the grounds of a facility of the Department of Defense (including a fort, camp, post, arsenal, navy yard, naval training station, airfield, proving ground, military supply depot, or school) unless and only to the extent that the Secretary of Defense has issued a permit for use by another agency.

I12(5) T4Exception for groups of special purpose buildingsK._A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for a building that the Director finds to be a part of a group of buildings that are_

I13(A) located in the same vicinity;

I13(B) used wholly or predominantly for the special purposes of the agency with custody of the buildings; and

I13(C) not generally suitable for use by another agency.

Q04

I12(6) T4Exception for certain government buildingsK._A transfer of functions shall not be made under this subsection for the Treasury Building, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Building, the buildings occupied by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the buildings under the jurisdiction of the regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97ÿ09258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:502, continued the designation as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

In order to make the Federal use of work space (including office space, warehouses and special purpose space, whether federally owned, leased or controlled) and related furnishings more effective in support of agency missions, minimize the acquisition of government resources, and reduce the administrative costs of the Federal government, the heads of all Federal Executive agencies shall:

I21(a) Establish programs to reduce the amount of work space, used or held, to that amount which is essential for known agency missions;

I21(b) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs;

I21(c) Ensure that the amount of office space used by each employee of the agency, or others using agency-controlled space, is held to the minimum necessary to accomplish the task that must be performed;

I21(d) Manage the furniture, equipment, decoration, drapes, carpeting, plants and other accoutrements so that the use of all furnishings by the agency reflects a judicious employment of public moneys;

I21(e) Consider, in making decisions concerning the use, acquisition, or disposal of work space and related furnishings, the effects of its actions on costs incurred by other Federal agencies;

I21(f) Report all vacant work space retained for future Federal uses to the Administrator of General Services so that it may be made available for the temporary use of other Federal agencies, to the extent consistent with national defense requirements;

I21(g) Establish a work space management plan to meet the provisions of this Order, including specification of the goals to be achieved and actions to be taken by the agency in order to improve its utilization of all work space and related furnishings; and

I21(h) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls and conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator of General Services, so that a government-wide reporting system may be developed.

I21T4SecK. 2. The Administrator of General Services is delegated authority, to the extent not prohibited by other laws, to conduct surveys, establish agency-wide objectives for work space use for each Executive agency, and establish procedures, guidelines and regulations to be followed by the agencies in developing the work space planning, information and reporting systems required by this Order.

I12(2) T4TermsK._A lease agreement under this subsection shall be on terms the Administrator considers to be in the interest of the Federal Government and necessary for the accommodation of the federal agency. However, the lease agreement may not bind the Government for more than 20 years and the obligation of amounts for a lease under this subsection is limited to the current fiscal year for which payments are due without regard to section 1341(a)(1)(B) of title 31.

I12(2) T4RatesK._The Administrator shall, from time to time, determine the rates to be charged for furnishing space and services and shall prescribe regulations providing for the rates. The rates shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. However, for a building for which the Administrator is responsible for alterations only (as the term ``alter'' is defined in section 3301(a) of this title), the rates shall be fixed to recover only the approximate cost incurred in providing alterations.

I12(3) T4ExemptionsK._The Administrator may exempt anyone from the charges required by this subsection when the Administrator determines that charges would be infeasible or impractical.

I21In subsection (b)(3), the words ``Federal Buildings Fund'' are substituted for ``the fund'' for clarity and to execute the probable intent of Congress. Sections 3 and 4 of the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92ÿ09313, 86 Stat. 218) added subsection (j) of 40:490 (in which the words ``the fund'' appear) and amended subsection (f) to create a fund into which ``charges made pursuant to subsection (j)'' are deposited (40:490(f)(1)(A)). That fund was subsequently named ``Federal Buildings Fund'' by section 153(1) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102ÿ09486, 106 Stat. 2851). If an exemption from charges is granted under 40:490(j), ``the fund'' that suffers the loss of revenue is the Federal Buildings Fund.

I21In subsection (d), the words ``on and after October 6, 1992'' are omitted as obsolete.

Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 does not contain a subsection (j) and the intended reference was probably ``section 210(j)'', which is restated in this section. The text of 40:490f(b) is omitted as executed.

I12(2) T4UseK._A telecommuting center may be used by employees of federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector. The Administrator shall give federal employees priority in using a telecommuting center. The Administrator may make a telecommuting center available for use by others to the extent it is not fully utilized by federal employees.

I12(3) T4User feesK._The Administrator shall charge a user fee for the use of a telecommuting center. The amount of the user fee shall approximate commercial charges for comparable space and services. However, the user fee may not be less than necessary to pay the cost of establishing and operating the telecommuting center, including the reasonable cost of renovation and replacement of furniture, fixtures, and equipment.

I12(4) T4Deposit and use of feesK._The Administrator may_

I13(A) deposit user fees into the Federal Buildings Fund and use the fees to pay costs incurred in establishing and operating the telecommuting center; and

I13(B) accept and retain income received by the General Services Administration, from federal agencies and non-federal sources, to defray costs directly associated with the functions of telecommuting centers.

Q04

I11(c) T4Development of Alternative Workplace Arrangements by Executive Agencies and Others._

I12(1) T4DefinitionK._In this subsection, the term ``alternative workplace arrangements'' includes telecommuting, hoteling, virtual offices, and other distributive work arrangements.

I12(2) T4Consideration by executive agenciesK._In considering whether to acquire space, quarters, buildings, or other facilities for use by employees, the head of an executive agency shall consider whether needs can be met using alternative workplace arrangements.

I12(3) T4Guidance from administratorK._The Administrator may provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to any person regarding the establishment and operation of alternative workplace arrangements.

Q04

I21T4SectionK 1. T3Purpose and general policyK. (a) The purpose of these regulations is to establish policies and procedures under which interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems may be established, operated, curtailed, or discontinued.

I21(b) The Administrator of General Services (hereinafter referred to as the Administrator) shall establish and provide for the operation of interagency motor-vehicle pools and systems for the purpose of providing more efficient or economical transportation of Government personnel and property within specific areas by motor vehicles or local transit systems. Pools or systems based in whole or in part upon use of privately-owned vehicles and facilities shall be preferred to Government ownership of vehicles and facilities to the extent that it is feasible to provide required motor-vehicle services of satisfactory quality and cost from commercial or other private sources.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3Conduct of studies to determine advisability of establishing motor-vehicle pools or systemsK. (a) The Administrator shall select areas in which studies are to be conducted to determine the advisability of establishing motor-vehicle pools or systems. Before initiating any such study, he shall give at least thirty days notice to the head of each executive agency (as defined in section 3(a) of the Act [now 40 U.S.C. 102(4)]). The notice shall include a statement of the approximate geographic area to be studied and the date on which the study will begin.

I21(b) The head of each executive agency receiving notice that such a study is to be made shall provide information which is required or pertinent. He shall also designate one or more officials in the field with whom members of a staff assigned by the General Services Administration may consult. Such designated officials shall provide such assigned staff with needed information and assistance, including reasonable opportunities to observe motor-vehicle operations and facilities and to examine pertinent cost and other records.

I21T4SecK. 3. T3Determination to establish an interagency motor-vehicle pool or systemK. (a) If the Administrator determines, with due regard to the program activities of the agencies concerned, and on the basis of a study made in accordance with section 2 hereof, that an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system should be established, he shall be responsible for preparing a formal determination to that effect. Such determination shall include:

I21(1) A description of the proposed operation, including a statement of the types of service and of the geographic area, and the agencies or parts of agencies to be served.

I21(2) The name of the executive agency designated to be responsible for operating the pool or system, and the reasons for such designation.

I21(3) A statement indicating the motor vehicles and related equipment and supplies to be transferred and the amount of reimbursement, if any, to be made therefor.

I21(b) Each determination shall be accompanied by an analytical justification which shall include a comparison of estimated costs of the present and proposed methods of operation and a showing of the estimated savings to be realized through the establishment of the proposed pool or system. The justification shall also describe the alternatives considered in making the determination, and shall include a statement concerning the availability of privately-owned facilities and equipment, and the feasibility and estimated cost (immediate and long-term) of using such facilities and equipment.

I21(c) The Administrator shall send a copy of each determination to each executive agency affected and to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget [now the Director of the Office of Management and Budget] (hereinafter referred to as the Director).

I21T4SecK. 4. T3Transfers of records, facilities, personnel, and appropriationsK. Whenever the Administrator prepares a determination as set forth in section 3 of these regulations, he shall also prepare and present to the Director a schedule of the proposed transfer of such records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations as relate primarily to the functions which are to be transferred to the interagency motor-vehicle pool or system. A copy of such schedule shall be sent by the Administrator to each executive agency affected. The Director shall determine the records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations to be transferred.

I21T4SecK. 5. T3Taking effect of determinationsK. Unless a greater time is allowed therein, any determination made by the Administrator shall become binding on all affected executive agencies forty-five days after the issuance thereof except with respect to any agency which appeals, or requests an exemption, from any such determination in accordance with section 6 of these regulations.

I21T4SecK. 6. T3Review of determinations not agreed to by agencies affectedK. (a) Any executive agency may appeal or request exemption from any or all proposals affecting it which are contained in a determination. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Director with a copy to the Administrator within forty-five days from the date of the determination. Such appeals shall be accompanied by factual and objective supporting data and justification.

I21(b) The Director shall review any determination from which an executive agency has appealed and shall make a final decision on such appeal. The Director shall make such decisions, within seventy-five days after he receives the appeal or as soon thereafter as practicable, on the basis of information contained in the Administrator's determination, the executive agencies' appeals therefrom, and any supplementary data submitted by the Administrator and the contesting agencies. The Director shall send copies of decisions to the Administrator and to the heads of other executive agencies concerned.

I21(c) The Director's decision upon each such appeal, if it holds that the determination shall apply in whole or in part to the appealing agency, shall state the extent to which the determination applies and the effective date of its application. To the extent that the Director's decision on an appeal does not uphold the Administrator's determination, such determination shall be of no force and effect.

I21T4SecK. 7. T3Compliance with determinations and decisions on appealsK. (a) When a determination or a decision on an appeal made in accordance with these regulations has become effective, each executive agency affected shall comply therewith.

I21(b) The Director shall take such actions as he deems appropriate to assist in securing compliance with determinations which have become effective. In the exercise of this authority to establish reserves in apportioning appropriations and funds, the Director shall take account of such savings as accrue from the establishment of inter-agency motor-vehicle pools and systems.

I21(c) The executive agency which operates any pool or system established hereunder shall maintain accurate records of the cost of establishment, maintenance, and operation of any interagency motor-vehicle pool or system established pursuant to these regulations.

I21(b) The Administrator may discontinue or curtail a motor-vehicle pool or system when he determines that it is not the most economical method of rendering required motor-vehicle service; but he shall give at least sixty days notice of such intention to executive agencies affected and to the Director before taking such action.

I21(c) Executive agencies affected by a pool or system for which the Administrator is responsible (including inter-agency pools or systems operated by another executive agency designated by the Administrator) may bring problems of service and cost to the attention of the Administrator, who shall assure that such problems receive proper attention.

I21(d) Executive agencies receiving motor-vehicle services from an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system under these regulations may request discontinuance or curtailment of their participation in such pool or system after at least one year of participation or in the event that the need for the services from the pool or system ceases. Such requests shall be submitted to the Administrator with pertinent factual justification.

I21(e) If the Administrator does not agree with such request and is unable to make arrangements which are mutually acceptable to him and to the head of the executive agency concerned, the agency's request for discontinuance or modification and the Administrator's reasons for not agreeing with the request shall be forwarded to the Director who shall be responsible for making a final and binding decision.

I21(f) When a pool or system is discontinued or curtailed, such transfers of vehicles and related equipment and supplies, personnel, records, facilities, and funds as may be appropriate will be made, subject to the approval of the Director.

I21T4SecK. 9. T3Motor vehicles exempted from inclusion in interagency motor-vehicle poolsK. The following-described classes of motor vehicles shall be exempt from inclusion in interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems:

I21(1) Motor vehicles designed or used for military field training, combat, or tactical purposes, or used principally within the confines of a regularly established military post, camp, or depot.

I21(2) Any motor vehicle regularly used by an agency in the performance of investigative, law enforcement, or intelligence duties if the head of such agency determines that exclusive control of such vehicle is essential to the effective performance of such duties: T3ProvidedK, that vehicles regularly used for common administrative purposes not directly connected with the performance of law enforcement, investigative, or intelligence duties shall not because of such use be exempted from such inclusion.

I21(3) Any motor vehicle the conspicuous identification of which as a Government vehicle would interfere with the purpose for which it is acquired and used.

I21(4) Unless inclusion is mutually agreed upon by the Administrator and the head of the agency concerned:

The special police may make arrests without warrant for any offense committed on the property if the police have reasonable grounds to believe the offense constitutes a felony under the laws of the United States and that the individual to be arrested is guilty of that offense.

I21``(f) T4AdministrativeK._The Administrator or an official of the Administration authorized by the Administrator may prescribe regulations necessary for the government of the property under their charge and control, and may annex to the regulations reasonable penalties, within the limits prescribed in subsection (g), that will ensure their enforcement.

I21Ex. Ord. No. 13006, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26071, provided:

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 T3et seqK.) and the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2505) [title I of Pub. L. 94ÿ09541, see Tables for classification], and in furtherance of and consistent with Executive Order No. 12072 of August 16, 1978 [40 U.S.C. 121 note], and Executive Order No. 11593 of May 13, 1971 [16 U.S.C. 470 note], it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3Statement of PolicyK. Through the Administration's community empowerment initiatives, the Federal Government has undertaken various efforts to revitalize our central cities, which have historically served as the centers for growth and commerce in our metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Administration hereby reaffirms the commitment set forth in Executive Order No. 12072 to strengthen our Nation's cities by encouraging the location of Federal facilities in our central cities. The Administration also reaffirms the commitments set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act to provide leadership in the preservation of historic resources, and in the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 to acquire and utilize space in suitable buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance.

I21To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties and districts, especially those located in our central business areas. When implementing these policies, the Federal Government shall institute practices and procedures that are sensible, understandable, and compatible with current authority and that impose the least burden on, and provide the maximum benefit to, society.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Central CitiesK. When operationally appropriate and economically prudent, and subject to the requirements of section 601 of title VI of the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3122) [now 7 U.S.C. 2204bÿ091], and Executive Order No. 12072, when locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies shall give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then Federal agencies shall consider other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal agencies shall then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order must be architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding historic district or properties.

I21T4SecK. 3. T3Identifying and Removing Regulatory BarriersK. Federal agencies with responsibilities for leasing, acquiring, locating, maintaining, or managing Federal facilities or with responsibilities for the planning for, or managing of, historic resources shall take steps to reform, streamline, and otherwise minimize regulations, policies, and procedures that impede the Federal Government's ability to establish or maintain a presence in historic districts or to acquire historic properties to satisfy Federal space needs, unless such regulations, policies, and procedures are designed to protect human health and safety or the environment. Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when taking these steps.

I21T4SecK. 4. T3Improving Preservation PartnershipsK. In carrying out the authorities of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Secretary of the Interior, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and each Federal agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with States, local governments, Indian tribes, and appropriate private organizations with the goal of enhancing participation of these parties in the National Historic Preservation Program. Such partnerships should embody the principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and increased service to the public.

I21T4SecK. 5. T3Judicial ReviewK. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

The words ``Council of the District of Columbia'' are substituted for ``Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia'' [subsequently changed to ``District of Columbia Council'' because of section 402(21), (28), (32), and (199) of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (eff. Nov. 3, 1967, 81 Stat. 952, 953, 963)] because of sections 401 and 404(a) of the Act (87 Stat. 785, 787).

I21In subsection (b)(1)(A), the words ``the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Chairman of the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives'' are substituted for ``and the chairman of the Committees of the District of Columbia of the Senate and the House of Representatives'' in section 2(b)(1) of the Act of June 24, 1924 (ch. 270), because of Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as amended by Senate Resolution 4 (popularly cited as the ``Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977''), approved February 4, 1977, section 1(b)(1) of the Act of June 3, 1995 (Public Law 104ÿ0914, 2:21 note prec.), and Rule X(1)(h) of House Resolution No. 5 (105th Congress, January 6, 1999).

I21In subsection (d), the words ``chapters 33 and 51, and subchapter III of chapter 53'' are substituted for ``the civil service and classification laws'' because of section 7(b) of the Act of September 6, 1966 (Public Law 89ÿ09554, 80 Stat. 631), the first section of which enacted Title 5, United States Code.

I21In subsection (e), before clause (1), the words ``As hereinafter more specifically described in sections 71c to 71g of this title'' are omitted as unnecessary. The text of 40:71a(e)(3) is omitted as obsolete because the National Capital Regional Planning Council was abolished by section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966 (eff. Sept. 8, 1966, 40:71b note). In clause (2), the words ``in such capacity'' are omitted as unnecessary.

See, also, page 180 of House Document No. 103ÿ097. The words ``Office of Management and Budget'' are substituted for ``Bureau of the Budget'' in section 13 of the Act of June 6, 1924, because the Bureau of the Budget was redesignated the Office of Management and Budget by section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (eff. July 1, 1970, 84 Stat. 2085). Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 was repealed by section 5(b) of the Act of September 13, 1982 (Public Law 97ÿ09258, 96 Stat. 1085), the first section of which enacted Title 31, United States Code, but the successor provision, 31:501, continued the designation as Office of Management and Budget.

I21In subsection (h), the words ``beginning in fiscal year 1998 and thereafter'' are omitted as obsolete.

I21The United States Government is the world's largest purchaser of computer-related services and equipment, purchasing more than $20 billion annually. At a time when a critical component in discussions with our international trading partners concerns their efforts to combat piracy of computer software and other intellectual property, it is incumbent on the United States to ensure that its own practices as a purchaser and user of computer software are beyond reproach. Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3PolicyK. It shall be the policy of the United States Government that each executive agency shall work diligently to prevent and combat computer software piracy in order to give effect to copyrights associated with computer software by observing the relevant provisions of international agreements in effect in the United States, including applicable provisions of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and relevant provisions of Federal law, including the Copyright Act.

I21(2) determining what computer software the agency has the authorization to use; and

I21(3) developing and maintaining adequate recordkeeping systems.

I21(c) Contractors and recipients of Federal financial assistance, including recipients of grants and loan guarantee assistance, should have appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure that Federal funds are not used to acquire, operate, or maintain computer software in violation of applicable copyright laws. If agencies become aware that contractors or recipients are using Federal funds to acquire, operate, or maintain computer software in violation of copyright laws and determine that such actions of the contractors or recipients may affect the integrity of the agency's contracting and Federal financial assistance processes, agencies shall take such measures, including the use of certifications or written assurances, as the agency head deems appropriate and consistent with the requirements of law.

I21(d) Executive agencies shall cooperate fully in implementing this order and shall share information as appropriate that may be useful in combating the use of computer software in violation of applicable copyright laws.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3Responsibilities of Agency HeadsK. In connection with the acquisition and use of computer software, the head of each executive agency shall:

I21(a) ensure agency compliance with copyright laws protecting computer software and with the provisions of this order to ensure that only authorized computer software is acquired for and used on the agency's computers;

I21(b) utilize performance measures as recommended by the Chief Information Officers Council pursuant to section 3 of this order to assess the agency's compliance with this order;

I21(c) educate appropriate agency personnel regarding copyrights protecting computer software and the policies and procedures adopted by the agency to honor them; and

I21(d) ensure that the policies, procedures, and practices of the agency related to copyrights protecting computer software are adequate and fully implement the policies set forth in this order.

I21T4SecK. 3. T3Chief Information Officers CouncilK. The Chief Information Officers Council (``Council'') established by section 3 of Executive Order No. 13011 of July 16, 1996 [set out above], shall be the principal interagency forum to improve executive agency practices regarding the acquisition and use of computer software, and monitoring and combating the use of unauthorized computer software. The Council shall provide advice and make recommendations to executive agencies and to the Office of Management and Budget regarding appropriate government-wide measures to carry out this order. The Council shall issue its initial recommendations within 6 months of the date of this order.

I21T4SecK. 4. T3Office of Management and BudgetK. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in carrying out responsibilities under the Clinger-Cohen Act [probably means the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, div. D (ÿ1A4001ÿ094402) and div. E (ÿ1A5001ÿ095703) of Pub. L. 104ÿ09106, see Tables for classification], shall utilize appropriate oversight mechanisms to foster agency compliance with the policies set forth in this order. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Director shall consider any recommendations made by the Council under section 3 of this order regarding practices and policies to be instituted on a government-wide basis to carry out this order.

I21T4SecK. 7. T3Law Enforcement ActivitiesK. Nothing in this order shall be construed to require the disclosure of law enforcement investigative sources or methods or to prohibit or otherwise impair any lawful investigative or protective activity undertaken for or by any officer, agent, or employee of the United States or any person acting pursuant to a contract or other agreement with such entities.

I21T4SecK. 8. T3ScopeK. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the interpretation, application, or operation of 28 U.S.C. 1498.

This Executive order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

I89. Findings and purposes

I11(a) 1965 T4Findings and Purpose._

I12(1) T4FindingsK._Congress finds and declares that the Appalachian region of the United States, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of the Nation in its economic growth and that its people have not shared properly in the Nation's prosperity. The region's uneven past development, with its historical reliance on a few basic industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the economic base that is a vital prerequisite for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. State and local governments and the people of the region understand their problems and have been working, and will continue to work, purposefully toward their solution. Congress recognizes the comprehensive report of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission documenting these findings and concludes that regionwide development is feasible, desirable, and urgently needed.

I12(2) T4PurposeK._It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the region in meeting its special problems, to promote its economic development, and to establish a framework for joint federal and state efforts toward providing the basic facilities essential to its growth and attacking its common problems and meeting its common needs on a coordinated and concerted regional basis. The public investments made in the region under this subtitle shall be concentrated in areas where there is a significant potential for future growth and where the expected return on public dollars invested will be the greatest. States will be responsible for recommending local and state projects within their borders that will receive assistance under this subtitle. As the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources, Congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry and that the region will then be able to support itself through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy.

Q04

I11(b) 1975 T4Findings and Purpose._

I12(1) T4FindingsK._Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the purposes set out in subsection (a), especially with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region but also its relationship to a nation that on December 31, 1975, is assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia as of December 31, 1975, has the opportunity, in accommodating future growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and coordinated planning so that housing, public services, transportation and other community facilities will be provided in a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of life for the people of the region, and consistent with that goal, the Appalachian region should be able to take advantage of eco-industrial development, which promotes both employment and economic growth and the preservation of natural resources. Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring in national energy requirements and production, which not only risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs to the region and its people.

I12(2) T4PurposeK._It is also the purpose of this subtitle to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state and local efforts toward_

I13(A) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices;

I13(B) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs; and

I13(C) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by federal, state, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation's energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, community facilities, and human services.

Q04

I11(c) 1998 T4Findings and PurposeK._

I12(1) T4FindingsK._Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made in fulfilling many of the objectives of this subtitle, rapidly changing national and global economies over the decade ending November 13, 1998, have created new problems and challenges for rural areas throughout the United States and especially for the Appalachian region.

I12(2) T4PurposeK._In addition to the purposes stated in subsections (a) and (b), it is the purpose of this subtitle_

I13(A) to assist the Appalachian region in_

I14(i) providing the infrastructure necessary for economic and human resource development;

I14(ii) developing the region's industry;

I14(iii) building entrepreneurial communities;

I14(iv) generating a diversified regional economy; and

I11A State or political subdivision of a State is not eligible to receive benefits under this subtitle unless the aggregate expenditure of state amounts, except expenditures for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and local and federal amounts, for the benefit of the area within the State located in the Appalachian region is maintained at a level which does not fall below the average level of those expenditures for the State's last two full fiscal years prior to March 9, 1965. In computing the level, a State's past expenditure for participation in the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways and expenditures of local and federal amounts shall not be included. The Commission shall recommend to the President a lesser requirement when it finds that a substantial population decrease in that part of a State which lies within the region would not justify a state expenditure equal to the average level of the last two years or when it finds that a State's average level of expenditure in an individual program has been disproportionate to the present need for that part of the State.

I11In this chapter, the following definitions apply:

I12(1) T4Executive agencyK._The term ``executive agency''_

I13(A) means an executive agency (as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5) that operates at least 300 motor vehicles; but

Q04

I12(2) T4Motor vehicleK._The term ``motor vehicle'' means_

I13(A) a vehicle self-propelled or drawn by mechanical power; but not

I21In this section, the text of 40:913(2)ÿ09(4) is omitted as unnecessary because the complete names of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Administrator of General Services, and the Comptroller General of the United States are used the first time the terms appear in a section.

I21Before clause (1), the words ``this chapter'' were in the original ``this title'', meaning title XV (ÿ1A15101 to 15313) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99ÿ09272, 100 Stat. 330). In clause (2)(B), the words ``this chapter'' are substituted for ``this part'' as the probable intent of Congress because title XV of the Act does not contain part designations and the intention was probably to refer to title XV, which is restated as this chapter.

I12(1) T4Federal agencyK._The term ``federal agency'' means a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.

I12(2) T4Federally generated electric energyK._The term ``federally generated electric energy'' means any electric power generated by an electric generating facility owned and operated by a federal agency.

e

I21In clause (1), the definition of ``agency'' as referring to the head of any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States Government is rewritten as a definition of ``federal agency'' to avoid confusion between the role of the ``agency'' and the ``head of the agency''. Throughout the chapter, the words ``head of the federal agency'' are used when the source provision is referring to action taken by an official as opposed to the concept of the agency as an institution.

I21In clause (3), the text of 40:795(1) and (4) is combined to eliminate a definition (40:795(1)) that is used only once.

I89. Sale of electric energy

I11(a) T4In GeneralK._To conserve oil and natural gas and better utilize coal, the head of a federal agency may sell, or enter into a contract to sell, to any non-federal person electric energy generated by coal-fired electric generating facilities of that agency in Alaska without regard to any provision of law that precludes the sale when the electric energy to be sold is available from other local sources, if the head of the federal agency determines that_

I12(1) the electric energy to be sold is generated by an existing coal-fired generating facility;

I12(2) the electric energy to be sold is surplus to the federal agency's needs and is in excess of the electric energy specifically generated for consumption by, or necessary to serve the requirements of, another federal agency;

I12(3) the cost to the ultimate consumers of the electric energy to be sold is less than the cost that, in the absence of the sale, would be incurred by those consumers for the purchase of an equivalent amount of energy; and

I12(4) the sale will reduce the total consumption of oil or natural gas by the non-federal person purchasing the electric energy below the level of consumption that would occur in the absence of the sale.

Q04

I11(b) T4Pricing PoliciesK._Federally generated electric energy sold by the head of a federal agency under subsection (a) shall be priced to recover the fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs of the facility generating the energy that are attributable to that sale, plus an amount equal to one-half the difference between_

I12(1) the costs of producing the electric energy by coal generation; and

I12(2) the costs of producing electric energy by the oil or gas generation being displaced.

I89. Purchase of electric power

I11For purposes of economy, efficiency, and conserving oil and natural gas, the head of a federal agency, when practicable and consistent with other laws and requirements applicable to that agency, shall endeavor to purchase electric energy from a non-federal person for consumption in Alaska by a facility of that agency when (taking into account the remaining useful life of any facility available to that agency to generate electric energy for that agency and the cost of maintaining the facility on a standby basis) the purchase will result in_

I12(1) a savings to other consumers of electric energy sold by that non-federal person without increasing the cost incurred by any federal agency for electric energy; or

I12(2) a cost savings to the federal agency purchasing the electric energy without increasing costs to other consumers of electric energy.

I11(a) T4Accommodation of Needs for Electric EnergyK._This chapter does not require or authorize a federal agency to construct a new electric generating facility or related facility, to modify an existing facility, or to employ reserve or standby equipment to accommodate the needs of a non-federal person for electric energy.

I11(b) T4Availability of Revenue From SalesK._Revenue received by a federal agency pursuant to section 17902 of this title from the sale of electric energy generated from a facility of that agency is available to the agency without fiscal year limitation to purchase fuel and for operation, maintenance, and other costs associated with that facility.

I11(c) T4Exercise of AuthoritiesK._The authority under this chapter shall be exercised for those periods and pursuant to terms and conditions that the head of the federal agency concerned decides are necessary consistent with_

I12(1) this chapter; and

I12(2) responsibilities of the head of the federal agency under other law.

Q04

I11(d) T4Negotiation and Execution of Contracts and Other AgreementsK._A contract or other agreement executed under this chapter shall be negotiated and executed by the head of the federal agency selling or purchasing electric energy under this chapter.

I89. Findings and purposes

I11(a) T4FindingsK._Congress finds that_

I12(1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital;

I12(2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than two-thirds of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;

I12(3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation;

I12(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;

I12(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;

I12(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and

I12(7) federal legislation is necessary under section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace.

Q04

I11(b) T4PurposeK._The purpose of this chapter is to adopt standards governing arbitration that must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.

Q04

I11(b) T4Factors in Making Arbitration AwardK._An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:

I12(1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit.

I12(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.

I12(4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit.

I12(5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.

I12(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including_

I11(d) T4Requirements for Final Award._

I12(1) T4Written awardK._In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (b) and (c) have been considered and applied.

I12(2) T4PrerequisitesK._An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare.
