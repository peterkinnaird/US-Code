<p class="note-body">In the second sentence of this section, provisions that authorized the appointment of a Deputy Director and that authorized the employment of certified public accountants, qualified cost accountants, industrial engineers, appraisers, and other experts without regard to &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1923&rdquo;, were omitted as obsolete. Sections 1202 and 1204 of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 972, 973, repealed the 1923 Act and all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the 1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this sentence because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was repealed by Pub. L. 89&ndash;554, Sept. 6, 1966, &sect;8(a), 80 Stat. 632 (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5 into law). Section 5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949 Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and employees.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;106. Basis for settlement of termination claims</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Priority to private contractors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Government, and it shall be the responsibility of the contracting agencies and the Administrator of General Services to provide war contractors with speedy and fair compensation for the termination of any war contract, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter, giving priority to contractors whose facilities are privately owned or privately operated. Such fair compensation for the termination of subcontracts shall be based on the same principles as compensation for the termination of prime contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of methods and standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each contracting agency shall establish methods and standards, suitable to the conditions of various war contractors, for determining fair compensation for the termination of war contracts on the basis of actual, standard, average, <!-- PDFPage:37 -->or estimated costs, or of a percentage of the contract price based on the estimated percentage of completion of work under the terminated contract, or on any other equitable basis, as it deems appropriate. To the extent that such methods and standards require accounting, they shall be adapted, so far as practicable, to the accounting systems used by war contractors, if consistent with recognized commercial accounting practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conclusiveness of settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may settle all or any part of any termination claim under any war contract by agreement with the war contractor, or by determination of the amount due on the claim or part thereof without such agreement, or by any combination of these methods. Where any such settlement is made by agreement, the settlement shall be final and conclusive, except (1) to the extent otherwise agreed in the settlement; (2) for fraud; (3) upon renegotiation to eliminate excessive profits under section 1191 of Appendix to title 50, unless exempt or exempted under such section; or (4) by mutual agreement before or after payment. Where any such settlement is made by determination without agreement, it shall likewise be final and conclusive, subject to the same exceptions as if made by agreement, unless the war contractor appeals or brings suit in accordance with section 113 of this title: <em>Provided,</em> That no settlement agreement hereunder involving payment to a war contractor of an amount in excess of $50,000 (or such lesser amount as the Administrator of General Services may from time to time determine) shall become binding upon the Government until the agreement has been reviewed and approved by a settlement review board of three or more members established by the contracting agency in the bureau, division, regional or district office, or other unit of the contracting agency authorized to make such settlement, or in the event of disapproval by the settlement review board, unless approved by the head of such bureau, division, regional or district office, or other unit. Failure of the settlement review board to act upon any settlement within thirty days after its submission to the board shall operate as approval by the board. The sole function of settlement review boards shall be to determine the over-all reasonableness of proposed settlement agreements from the point of view of protecting the interests of the Government. In determining, for purposes of this subsection, whether review of any settlement agreement is required because of the amounts involved, no deduction shall be made on account of credits for property chargeable to the Government or for advance or partial payments, but amounts payable under such settlement agreement for completed articles or work at the contract price and for the discharge of the termination claims of subcontractors shall be deducted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allowable costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as hereinafter provided, the methods and standards established under subsection (b) of this section for determining fair compensation for termination claims which are not settled by agreement shall be designed to compensate the war contractor fairly for the termination of the war contract, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the direct and indirect manufacturing, selling and distribution, administrative and other costs and expenses incurred by the war contractor which are reasonably necessary for the performance of the war contract and properly allocable to the terminated portion thereof under recognized commercial accounting practices; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reasonable costs and expenses of settling termination claims of subcontractors related to the terminated portion of the war contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reasonable accounting, legal, clerical, and other costs and expenses incident to termination and settlement of the terminated war contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) reasonable costs and expenses of removing, preserving, storing and disposing of termination inventories; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such allowance for profit on the preparations made and work done for the terminated portion of the war contract as is reasonable under the circumstances; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) interest on the termination claim in accordance with subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the contract price and all amounts otherwise paid or payable under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The following shall not be included as elements of cost:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Losses on other contracts, or from sales or exchanges of capital assets, fees and other expenses in connection with reorganization or recapitalization, antitrust or Federal income-tax litigation, or prosecution of Federal income-tax claims or other claims against the Government (except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection); losses on investments; provisions for contingencies; and premiums on life insurance where the contractor is the beneficiary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The expense of conversion of the contractor's facilities to uses other than the performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Expenses due to the negligence or willful failure of the contractor to discontinue with reasonable promptness the incurring of expenses after the effective date of the termination notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Costs incurred in respect to facilities, materials, or services purchased or work done in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirements of the entire contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The failure specifically to mention in this subsection any item of cost is not intended to imply that it should be allowed or disallowed. The Administrator of General Services may interpret the provisions of this subsection and may provide for the inclusion or exclusion of other costs in accordance with recognized commercial accounting practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the small size of claims or the nature of production or performance or other factors make it impracticable to apply the principles stated in this subsection to any class of settlements which are subject to this subsection, the contracting agencies may establish alternative methods and standards for determining fair <!-- PDFPage:38 -->compensation for that class of termination claims. The aggregate amount of compensation allowed in accordance with this subsection (excluding amounts allowed under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection) shall not exceed the total contract price reduced by the amount of payments otherwise made or to be made under the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Settlement by agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the objectives of this chapter, termination claims shall be settled by agreement to the maximum extent feasible and the methods and standards established under subsection (b) of this section shall be designed to facilitate such settlements. To the extent that he deems it practicable to do so without impeding expeditious settlements, the Administrator of General Services shall require the contracting agencies to take into account the factors enumerated in subsection (d) of this section in establishing methods and standards for determining fair compensation in the settlement of termination claims by agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each contracting agency shall allow and pay interest on the amount due and unpaid from time to time on any termination claim under a prime contract at the rate of 21/2 per centum per annum for the period beginning thirty days after the date fixed for termination and ending with the date of final payment, except that (1) if the prime contractor unreasonably delays the settlement of his claim, interest shall not accrue for the period of such delay, (2) if interest for the period after termination on any advance payment or loan, made or guaranteed by the Government, has been waived for the benefit of the contractor, the amount of the interest so waived allocable to the terminated contract or the terminated part of the contract shall be deducted from the interest otherwise payable hereunder, and (3) if after delivery of findings by a contracting agency, the contractor appeals or sues as provided in section 113 of this title, interest shall not accrue after the thirtieth day following the delivery of the findings on any amount allowed by such findings, unless such amount is increased upon such appeal or suit. In approving, ratifying, authorizing, or making termination settlements with subcontractors, each contracting agency shall allow interest on the termination claim of the subcontractor on the same basis and subject to the same conditions as are applicable to a prime contractor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Amendment of contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where any war contract does not provide for or provides against such fair compensation for its termination, the contracting agency, either before or after its termination, shall amend such war contract by agreement with the war contractor, or shall authorize, approve, or ratify an amendment of such war contract by the parties thereto, to provide for such fair compensation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;107. Settlement of subcontractors&rsquo; claims</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conclusiveness of settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where, in connection with the settlement of any termination claim by a contracting agency, any war contractor makes settlements of the termination claims of his subcontractors, the contracting agency shall limit or omit its review of such settlements with subcontractors to the maximum extent compatible with the public interest. Any contracting agency (1) may approve, ratify, or authorize such settlements with subcontractors upon such evidence, terms, and conditions as it deems proper; (2) shall vary the scope and intensity of its review of such settlements according to the reliability of the war contractor, the size, number, and complexity of such claims, and other relevant factors; and (3) shall authorize war contractors to make such settlements with subcontractors without review by the contracting agency, whenever the reliability of the war contractor, the amount or nature of the claims, or other reasons appear to the contracting agency to justify such action. Any such settlement of a subcontract approved, ratified, or authorized by a contracting agency <!-- PDFPage:39 -->shall be final and conclusive as to the amount due to the same extent as a settlement under subsection (c) of section 106 of this title, and no war contractor shall be liable to the United States on account of any amounts paid thereon except for his own fraud.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supervision of payments to war contractors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any contracting agency is satisfied of the inability of a war contractor to meet his obligations it shall exercise supervision or control over payments to the war contractor on account of termination claims of subcontractors of such war contractor to such extent and in such manner as it deems necessary or desirable for the purpose of assuring the receipt of the benefit of such payments by the subcontractors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Group settlements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe policies and methods for the settlement as a group, or otherwise, by any contracting agency of some or all of the termination claims of a war contractor under war contracts with one or more (1) bureaus or divisions within a contracting agency, (2) contracting agencies, or (3) prime contractors and subcontractors, to the extent he deems such action necessary or desirable for expeditious and equitable settlement of such claims. After consulting with the contracting agencies concerned, the Administrator of General Services may provide for assigning any war contractor to a contracting agency for such settlement, and such agency shall have authority to settle, on behalf of any other contracting agency, some or all of the termination claims of such war contractor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Direct settlement by contracting agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may settle directly termination claims of subcontractors to the extent that it deems such action necessary or desirable for the expeditious and equitable settlement of such claims. In making such termination settlements any contracting agency may discharge the claim of the subcontractor by payment or may purchase such claim, and may agree to assume, or indemnify the subcontractor against, any claims by any person in connection with such claim or the termination settlement. Any contracting agency undertaking to settle the termination claim of any subcontractor shall deliver to the subcontractor and the war contractor liable to him written notice stating its acceptance of responsibility for settling his claim and the conditions applicable thereto, which may include the release, or assignment to the contracting agency, of his claim against the war contractor liable to him; upon consent thereto by the subcontractor, the Government shall become liable for the settlement of his claims upon the conditions specified in the notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may make settlements with subcontractors in accordance with any of the provisions of this chapter without regard to any limitation on the amount payable by the Government to the prime contractor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Equitable payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any contracting agency determines that in the circumstances of a particular case equity and good conscience require fair compensation for the termination of a war contract to be paid to a subcontractor who has been deprived of and cannot otherwise reasonably secure such fair compensation, the contracting agency concerned may pay such compensation to him although such compensation already has been included and paid as part of a settlement with another war contractor.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;108. Interim financing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prime contractors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Government, and it shall be the responsibility of the contracting agencies and the Administrator of General Services, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter, to provide war contractors having any termination claim or claims, pending their settlement, with adequate interim financing, within thirty days after proper application therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of financing; amounts payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each contracting agency shall, to the greatest extent it deems practicable, make available interim financing through loans and discounts, and commitments and guaranties in connection therewith, in contemplation of or related to termination of war contracts. Where interim financing is made by advance payments or partial payments, it shall, insofar as practicable, consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An amount equal to 100 per centum of the amount payable, at the contract price, on account of acceptable items completed prior to the termination date under the terms of the contract, or completed thereafter with the approval of the contracting agency; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An amount equal to 90 per centum of the cost of raw materials, purchased parts, supplies, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead allocable to the terminated portion of the war contract; plus</p>
<!-- PDFPage:40 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A reasonable percentage of other allowable costs, including administrative overhead, allocable to the terminated portion of the war contract not included in the foregoing; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Such additional amounts, if any, as the contracting agency deems necessary to provide the war contractor with adequate interim financing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In lieu of the costs referred to in clauses (2) and (3) of this subsection, where a detailed ascertainment of such costs is not suitable to the conditions of any war contractor and is apt to cause delay in the obtaining of interim financing by him, that portion of such interim financing shall be equal to an amount not greater than 90 per centum of the estimated costs which are allocable to the terminated part or parts of the war contract or group of war contracts, and are ascertained in accordance with such methods and standards as the Administrator of General Services shall prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) There shall be deducted from the amount of such interim financing any unliquidated balances of advance and partial payments theretofore made to such war contractor, which are allocable to the terminated war contract or the terminated part of the war contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Evidence to support financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe (1) the types of estimates, certificates, or other evidence to be required to support such interim financing; (2) the terms and conditions upon which such interim financing shall be made including the use of standard forms for agreements with respect to such interim financing to the extent practicable; (3) the classes of cases in which such interim financing shall be refused; and (4) such methods of supervision and control over such interim financing as he deems necessary or desirable to assure adequate and speedy interim financing to subcontractors of the war contractor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Penalty for overstatement of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case of an overstatement by any war contractor of the amount due on his termination claim or claims in connection with any interim financing under this chapter, such contractor shall pay to the United States, as a penalty, an amount equal to 6 per centum of the amount of the overstatement, but the Administrator of General Services may suspend or modify any such penalty if in his opinion the imposition thereof would be inequitable. Any penalty may be deducted from any amounts due the war contractor upon such termination claim or claims, or otherwise, or may be collected from the war contractor by suit. The obligation to pay any penalty imposed and to repay any interim financing made or assumed by the United States under this chapter shall constitute a debt due to the United States within the meaning of section 3713(a) of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Advance payments as part of termination settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may allow any advance payments, previously made or authorized by it in connection with the performance of a war contract, to be used for payments and expenses related to the termination settlement of such contract, upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate to protect the interest of the Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Liquidation of loans, etc., prior to final settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No interim financing shall be made by any contracting agency under this chapter unless the terms of such financing provide for the liquidation by the war contractor of all loans, discounts, advance payments, or partial payments thereunder not later than the time of final payment of the amount due on the settlement of the termination claim or claims of the war contractor involved or such time thereafter as the contracting agency deems necessary for the liquidation of such interim financing in an orderly manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Settlement of claims; validation of prior financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may settle, upon such terms and conditions as it deems proper, any claim or obligation due by or to the Government arising from or related to any interim financing made, acquired, or authorized by it. Any interim financing made, acquired, or authorized by any contracting agency before July 21, 1944, shall be valid to the extent it would be authorized under the provisions of this chapter if made after its effective date.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;112. Removal and storage of materials</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Termination inventory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Government, upon the termination of any war contract, to assure the expeditious removal from the plant of the war contractor of the termination inventory not to be retained or sold by the war contractor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement on material of inventory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any war contractor may submit to the contracting agency concerned or to any other Government agency designated by the Administrator of General Services, one or more statements showing the materials which such war contractor claims to be termination inventory under one or more war contracts and desires to have removed by the Government. Such statements shall be prepared in such form and detail, shall be submitted in such manner, through the prime contractor or otherwise, and shall be supported by such certificates or other data, as may be prescribed under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Removal and storage by Government agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within sixty days after the submission of any such statement by a war contractor, or such shorter period as may be prescribed under this chapter, or within such longer period as the war contractor may agree, the Government agency concerned (1) shall arrange, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed, for the storage by the war contractor on his own premises or elsewhere of all such claimed termination inventory which the war contractor does not retain or dispose of, except any part which may be determined not to be allocable to the terminated war contract or contracts, or (2) shall remove from the plant or plants of the war contractor all of such claimed termination inventory not retained, disposed of, or stored by the war contractor or determined not to be allocable to the terminated war contract or contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Removal and storage by war contractor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the failure of the Government so to arrange for storage by the war contractor or to remove any termination inventory within the period specified under subsection (c) of this section, the war contractor, subject to regulations prescribed under this chapter, may remove some or all of such termination inventory from his plant or plants and may store it on his own premises or elsewhere for the account and at the risk and expense of the Government, using reasonable care for its transportation and preservation. If any war contractor intends so to remove any claimed termination inventory, he shall deliver to the Government agency concerned written notice of the date fixed for removal and a statement showing the quantities and condition of the materials so to be removed, certified on behalf of the war contractor to have been prepared in accordance with a concurrent physical inventory of such materials. Such notice and statement shall be delivered at least twenty days in advance of the date fixed for removal and may be delivered before or after the expiration of the period specified under subsection (c) of this section. If the Government agency fails to check such materials, at or before the time of their removal by the war contractor, a certificate of the war contractor specifying the materials shown on such statement which were so removed, and filed with the Government agency concerned within thirty days after the date fixed for removal, shall constitute prima facie evidence against the United States as to the quantities and condition of the materials so removed, and the fact of their removal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Acquisition by Government agency of inventory material; liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, but subject to subsection (h) of this section, the contracting agency concerned or the Administrator of General Services, or any Government agency designated by him, on behalf of the United States, may, by the exercise of any contract rights or otherwise, acquire and take possession of any termination inventory of any war contractor, and any materials removed by the Government or stored for its account under subsections (c) and (d) of this section, whether or not such materials are finally determined not to <!-- PDFPage:43 -->constitute termination inventory. With respect to any such materials, the Government shall be liable to any war contractor concerned only for their return to such war contractor or for their disposal value at the time of their removal or for the proceeds realized by the Government from their disposal, at the election of the Government agency concerned, unless the Government agency and the war contractor agree or have agreed on a different basis. Any amount so paid or layable to a war contractor for materials allocable to a terminated war contract shall be credited against the termination claim under such contract but shall not otherwise affect the amount due on the claim, unless the Government agency concerned and the war contractor agree or have agreed otherwise. Any materials to which the Administrator of General Services takes title under this section shall be delivered for disposal to any appropriate Government agency authorized to make such disposal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Postponement or delay of termination settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No contracting agency shall postpone or delay any termination settlement beyond the period specified in subsection (c) of this section for the purpose of awaiting disposal by the war contractor or the Government of any termination inventory reported in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Government-owned machinery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any war contractor no longer requires, for the performance of any war contract, any Government-owned machinery, tools, or equipment installed in his plant for the performance of one or more war contracts, the Government agency concerned, upon written demand by the war contractor, and within sixty days after such demand or such other period as may be prescribed under this chapter, and upon such conditions as may be so prescribed, shall remove or provide for the removal of such machinery, tools, or equipment from such plant, unless the Government agency concerned and the war contractor, by facilities contract or otherwise, have made or make other provisions for the retention, storage, maintenance, or disposition of such machinery, tools or equipment. The Government agency concerned may waive or release on behalf of the United States any obligation of the war contractor with respect to such machinery, tools, or equipment upon such terms and conditions as the agency deems appropriate. Upon the failure of the Government so to remove or provide for removal of any such machinery, tools, or equipment, the war contractor, subject to regulations prescribed under this chapter, may remove all or part of such machinery, tools, or equipment from his plant and may store it on his own premises or elsewhere, for the account and at the risk and expense of the Government, using reasonable care for its transportation and preservation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Limitation on Government acquisition of inventories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of the Department of the Army, Department of the Air Force, Navy Department, or the Department of Transportation, respectively, to take over any termination inventories and to retain them for their use for any purpose or to dispose of such termination inventories for the purpose of war production, or to authorize any war contractor to retain or dispose of such termination inventories for the purpose of war production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Removal and storage by war contractor at own risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the removal and storage of any termination inventory by any war contractor, at his own risk, at any time after termination of any war contract to which it is allocable.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Failure to settle claims by agreement; preparation of findings; notice to war contractor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the contracting agency responsible for settling any termination claim has not settled the claim by agreement or has so settled <!-- PDFPage:44 -->only a part of the claim, (1) the contracting agency at any time may determine the amount due on such claim or such unsettled part, and prepare written findings indicating the basis of the determination, and deliver a copy of such findings to the war contractor, or (2) if the termination claim has been submitted in the manner and substantially the form prescribed under this chapter, the contracting agency, upon written demand by the war contractor for such findings, shall determine the amount due on the claim or unsettled part and prepare and deliver such findings to the war contractor within ninety days after the receipt by the agency of such demand. In preparing such findings, the contracting agency may require the war contractor to furnish such information and to submit to such audits as may be reasonably necessary for that purpose. Within thirty days after the delivery of any such findings, the contracting agency shall pay to the war contractor at least 90 per centum of the amount thereby determined to be due, after deducting the amount of any outstanding interim financing applicable thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rights of war contractor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any war contractor is aggrieved by the findings of a contracting agency on his claim or part thereof or by its failure to make such findings in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, he may bring suit against the United States for such claim or such part thereof, in the United States Court of Federal Claims or in a United States district court, in accordance with sections 1346, 2401, and 2402 of title 28, except that, if the contracting agency is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, or any corporation organized pursuant to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, or any corporation owned or controlled by the United States, the suit shall be brought against such corporation in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with existing law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any proceeding under subsection (b) of this section shall be governed by the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) When any contracting agency provides a procedure within the agency for protest against such findings or for other appeal therefrom by the war contractor, the war contractor, before proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, (i) in his discretion may resort to such procedure within the time specified in his contract or, if no time is specified, within thirty days after the delivery to him of the findings; and (ii) shall resort to such procedure for protest or other appeal to the extent required by the Administrator of General Services, but failure of the contracting agency to act on any such required protest or appeal within thirty days shall operate as a refusal by the agency to modify its findings. Any revision of the findings by the contracting agency, upon protest or appeal within the agency, shall be treated as the findings of the agency for the purpose of appeal or suit under subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract, no war contractor shall be required to protest or appeal from such findings within the contracting agency except in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A war contractor may initiate proceedings in accordance with subsection (b) of this section (i) within ninety days after delivery to him of the findings by the contracting agency, or (ii) in case of protests or appeal within the agency, within ninety days after the determination of such protest or appeal, or (iii) in case of failure to deliver such findings, within one year after his demand therefor. If he does not initiate such proceedings within the time specified, he shall be precluded thereafter from initiating any proceedings in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, and the findings of the contracting agency shall be final and conclusive, or if no findings were made, he shall be deemed to have waived such termination claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract, the court shall not be bound by the findings of the contracting agency, but shall treat such findings as prima facie correct, and the burden shall be on the war contractor to establish that the amount due on his claim or part thereof exceeds the amount allowed by the findings of the contracting agency. Whenever the court finds that the war contractor failed to negotiate in good faith with the contracting agency for the settlement of his claim or part thereof before appeal or suit thereon, or failed to furnish to the agency any information reasonably requested by it regarding his termination claim or part thereof, or failed to prosecute diligently any protest or appeal required to be taken under subsection (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the court (i) may refuse to receive in evidence any information not submitted to the contracting agency; (ii) may deny interest on the claim or part thereof for such period as it deems proper; or (iii) may remand the case to the contracting agency for further proceedings upon such terms as the court may prescribe. Unless the case is remanded, the court shall enter the appropriate award or judgment on the basis of the law and facts, and may increase or decrease the amount allowed by the findings of the contracting agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any such proceedings shall not affect the authority of the contracting agency concerned to make a settlement of the termination claim, or any part thereof, by agreement with the war contractor at any time before such proceedings are concluded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Arbitration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The contracting agency responsible for settling any claim and the war contractor asserting the claim, by agreement, may submit all or any part of the termination claim to arbitration, without regard to the amount in dispute. Such arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of United States Arbitration Act to the same extent as if authorized by an effective agreement in writing between the Government and the war contractor. Any such arbitration award shall be final and conclusive upon the United States to the same extent as a settlement under subsection (c) of section 106 of this <!-- PDFPage:45 -->title, but shall not be subject to approval by any settlement review board.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Conclusiveness of decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any dispute exists between any war contractor and a subcontractor regarding any termination claim, either of them, by agreement with the other, may submit the dispute to a contracting agency for mediation or arbitration whenever authorized by the agency or required by the Administrator of General Services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Any award or decision in such proceedings shall be final and conclusive as to the parties so submitting any such dispute and shall not be questioned by the United States in settling any related claim, in the absence of fraud or collusion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of expediting the adjudication of termination claims, the United States Court of Federal Claims is authorized to appoint not more than ten auditors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Court of Federal Claims, on motion of either of the parties, or on its own motion, may summon any and all persons with legal capacity to be sued to appear as a party or parties in any suit or proceeding of any nature whatsoever pending in said court to assert and defend their interests, if any, in such suits or proceedings, within such period of time prior to judgment as the United States Court of Federal Claims shall prescribe. If the name and address of any such person is known or can be ascertained by reasonable diligence, and if he resides within the jurisdiction of the United States, he shall be summoned to appear by personal service; but if any such person resides outside of the jurisdiction of the United States, or is unknown, or if for any other good and sufficient reason appearing to the court personal service cannot be had, he may be summoned by publication, under such rules as the court may adopt, together with a copy of the summons mailed by registered mail to such person's last known address. The United States Court of Federal Claims may, upon motion of the Attorney General, in any suit or proceeding where there may be any number of persons having possible interests therein, notify such persons to appear to assert and defend such interests. Upon failure so to appear, any and all claims or interests in claims of any such person against the United States, in respect of the subject matter of such suit or proceeding, shall forever be barred and the court shall have jurisdiction to enter judgment pro confesso upon any claim or contingent claim asserted on behalf of the United States against any person who, having been duly served with summons, fails to respond thereto, to the same extent and with like effect as if such person had appeared and had admitted the truth of all allegations made on behalf of the United States. Upon appearance by any person pursuant to any such summons or notice, the case as to such person shall, for all purposes, be treated as if an independent proceeding has been instituted by such person pursuant to sections 1491, 1496, 1501, 1503, and 2501 of title 28, and as if such independent proceeding had then been consolidated, for purposes of trial and determination, with the case in respect of which the summons or notice was issued, except that the United States shall not be heard upon any counterclaims, claims for damages or other demands whatsoever against such person, other than claims and contingent claims for the recovery of money hereafter paid by the United States in respect of the transaction or matter which constitutes the subject matter of such case, unless and until such person shall assert therein a claim, or an interest in a claim, against the United States, and the United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate, as between any and all adverse claimants, their respective several interests in any matter in suit and to award several judgments in accordance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims shall not be affected by this chapter except to the extent necessary to give effect to this chapter, and no person shall recover judgment on any claim, or on any interest in any claim, in said court which such person would not have had a right to assert in said court if this section had not been enacted.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Review of terminated settlements; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any other provision of law notwithstanding, the function of the General Accounting Office with respect to any termination settlement made, authorized, ratified, or approved by a contracting agency shall be confined to determining, after final settlement, (1) whether the settlement payments to the war contractor were made in accordance with the settlement, and (2) whether the records transmitted to it, or other information, warrant a reasonable belief that the settlement was induced by fraud. For this purpose the General Accounting Office shall have the authority to examine any records maintained by any contracting agency or by any war contractor relating to any termination settlement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of fraudulent settlements to Department of Justice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Comptroller General is convinced that any settlement was induced by fraud, he shall so certify, together with all the facts relating thereto, to the Department of Justice, to the Administrator of General Services, and to the contracting agency concerned. Upon receipt of such certificate (1) the Department of Justice shall make an investigation to determine whether such settlement was induced by fraud, and (2) until the Department of Justice notifies the contracting agency that in its opinion the facts do not support the belief that the settlement was induced by fraud, the contracting agency, by set-off or otherwise, may withhold, from amounts owing to the war contractor by the United States under such settlement or otherwise, the amount of the settlement, or the portion thereof, which, in the opinion of the Comptroller General as stated in his certificate, was affected by the fraud. In any such case the Department of Justice shall take such action as it deems appropriate to recover payments made to such war contractor. The General Accounting Office shall not suspend credit to any disbursing officer on any disbursements made by him under such settlement in the absence of fraud on his part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller General may investigate the settlements completed by each contracting agency for the purpose of reporting to the Congress from time to time on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether the settlement methods and procedures employed by such agency are of a kind and type designed to result in expeditious and fair settlements in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter and the orders and regulations of the Administrator of General Services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether such methods and procedures are followed by such agency with care and efficiency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether such methods and procedures adequately protect the interest of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">If in any such report the Comptroller General shall find that the settlement methods and procedures fail to meet the foregoing standards, he shall make suggestions and recommendations to such agency for the improvement of such methods and procedures and to the Congress for any additional legislation needed to carry out the policies of this chapter. At least thirty days before filing any such report with the Congress, the Comptroller General shall deliver a copy thereof to the agency concerned and the Administrator of General Services, and shall forward to the Congress together with such report any comments of such agency with respect thereto.</p>

This subsection shall not limit or affect in any way any authority of any contracting agency under the First War Powers Act, 1941, or under any other statute.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Evidence required; conclusiveness of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contracting agency may prescribe the amount and kind of evidence required to iden<!-- PDFPage:50 -->tify any person as a war contractor, or any contract, agreement, or purchase order as a war contract for any of the purposes of this chapter. Any determination so made that any person is a war contractor, or that any contract, agreement, or purchase order is a war contract, shall be final and conclusive for any of the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for administering the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Impairment of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impair or modify any war contract or any term or provision of any war contract or any assignment of any claim under a war contract, without the consent of the parties thereto, if the war contract, or the term, provision, or assignment thereof, is otherwise valid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aid to war contractors</h4>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. It is the policy of Congress to provide relief to small business concerns which have fixed-price Government contracts in cases where such concerns have suffered or can be expected to suffer serious financial loss because of significant and unavoidable difficulties during performance because of the energy crisis or rapid and unexpected escalations of contract costs.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the conditions which have caused or are causing such cost increases were, or are being, experienced generally by other small business concerns in the market at the same time and are not caused by negligence, underbidding, or other special management factors peculiar to that small business concern.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procurement through full and open competition; competitive procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (g) of this section and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise expressly authorized by statute, an executive agency in conducting a procurement for property or services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures in <!-- PDFPage:60 -->accordance with the requirements of this title and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of competitive procedures that is best suited under the circumstances of the procurement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the competitive procedures appropriate under the circumstance, an executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall solicit sealed bids if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation of sealed bids;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the responding sources about their bids; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) there is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one sealed bid; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not appropriate under clause (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of particular source; restriction of solicitation to small business concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain any alternative source or sources of supply for that property or service if the agency head determines that to do so&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any anticipated procurement, of such property or services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the property or service in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would be in the interest of national defense in establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable source of supply of such property or service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the property or service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such supplies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of property or services covered by this section using competitive procedures, but excluding other than small business concerns in furtherance of sections 638 and 644 of title 15;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be subject to the justification and approval required by subsection (f)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a class of purchases or contracts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of noncompetitive procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures only when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center, or (C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or agency, or in any part of an alternative dispute resolution process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States Government and a foreign government or international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for such government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (h) of this section, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another executive agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the disclosure of the executive agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the head of the executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Property or services deemed available from only one source; nondelegable authority</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) use advance procurement planning and market research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) develop specifications in such manner as is necessary to obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of the property or services to be acquired.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the type of specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature of the needs of the executive agency and the market available to satisfy such needs. Subject to such needs, specifications may be stated in terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) function, so that a variety of products or services may qualify;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) performance, including specifications of the range of acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable standards; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a statement of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all significant factors and significant subfactors which the executive agency reasonably expects to consider in evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors and subfactors; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the time and place for submission of proposals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Evaluation factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each solicitation for competitive proposals, an executive agency&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) significantly less important than cost or price.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations implementing subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) may not define the terms &ldquo;significantly more important&rdquo; and &ldquo;significantly less important&rdquo; as specific numeric weights that would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of solicitations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional information in solicitation</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency shall evaluate sealed bids and competitive proposals, and award a contract, based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rejection of bids or proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All sealed bids or competitive proposals received in response to a solicitation may be rejected if the agency head determines that such action is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Opening of bids; promptness of award; written notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Sealed bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the solicitation. The executive agency shall evaluate the bids in accordance with subsection (a) of this section without discussions with the bidders and, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose bid conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the United States, considering only price and the other price-related factors included in the solicitation. The award of a contract shall be made by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to the successful bidder. Within 3 days after the date of contract award, the executive agency shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, <!-- PDFPage:65 -->each bidder not awarded the contract that the contract has been awarded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Discussions with offerors; written notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An executive agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in accordance with subsection (a) of this section and may award a contract&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) based on the proposals received and without discussions with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of minor clarification), if, as required by section 253a(b)(2)(B)(i) of this title, the solicitation included a statement that proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, the executive agency shall award a contract with reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose proposal is most advantageous to the United States, considering only cost or price and the other factors included in the solicitation. The executive agency shall award the contract by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to such source and, within 3 days after the date of contract award, shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, all other offerors of the rejection of their proposals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Post-award debriefings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When a contract is awarded by the head of an executive agency on the basis of competitive proposals, an unsuccessful offeror, upon written request received by the agency within 3 days after the date on which the unsuccessful offeror receives the notification of the contract award, shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract award. The executive agency shall debrief the offeror within, to the maximum extent practicable, 5 days after receipt of the request by the executive agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The debriefing shall include, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the executive agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the offeror's offer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the contractor awarded the contract and the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the debriefed offeror;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a summary of the rationale for the award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in the case of a proposal that includes a commercial item that is an end item under the contract, the make and model of the item being provided in accordance with the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the executive agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The debriefing may not include point-by-point comparisons of the debriefed offeror's offer with other offers and may not disclose any information that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each solicitation for competitive proposals shall include a statement that information described in paragraph (2) may be disclosed in post-award debriefings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, within one year after the date of the contract award and as a result of a successful procurement protest, the executive agency seeks to fulfill the requirement under the protested contract either on the basis of a new solicitation of offers or on the basis of new best and final offers requested for that contract, the head of such executive agency shall make available to all offerors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the information provided in debriefings under this subsection regarding the offer of the contractor awarded the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the same information that would have been provided to the original offerors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The contracting officer shall include a summary of the debriefing in the contract file.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Planning for future competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In preparing a solicitation for the award of a development contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a development contract are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which are currently available within the supply system of the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially available from more than one source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) With respect to items that are likely to be required in substantial quantities during the system's service life, proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items which the United States will be able to acquire competitively in the future.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In preparing a solicitation for the award of a production contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due consideration to the purposes for which the system is <!-- PDFPage:66 -->being procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to use such data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Protest file</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in the case of a solicitation for a contract issued by, or an award or proposed award of a contract by, the head of an executive agency, a protest is filed pursuant to the procedures in subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31, and an actual or prospective offeror so requests, a file of the protest shall be established by the procuring activity and reasonable access shall be provided to actual or prospective offerors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Information exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 may be redacted in a file established pursuant to paragraph (1) unless an applicable protective order provides otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations implementing this subsection shall be consistent with the regulations regarding the preparation and submission of an agency's protest file (the so-called &ldquo;rule 4 file&rdquo;) for protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals under section 759 of title 40.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Agency actions on protests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in connection with a protest, the head of an executive agency determines that a solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply with the requirements of law or regulation, the head of such executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may take any action set out in subparagraphs (A) through (F) of subsection (b)(1) of section 3554 of title 31; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may pay costs described in paragraph (1) of section 3554(c) of such title within the limits referred to in paragraph (2) of such section.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure effective and efficient expenditure of public funds and fair and expeditious resolution of protests to the award of Federal procurement contracts, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. Heads of executive departments and agencies (&ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) engaged in the procurement of supplies and services shall prescribe administrative procedures for the resolution of protests to the award of their procurement contracts as an alternative to protests in fora outside the procuring agencies. Procedures prescribed pursuant to this order shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) emphasize that whenever conduct of a procurement is contested, all parties should use their best efforts to resolve the matter with agency contracting officers;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) to the maximum extent practicable, provide for inexpensive, informal, procedurally simple, and expeditious resolution of protests, including, where appropriate and as permitted by law, the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques, third party neutrals, and another agency's personnel;</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) except where immediate contract award or performance is justified for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined to be in the best interest of the United States, prohibit award or performance of the contract while a timely filed protest is pending before the agency. To allow for the withholding of a contract award or performance, the agency must have received notice of the protest within either 10 calendar days after the contract award or 5 calendar days after the bidder or offeror who is protesting the contract award was given the opportunity to be debriefed by the agency, whichever date is later.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement. After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (b) of this section for up to two years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:68 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The waiver authority contained in paragraph (2) shall not apply with respect to any qualified products list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement, if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 637(b)(7) of title 15 if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement in order to comply with subsection (b) of this section or in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Number; qualified sources or products; fewer than two actual manufacturers; functions of agency head</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) periodically publish notice in the Commerce Business Daily soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise national security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the agency determines that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements) the costs incurred by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 632 of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Examination; need for qualification requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification requirement, the need for such qualification requirement shall be examined and the standards of such requirement revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section. The preceding sentence does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enforcement determination by agency head</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contracts; delivery of technical services; contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A contract for property or services entered into by an executive agency which provides for the delivery of technical data, shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall be prepared to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for any restriction asserted by the contractor or subcontractor on the right of the United States to use such technical data; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the contracting officer may review the validity of any restriction asserted by the contractor or by a subcontractor under the contract on the right of the United States to use technical data furnished to the United States under the contract if the contracting officer determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction and that the continued adherence to the asserted restriction by the United States would make it impracticable to procure the item competitively at a later time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review; challenge; notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If after such review the contracting officer determines that a challenge to the asserted restriction is warranted, the contracting officer shall provide written notice to the contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction. Such notice shall state&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the grounds for challenging the asserted restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the requirement for a response within 60 days justifying the current validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:69 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Written request; additional time; schedule of responses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a restriction subject to this section submits to the contracting officer a written request, showing the need for additional time to comply with the requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted restriction, additional time to adequately permit the submission of such justification shall be provided by the contracting officer as appropriate. If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers, shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Decision; validity of asserted restriction; failure to submit response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to submit any response under subsection (b) of this section, the contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a justification is submitted in response to the notice provided pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a contracting officer shall within 60 days of receipt of any justification submitted, issue a decision or notify the party asserting the restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Claim; considered claim within Contract Disputes Act of 1978</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier, such claim shall be considered a claim within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Challenge; use of technical data; sustained; liability of United States for costs and fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the United States to use such technical data is sustained&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the restriction on the right of the United States to use the technical data shall be cancelled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the United States for payment of the cost to the United States of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the United States in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the United States shall be liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the United States is found not to be made in good faith.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the requirements of this section, section 253j of this title, and other applicable law, the head of an executive agency may enter into a task order contract (as defined in section 253k of this title) for procurement of advisory and assistance services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive agency may enter into a task order contract for advisory and assistance services only under the authority of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on contract period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The period of a task order contract entered into under this section, including all periods of extensions of the contract under options, modifications, or otherwise, may not exceed five years unless a longer period is specifically authorized in a law that is applicable to such contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Content of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notice required by section 416 of this title and section 637(e) of title 15 shall reasonably and fairly describe the general scope, magnitude, and duration of the proposed task order contract in a manner that would reasonably enable a potential offeror to decide whether to request the solicitation and consider submitting an offer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Required content of solicitation and contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The solicitation shall include the information (regarding services) described in section 253h(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A task order contract entered into under this section shall contain the same information that is required by paragraph (1) to be included in the solicitation of offers for that contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Multiple awards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The head of an executive agency may, on the basis of one solicitation, award separate task order contracts under this section for the same or similar services to two or more sources if the solicitation states that the head of the executive agency has the option to do so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, in the case of a task order contract for advisory and assistance services to be entered into under the authority of this section, the contract period is to exceed three years and the contract amount is estimated to exceed $10,000,000 (including all options), the solicitation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide for a multiple award authorized under paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) include a statement that the head of the executive agency may also elect to award only one task order contract if the head of the executive agency determines in writing that only one of the offerers is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a solicitation for which the head of the executive agency concerned determines in writing that, because the services required under the contract are unique or highly specialized, it is not practicable to award more than one contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contract modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A task order may not increase the scope, period, or maximum value of the task order contract under which the order is issued. The scope, period, or maximum value of the contract may be increased only by modification of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unless use of procedures other than competitive procedures is authorized by an exception in subsection (c) of section 253 of this title and approved in accordance with subsection (f) <!-- PDFPage:72 -->of such section, competitive procedures shall be used for making such a modification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notice regarding the modification shall be provided in accordance with section 416 of this title and section 637(e) of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Contract extensions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the award of a follow-on contract has been delayed by circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the initial contract was entered into; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extension is necessary in order to ensure continuity of the receipt of services pending the award of, and commencement of performance under, the follow-on contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A task order contract may be extended under the authority of paragraph (1) only once and only in accordance with the limitations and requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Inapplicability to certain contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to a contract for the acquisition of property or services that includes acquisition of advisory and assistance services if the head of the executive agency entering into such contract determines that, under the contract, advisory and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a significant component of, the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Advisory and assistance services&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;advisory and assistance services&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 1105(g) of title 31.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Issuance of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following actions are not required for issuance of a task or delivery order under a task or delivery order contract:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a competition (or a waiver of competition approved in accordance with section 253(f) of this title) that is separate from that used for entering into the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Multiple award contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When multiple contracts are awarded under section 253h(d)(1)(B) or 253i(e) of this title, all contractors awarded such contracts shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered, pursuant to procedures set forth in the contracts, for each task or delivery order in excess of $2,500 that is to be issued under any of the contracts unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the executive agency's need for the services or property ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing such opportunity to all such contractors would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling that need;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) only one such contractor is capable of providing the services or property required at the level of quality required because the services or property ordered are unique or highly specialized;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already issued on a competitive basis; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is necessary to place the order with a particular contractor in order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statement of work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A task or delivery order shall include a statement of work that clearly specifies all tasks to be performed or property to be delivered under the order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Protests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Task and delivery order ombudsman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The head of each executive agency who awards multiple task or delivery order contracts pursuant to section 253h(d)(1)(B) or 253i(e) of this title shall appoint or designate a task and delivery order ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors on such contracts and ensuring that all of the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task or delivery orders when required under subsection (b) of this section.

Every contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a suitable warranty, as determined by the agency head, by the contractor that no person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure such contract upon an agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, excepting bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the contractor for the purpose of securing business, for the breach or violation of which warranty the Government shall have the right to annul such contract without liability or in its discretion to deduct from the contract price or consideration the full amount of such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Submission of cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section in the case of a contract, a subcontract, or a modification of a contract or subcontract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for which the price agreed upon is based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) adequate price competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) established catalog or market prices of commercial items that are sold in substantial quantities to the general public; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) prices set by law or regulation; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in an exceptional case when the head of the procuring activity, without delegation, determines that the requirements of this section may be waived and justifies in writing the reasons for such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Modifications of contracts and subcontracts for commercial items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a modification of a contract or subcontract for a commercial item that is not covered by the prohibition on the submission of cost or pricing data in paragraph (1)(A), submission of cost or pricing data shall not be required under subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the contract or subcontract being modified is a contract or subcontract for which submission of cost or pricing data <!-- PDFPage:76 -->may not be required by reason of paragraph (1)(A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the modification would not change the contract or subcontract, as the case may be, from a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a commercial item.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) FAR standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide clear standards for determining whether the exceptions provided in paragraph (1)(A) apply. In the case of the exception provided in paragraph (1)(A)(i), the regulations shall specify the criteria to be used to determine whether adequate price competition exists. In the case of the exception provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the regulations shall provide that the exception applies to items that are sold in substantial quantities to the general public, without regard to the quantity of items that may be sold to the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restrictions on additional authority to require cost or pricing data or other information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to require cost or pricing data on below-threshold contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), when cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted by subsection (a) of this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, such data may nevertheless be required to be submitted by the head of the procuring activity, but only if the head of the procuring activity determines that such data are necessary for the evaluation by the agency of the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract. In any case in which the head of the procuring activity requires such data to be submitted under this subsection, the head of the procuring activity shall justify in writing the reason for such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The head of the procuring activity may not require certified cost or pricing data to be submitted under this paragraph for any contract or subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, covered by the exceptions in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The head of a procuring activity may not delegate the functions under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority to require information other than certified cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract, the head of the procuring activity may require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional exception provisions regarding commercial items</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Procurements based on adequate price competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the maximum extent practicable, the head of an executive agency shall conduct procurements of commercial items on a competitive basis. In any procurement of a commercial item conducted on a competitive basis and based upon adequate price competition, the head of the executive agency conducting the procurement shall not require cost or pricing data to be submitted under subsection (a) of this section for the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract under the procurement. If additional information is necessary to determine the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract, the head of the executive agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, obtain the additional information from sources other than the offeror.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procurements not based on adequate price competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) In any case in which it is not practicable to conduct a procurement of a commercial item covered by subsection (a) of this section on a competitive basis, and the procurement is not covered by an exception in subsection (b) of this section, the contracting officer shall seek to obtain from the offeror or contractor information described in clause (ii). When such information is not available from that source, the contracting officer shall seek to obtain such information from another source or sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The information referred in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254b_1_target" name="254b_1">1</a></sup> clause (i) is information on prices at which the same item or similar items have been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating, through price analysis, the reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or modification of the contract or subcontract under the procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The contracting officer shall exempt a contract, subcontract, or modification of a contract or subcontract under the procurement from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section if the contracting officer obtains the information described in subparagraph (A)(ii) in accordance with standards and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A contracting officer may require submission of cost or pricing data under subsection (a) of this section only if the contracting officer makes a written determination that the agency is unable to obtain the information described in subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authority to audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In accordance with procedures prescribed in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the head of an executive agency is authorized to examine all information provided by an offeror, contractor, or subcontractor pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) and all books and records <!-- PDFPage:77 -->of such offeror, contractor, or subcontractor that directly relate to such information in order to determine whether the agency is receiving accurate information required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The right under subparagraph (A) shall expire 2 years after the date of award of the contract, or 2 years after the date of the modification of the contract, with respect to which the information was provided.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitations on requests for data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include reasonable limitations on requests under this subsection for sales data relating to commercial items.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Form of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In requesting information from an offeror under this subsection, a contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, limit the scope of the request to include only information that is in the form regularly maintained by the offeror in commercial operations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Confidentiality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any information received under this subsection that is exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of title 5 shall not be disclosed by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) of this section is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that such price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or pricing data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it shall be a defense that the United States did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the United States about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under such contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section before such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the United States before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable under paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties, the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Interest and penalties for certain overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor under a contract with an executive agency subject to this section and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for interest on the amount of such overpayment, to be computed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays <!-- PDFPage:78 -->the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 6621 of title 26; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the submission of such defective data was a knowing submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the overpayment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any liability under this subsection of a contractor that submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the certification required by subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the cost or pricing data shall not be affected by the refusal to submit such certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Right of United States to examine contractor records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and currency of cost or pricing data required to be submitted by this section, an executive agency shall have the authority provided by section 254d(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Required regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include regulations concerning the types of information that offerors must submit for a contracting officer to consider in determining whether the price of a procurement to the Government is fair and reasonable when certified cost or pricing data are not required to be submitted under this section because the price of the procurement to the United States is not expected to exceed the applicable threshold amount set forth in subsection (a) of this section (as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (7) of such subsection). Such information, at a minimum, shall include appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price of a proposed contract or subcontract for the procurement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Cost or pricing data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;cost or pricing data&rdquo; means all facts that, as of the date of agreement on the price of a contract (or the price of a contract modification) or, if applicable consistent with subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section, another date agreed upon between the parties, a prudent buyer or seller would reasonably expect to affect price negotiations significantly. Such term does not include information that is judgmental, but does include the factual information from which a judgment was derived.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Subcontract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;subcontract&rdquo; includes a transfer of commercial items between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or a subcontractor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Commercial item</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;commercial item&rdquo; has the meaning provided such term by section 403(12) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency may enter into a multiyear contract for the acquisition of property or services if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds are available and obligated for such contract, for the full period of the contract or for the first fiscal year in which the contract is in effect, and for the estimated costs associated with any necessary termination of such contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need for the property or services is reasonably firm and continuing over the period of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a multiyear contract will serve the best interests of the United States by encouraging full and open competition or promoting economy in administration, performance, and operation of the agency's programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Termination clause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A multiyear contract entered into under the authority of this section shall include a clause that provides that the contract shall be terminated if funds are not made available for the continuation of such contract in any fiscal year covered by the contract. Amounts available for paying termination costs shall remain available for such purpose until the costs associated with termination of the contract are paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cancellation ceiling notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before any contract described in subsection (a) of this section that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $10,000,000 may be awarded, the executive agency shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the Congress, and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Multiyear contract defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such appropriations are not made.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:79 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section is intended to modify or affect any other provision of law that authorizes multiyear contracts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a contractor performing a cost-reimbursement, incentive, time-and-materials, labor-hour, or price-redeterminable contract, or any combination of such contracts, made by that executive agency under this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a subcontractor performing any cost-reimbursement, incentive, time-and-materials, labor-hour, or price-redeterminable subcontract or any combination of such subcontracts under a contract referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive agency, acting through an authorized representative, is authorized, for the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and currency of certified cost or pricing data required to be submitted pursuant to section 254b&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254d_1_target" name="254d_1">1</a></sup> of this title with respect to a contract or subcontract, to examine all records of the contractor or subcontractor related to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the discussions conducted on the proposal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) pricing of the contract or subcontract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) performance of the contract or subcontract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subpoena power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Inspector General of an executive agency appointed under section 3 or 8G&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254d_1_target" name="254d_1">1</a></sup> of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) or, upon request of the head of an executive agency, the Director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency (or any successor agency) of the Department of Defense or the Inspector General of the General Services Administration may require by subpoena the production of records of a contractor, access to which is provided for that executive agency by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such subpoena, in the case of contumacy or refusal to obey, shall be enforceable by order of an appropriate United States district court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The authority provided by paragraph (1) may not be delegated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the year following a year in which authority provided in paragraph (1) is exercised for an executive agency, the head of the executive agency shall submit to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives a report on the exercise of such authority during such preceding year and the reasons why such authority was exercised in any instance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Comptroller General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), each contract awarded after using procedures other than sealed bid procedures shall provide that the Comptroller General and his representatives are authorized to examine any records of the contractor, or any of its subcontractors, that directly pertain to, and involve transactions relating to, the contract or subcontract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a contract or subcontract with a foreign contractor or foreign subcontractor if the executive agency concerned determines, with the concurrence of the Comptroller General or his designee, that the application of that paragraph to the contract or subcontract would not be in the public interest. However, the concurrence of the Comptroller General or his designee is not required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) where the contractor or subcontractor is a foreign government or agency thereof or is precluded by the laws of the country involved from making its records available for examination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where the executive agency determines, after taking into account the price and availability of the property and services from United States sources, that the public interest would be best served by not applying paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (1) may not be construed to require a contractor or subcontractor to create or maintain any record that the contractor or subcontractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to another provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on preaward audits relating to indirect costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency may not perform a preaward audit to evaluate proposed indirect costs under any contract, subcontract, or modification to be entered into in accordance with this subchapter in any case in which the contracting officer determines that the objectives of the audit can reasonably be met by accepting the results of an audit conducted by any other department or agency of the Federal Government within one year preceding the date of the contracting officer's determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority of an executive agency under subsection (a) of this section, and the authority of the Comptroller General under subsection (c) of this section, with respect to a contract or subcontract shall expire three years after final payment under such contract or subcontract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A contract or subcontract that is not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Form of original record storage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a contractor from duplicating or storing original records in electronic form.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Use of images of original records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An executive agency shall not require a contractor or subcontractor to provide original records in an audit carried out pursuant to this section if the contractor or subcontractor provides photographic or electronic images of the original records and meets the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The contractor or subcontractor has established procedures to ensure that the imaging process preserves the integrity, reliability, and security of the original records.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The contractor or subcontractor maintains an effective indexing system to permit timely and convenient access to the imaged records.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The contractor or subcontractor retains the original records for a minimum of one year after imaging to permit periodic validation of the imaging systems.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payment authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any executive agency may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make advance, partial, progress or other payments under contracts for property or services made by the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) insert in solicitations for procurement of property or services a provision limiting to small business concerns advance or progress payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Performance-based payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever practicable, payments under subsection (a) of this section shall be made on any of the following bases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Performance measured by objective, quantifiable methods such as delivery of acceptable items, work measurement, or statistical process controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Accomplishment of events defined in the program management plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Other quantifiable measures of results.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments made under subsection (a) of this section may not exceed the unpaid contract price.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Security for advance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Advance payments under subsection (a) of this section may be made only upon adequate security and a determination by the agency head that to do so would be in the public interest. Such security may be in the form of a lien in favor of the Government on the property contracted for, on the balance in an account in which such payments are deposited, and on such of the property acquired for performance of the contract as the parties may agree. This lien shall be paramount to all other liens and is effective immediately upon the first advancement of funds without filing, notice, or any other action by the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Conditions for progress payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The executive agency shall ensure that any payment for work in progress (including materials, labor, and other items) under a contract of an executive agency that provides for such payments is commensurate with the work accomplished that meets standards established under the contract. The contractor shall provide such information and evidence as the executive agency determines necessary to permit the executive agency to carry out the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The executive agency shall ensure that progress payments referred to in paragraph (1) are not made for more than 80 percent of the work accomplished under the contract so long as the executive agency has not made the contractual terms, specifications, and price definite.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection applies to any contract in an amount greater than $25,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Conditions for payments for commercial items</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payments under subsection (a) of this section for commercial items may be made under <!-- PDFPage:81 -->such terms and conditions as the head of the executive agency determines are appropriate or customary in the commercial marketplace and are in the best interests of the United States. The head of the executive agency shall obtain adequate security for such payments. If the security is in the form of a lien in favor of the United States, such lien is paramount to all other liens and is effective immediately upon the first payment, without filing, notice, or other action by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Advance payments made under subsection (a) of this section for commercial items may include payments, in a total amount of not more than 15 percent of the contract price, in advance of any performance of work under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The conditions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section need not be applied if they would be inconsistent, as determined by the head of the executive agency, with commercial terms and conditions pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Action in case of fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which the remedy coordination official of an executive agency finds that there is substantial evidence that the request of a contractor for advance, partial, or progress payment under a contract awarded by that executive agency is based on fraud, the remedy coordination official shall recommend that the executive agency reduce or suspend further payments to such contractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive agency receiving a recommendation under paragraph (1) in the case of a contractor's request for payment under a contract shall determine whether there is substantial evidence that the request is based on fraud. Upon making such a determination, the head of the executive agency may reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor under such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The extent of any reduction or suspension of payments by an executive agency under paragraph (2) on the basis of fraud shall be reasonably commensurate with the anticipated loss to the United States resulting from the fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A written justification for each decision of the head of an executive agency whether to reduce or suspend payments under paragraph (2), and for each recommendation received by the executive agency in connection with such decision, shall be prepared and be retained in the files of the executive agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The head of each executive agency shall prescribe procedures to ensure that, before the head of the executive agency decides to reduce or suspend payments in the case of a contractor under paragraph (2), the contractor is afforded notice of the proposed reduction or suspension and an opportunity to submit matters to the executive agency in response to such proposed reduction or suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Not later than 180 days after the date on which the head of an executive agency reduces or suspends payments to a contractor under paragraph (2), the remedy coordination official of the executive agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) review the determination of fraud on which the reduction or suspension is based; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) transmit a recommendation to the head of such executive agency whether the suspension or reduction should continue.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The head of each executive agency who receives recommendations made by a remedy coordination official of the executive agency to reduce or suspend payments under paragraph (2) during a fiscal year shall prepare for such year a report that contains the recommendations, the actions taken on the recommendations and the reasons for such actions, and an assessment of the effects of such actions on the Federal Government. Any such report shall be available to any Member of Congress upon request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The head of an executive agency may not delegate responsibilities under this subsection to any person in a position below level IV of the Executive Schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;remedy coordination official&rdquo;, with respect to an executive agency, means the person or entity in that executive agency who coordinates within that executive agency the administration of criminal, civil, administrative, and contractual remedies resulting from investigations of fraud or corruption related to procurement activities.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12969. Federal Acquisition and Community Right-To-Know</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12969, Aug. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 40989, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11001&ndash;11050) (&ldquo;EPCRA&rdquo;) and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101&ndash;13109) (&ldquo;PPA&rdquo;) established programs to protect public health and the environment by providing the public with important information on the toxic chemicals being released into the air, land, and water in their communities by manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Toxics Release Inventory (&ldquo;TRI&rdquo;) established pursuant to section 313(j) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(j), based on information required to be reported under section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of PPA, 42 U.S.C. 13106, provides the public, industry, and Federal, State, and local governments with a basic tool for making risk-based decisions about management and control of toxic chemicals, that can have significant adverse effects on human health and the environment. TRI data allow the public, industry, and government to gauge the progress of industry and government efforts to reduce toxic chemical wastes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sharing vital TRI information with the public has provided a strong incentive for reduction in the generation, and, ultimately, release into the environment, of toxic chemicals. Since the inception of the TRI pro<!-- PDFPage:101 -->gram, reported releases to the environment under TRI have decreased significantly.</p>
<p class="note-body">The efficiency of the Federal Government is served when it purchases high quality supplies and services that have been produced with a minimum impact on the public health and environment of communities surrounding government contractors. Savings associated with reduced raw materials usage, reduced use of costly, inefficient end-of-pipeline pollution controls, and reduced liability and remediation costs from worker and community claims all serve to increase the economic and efficient provision of essential supplies and services to the government. As a result of TRI reporting, many manufacturers have learned of previously unrecognized significant efficiencies and cost savings in their production processes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government's receipt of timely and quality supplies and services is also served by the general enhancement of relations between government contractors and the communities in which they are situated, as well as the cooperative working relationship between employers and employees who may be subject to exposure to toxic materials.</p>
<p class="note-body">Information concerning chemical release and transfer can assist the government to purchase efficiently produced, lower cost, and higher quality supplies and services that also have a minimum adverse impact on community health and the environment.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to promote economy and efficiency in government procurement of supplies and services, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq., PPA, 42 U.S.C. 13101 et seq., 40 U.S.C. 471 and 486(a), and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring supplies and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient procurement of Federal Government contracts, Federal agencies, to the greatest extent practicable, shall contract with companies that report in a public manner on toxic chemicals released to the environment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. 2&ndash;201. All definitions found in EPCRA and PPA and implementing regulations are incorporated into this order by reference, with the following exceptions for purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;202. &ldquo;<em>Federal agency</em>&rdquo; means an &ldquo;Executive agency,&rdquo; as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. For purposes of this order, military departments, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, are covered under the auspices of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;203. &ldquo;<em>Acquisition</em>&rdquo; means the acquiring by contract with appropriated funds of supplies or services (including construction) by and for the use of the Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the supplies or services are already in existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated. Acquisition begins at the point when the Federal department or agency needs are established and includes the description of requirements to satisfy agency needs, solicitation and selection of sources, award of contracts, contract financing, contract performance, contract administration, and those technical and management functions directly related to the process of fulfilling agency needs by contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;204. &ldquo;<em>Toxic chemical</em>&rdquo; means a substance on the list described in section 313(c) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(c), as it exists on the effective date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;205. &ldquo;<em>Administrator</em>&rdquo; means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&ldquo;EPA&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;206. &ldquo;<em>Federal contractor</em>&rdquo; means an entity that has submitted the successful bid or proposal in response to a competitive acquisition solicitation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Applicability</em>. 3&ndash;301. Each Federal agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include in contract solicitations as an eligibility criterion for the award of competitive acquisition contracts expected to equal or exceed $100,000 with the Federal contractors described in subsection 3&ndash;302, the requirement that such contractors must file (and continue to file for the life of the contract) a Toxic Chemical Release Form (&ldquo;Form R&rdquo;), as described in sections 313(a) and (g) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(a) and (g), for each toxic chemical manufactured, processed, or otherwise used by the Federal contractor at a facility, as described in section 313 of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023, and section 6607 of PPA, 42 U.S.C. 13106.</p>
<p class="note-body">3&ndash;302.

<p class="note-body">3&ndash;303. Each Federal agency shall find that a prospective Federal contractor has satisfied the requirement in subsection 3&ndash;301 if the contractor certifies in a solicitation that it:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(a) Does not manufacture, process, or otherwise use any toxic chemicals listed under section 313(c) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(c);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(b) Does not have 10 or more full-time employees as specified in section 313(b)(1)(A) of EPCRA, 42 U.S.C. 11023(b)(1)(A);</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58 F.R. 58095, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity. Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness. The electronic exchange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>1. </strong><strong>OBJECTIVES.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) exchange procurement information&mdash;such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents&mdash;electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>2. IMPLEMENTATION.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department or agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) assist the President's Management Council in implementing the electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules established herein; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President's Management Council and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each respective department or agency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>3. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Implementing regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Board shall promulgate rules and regulations for the implementation of cost accounting standards promulgated or interpreted under subsection (f) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) agree to a contract price adjustment, with interest, for any increased costs paid to such contractor or subcontractor by the United States by reason of a change in the contractor's or subcontractor's cost accounting practices or by reason of a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to comply with applicable cost accounting standards.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the United States and a contractor or subcontractor fail to agree on a contract price adjustment, including whether the contractor or subcontractor has complied with the applicable cost accounting standards, the disagreement will constitute a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act [41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any contract price adjustment undertaken pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) shall be made, where applicable, on relevant contracts between the United States and the contractor that are subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the United States from payment, in the aggregate, of increased costs (as defined by the Board). In no case shall the Government recover costs greater than the increased cost (as defined by the Board) to the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless the contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of the price negotiation and which it failed to disclose to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The interest rate applicable to any contract price adjustment shall be the annual rate of interest established under section 6621 of title 26 for such period. Such interest shall accrue from the time payments of the increased costs were made to the contractor or subcontractor to the time the United States receives full compensation for the price adjustment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall report to the Congress not later than one year after November 17, 1988, and annually thereafter, with respect to the activities and operations of the Board under this section, together with such recommendations as it considers appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Existing cost accounting standards referred to in paragraph (1) shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same manner as if promulgated by the Board under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator, under the authority set forth in section 405 of this title, shall ensure that no regulation or proposed regulation of an executive agency is inconsistent with a cost accounting standard promulgated or amended under this section by rescinding or denying the promulgation of any such inconsistent regulation or proposed regulation and taking such other action authorized under section 405 of this title as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Costs which are the subject of cost accounting standards promulgated under this section shall not be subject to regulations that are established by another executive agency that differ from such standards with respect to the measurement, assignment, and allocation of such costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of determining whether a contractor or subcontractor has complied with cost accounting standards promulgated under this section and has followed consistently the contractor's or subcontractor's disclosed cost accounting practices, any authorized representative of the head of the agency concerned, of the offices of inspector general established pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, or of the Comptroller General of the United States shall have the right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or records of such contractor or subcontractor relating to compliance with such cost accounting standards.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;605. Decision by contracting officer</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contractor claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All claims by a contractor against the government relating to a contract shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision. All claims by the government against a contractor relating to a contract shall be the subject of a decision by the contracting officer. Each claim by a contractor against the government relating to a contract and each claim by the government against a contractor relating to a contract shall be submitted within 6 years after the accrual of the claim. The preceding sentence does not apply to a claim by the government against a contractor that is based on a claim by the contractor involving fraud. The contracting officer shall issue his decisions in writing, and shall mail or otherwise furnish a copy of the decision to the contractor. The decision shall state the reasons for the decision reached, and shall inform the contractor of his rights as provided in this chapter. Specific findings of fact are not required, but, if made, shall not be binding in any subsequent proceeding. The authority of this subsection shall not extend to a claim or dispute for penalties or for<!-- PDFPage:139 -->feitures prescribed by statute or regulation which another Federal agency is specifically authorized to administer, settle, or determine. This section shall not authorize any agency head to settle, compromise, pay, or otherwise adjust any claim involving fraud.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review; performance of contract pending appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The contracting officer's decision on the claim shall be final and conclusive and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, or Government agency, unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced as authorized by this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit executive agencies from including a clause in government contracts requiring that pending final decision of an appeal, action, or final settlement, a contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of the contract in accordance with the contracting officer's decision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of claim; certification; notification; time of issuance; presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A contracting officer shall issue a decision on any submitted claim of $100,000 or less within sixty days from his receipt of a written request from the contractor that a decision be rendered within that period. For claims of more than $100,000, the contractor shall certify that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of his knowledge and belief, that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the government is liable, and that the certifier is duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A contracting officer shall, within sixty days of receipt of a submitted certified claim over $100,000&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) issue a decision; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the contractor of the time within which a decision will be issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The decision of a contracting officer on submitted claims shall be issued within a reasonable time, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the agency, taking into account such factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of the information in support of the claim provided by the contractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A contractor may request the tribunal concerned to direct a contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the tribunal concerned, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any failure by the contracting officer to issue a decision on a contract claim within the period required will be deemed to be a decision by the contracting officer denying the claim and will authorize the commencement of the appeal or suit on the claim as otherwise provided in this chapter. However, in the event an appeal or suit is so commenced in the absence of a prior decision by the contracting officer, the tribunal concerned may, at its option, stay the proceedings to obtain a decision on the claim by the contracting officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The contracting officer shall have no obligation to render a final decision on any claim of more than $100,000 that is not certified in accordance with paragraph (1) if, within 60 days after receipt of the claim, the contracting officer notifies the contractor in writing of the reasons why any attempted certification was found to be defective. A defect in the certification of a claim shall not deprive a court or an agency board of contract appeals of jurisdiction over that claim. Prior to the entry of a final judgment by a court or a decision by an agency board of contract appeals, the court or agency board shall require a defective certification to be corrected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The certification required by paragraph (1) may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the contractor with respect to the claim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternative means of dispute resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a contractor and a contracting officer may use any alternative means of dispute resolution under subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5, or other mutually agreeable procedures, for resolving claims. In a case in which such alternative means of dispute resolution or other mutually agreeable procedures are used, the contractor shall certify that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, and that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the Government is liable. All provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5, shall apply to such alternative means of dispute resolution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Termination of authority to engage in alternative means of dispute resolution; savings provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority of agencies to engage in alternative means of dispute resolution proceedings under subsection (d) of this section shall cease to be effective on October 1, 1999, except that such authority shall continue in effect with respect to then pending dispute resolution proceedings which, in the judgment of the agencies that are parties to such proceedings, require such continuation, until such proceedings terminate. In any case in which the contracting officer rejects a contractor's request for alternative dispute resolution proceedings, the contracting officer shall provide the contractor with a written explanation, citing one or more of the conditions in section 572(b) of title 5 or such other specific reasons that alternative dispute resolution procedures are inappropriate for the resolution of the dispute. In any case in which a contractor rejects a request of an agency for alternative dispute resolution proceedings, the contractor shall inform the agency in writing of the contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the request.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment; consultation; Tennessee Valley Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) an agency board of contract appeals may be established within an executive agency when the agency head, after consultation with the Administrator, determines from a workload study that the volume of contract claims justifies the establishment of a full-time agency board of at least three members who shall have no other inconsistent duties. Workload studies will be updated at least once every three years and submitted to the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority may establish a board of contract appeals for the Authority of an indeterminate number of members.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of members; chairman; compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the members of agency boards shall be selected and appointed to serve in the same manner as administrative law judges appointed pursuant to section 3105 of title 5, with an additional requirement that such members shall have had not fewer than five years&rsquo; experience in public contract law. Full-time members of agency boards serving as such on the effective date of this chapter shall be considered qualified. The chairman and vice chairman of each board shall be designated by the agency head from members so appointed. Compensation for the chairman, the vice chairman, and all other members of an agency board shall be determined under section 5372a of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority shall establish criteria for the appointment of members to its agency board of contract appeals established in subsection (a)(2) of this section, and shall designate a chairman of such board. The chairman and all other members of such board shall receive compensation, at the daily equivalent of the rates determined under section 5372a of title 5, for each day they are engaged in the actual performance of their duties as members of the board.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:141 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appeals; inter-agency arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the volume of contract claims is not sufficient to justify an agency board under subsection (a) of this section or if he otherwise considers it appropriate, any agency head shall arrange for appeals from decisions by contracting officers of his agency to be decided by a board of contract appeals of another executive agency. In the event an agency head is unable to make such an arrangement with another agency, he shall submit the case to the Administrator for placement with an agency board. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each agency board shall have jurisdiction to decide any appeal from a decision of a contracting officer (1) relative to a contract made by its agency, and (2) relative to a contract made by any other agency when such agency or the Administrator has designated the agency board to decide the appeal. In exercising this jurisdiction, the agency board is authorized to grant any relief that would be available to a litigant asserting a contract claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An agency board shall provide to the fullest extent practicable, informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes, and shall issue a decision in writing or take other appropriate action on each appeal submitted, and shall mail or otherwise furnish a copy of the decision to the contractor and the contracting officer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Accelerated appeal disposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rules of each agency board shall include a procedure for the accelerated disposition of any appeal from a decision of a contracting officer where the amount in dispute is $100,000 or less. The accelerated procedure shall be applicable at the sole election of only the contractor. Appeals under the accelerated procedure shall be resolved, whenever possible, within one hundred and eighty days from the date the contractor elects to utilize such procedure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The decision of an agency board of contract appeals shall be final, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a contractor may appeal such a decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within one hundred twenty days after the date of receipt of a copy of such decision, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the agency head, if he determines that an appeal should be taken, and with the prior approval of the Attorney General, transmits the decision of the board of contract appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for judicial review under section 1295 of title 28, within one hundred and twenty days from the date of the agency's receipt of a copy of the board's decision.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the decision of the board of contract appeals of the Tennessee Valley Authority shall be final, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a contractor may appeal such a decision to a United States district court pursuant to the provisions of section 1337 of title 28, within one hundred twenty days after the date of receipt of a copy of such decision, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Tennessee Valley Authority may appeal the decision to a United States district court pursuant to the provisions of section 1337 of title 28, within one hundred twenty days after the date of the decision in any case.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An award by an arbitrator under this chapter shall be reviewed pursuant to sections 9 through 13 of title 9, except that the court may set aside or limit any award that is found to violate limitations imposed by Federal statute.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Procedural guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to the authority conferred under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act [41 U.S.C. 401 et seq.], the Administrator is authorized and directed, as may be necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this chapter, to issue guidelines with respect to criteria for the establishment, functions, and procedures of the agency boards (except for a board established by the Tennessee Valley Authority).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the performance of <!-- PDFPage:145 -->such contract be given a copy of the statement required by subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) notifying the employee in the statement required by subparagraph (A), that as a condition of employment on such contract, the employee will&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grounds for suspension, termination, or debarment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If a contracting officer determines, in writing, that cause for suspension of payments, termination, or suspension or debarment exists, an appropriate action shall be initiated by a contracting officer of the agency, to be conducted by the agency concerned in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable agency procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to include rules for conducting suspension and debarment proceedings under this subsection, including rules providing notice, opportunity to respond in writing or in person, and such other procedures as may be necessary to provide a full and fair proceeding to a contractor or individual in such proceeding.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of debarment</h4>
