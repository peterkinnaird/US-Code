<p class="statutory-body">(a) The United States Postal Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States, authorized by the Constitution, created by Act of Congress, and supported by the people. The Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people. It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal services to all communities. The costs of establishing and maintaining the Postal Service shall not be apportioned to impair the overall value of such service to the people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Postal Service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining. No small post office shall be closed solely for operating at a deficit, it being the specific intent of the Congress that effective postal services be insured to residents of both urban and rural communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) As an employer, the Postal Service shall achieve and maintain compensation for its officers and employees comparable to the rates and types of compensation paid in the private sector of the economy of the United States. It shall place particular emphasis upon opportunities for career advancements of all officers and employees and the achievement of worthwhile and satisfying careers in the service of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Postal rates shall be established to apportion the costs of all postal operations to all users of the mail on a fair and equitable basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In determining all policies for postal services, the Postal Service shall give the highest consideration to the requirement for the most expeditious collection, transportation, and delivery of important letter mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In selecting modes of transportation, the Postal Service shall give highest consideration to the prompt and economical delivery of all mail and shall make a fair and equitable distribution of mail business to carriers providing similar modes of transportation services to the Postal Service. Modern methods of transporting mail by containerization and programs designed to achieve overnight transportation to the destination of important letter mail to all parts of the Nation shall be a primary goal of postal operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In planning and building new postal facilities, the Postal Service shall emphasize the need for facilities and equipment designed to create desirable working conditions for its officers and employees, a maximum degree of convenience for efficient postal services, proper access to existing and future air and surface transportation facilities, and control of costs to the Postal Service.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Governors of the United States Postal Service</p>
<p class="note-body">I have been advised by the Department of Justice that the United States District Court for the District of Delaware held in <em>UPS Worldwide Forwarding v. United States Postal Service</em>, Civil Action No. 93&ndash;340, May 16, 1994 [853 F. Supp. 800], that the Postal Service must obtain the approval of the President to establish rates of postage or other charges on mail matter conveyed between the United States and other countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">On appeal of the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the Government argues that the explicit consent of the President is not required. In the view of the Government, to the extent that 39 U.S.C. 407(a) does require the President to consent, it does not require that consent be given in any particular manner. The Government's position is that the failure of the President to object to the establishment of international postage rates and other charges is consent to the establishment of such rates and other charges. This has been the practice of the Government for the past 120 years.</p>
<p class="note-body">To the extent that the District Court's decision creates or appears to create an obligation for the President to give his consent to the establishment of rates of postage and other charges on mail matter conveyed between the United States and other countries in a particular manner, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, I hereby delegate to the Governors of the United States Postal Service, as defined by section 202(a) of title 39 of the United States Code, any authority vested in me by section 407(a) of title 39 of the United States Code, with respect to the establishment of rates of postage and other charges on mail matter conveyed between the United States and other countries. This delegation is effective until the date on which the Third Circuit Court of Appeals issues its mandate in the aforementioned appeal. This delegation relates only to the establishment of rates of postage and other charges on mail matter conveyed between the United States and other countries; it does not affect the obligation of the Postal Service to seek the consent of the President to negotiate and conclude postal treaties or conventions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Postal Service and the supervisors&rsquo; organization shall strive to resolve any differences concerning the proposal described in paragraph (1) of this subsection under the procedures provided for, or adopted under, subsection (d) of this section.</p>

Each such committee shall take such action as it considers appropriate and shall advise the Postal Service of such action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The failure of the President to request the appropriation of any part of the funds authorized by this section may not be deemed a failure of appropriations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The rates established under chapter 36 of this title for zone-rated parcels formerly entered under former chapter 67 of this title shall not be more than 10 percent less than the rates for such mail would be if the funds authorized under subsection (b) were not appropriated.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Whenever the Postal Service believes that any person is mailing or causing to be mailed any sexually oriented advertisement in violation of section 3010 of this title, it may request the Attorney General to commence a civil action against such person in a district court of the United States. Upon a finding by the court of a violation of that section, the court may issue an order including one or more of the following provisions as the court deems just under the circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a direction to the defendant to refrain from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to a specific addressee, to any group of addressees, or to all persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a direction to any postmaster to whom sexually oriented advertisements originating with such defendant are tendered for transmission through the mails to refuse to accept such advertisements for mailing; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a direction to any postmaster at the office at which registered or certified letters or other letters or mail arrive, addressed to the defendant or his representative, to return the registered or certified letters or other letters or mail to the sender appropriately marked as being in response to mail in violation of section 3010 of this title, after the defendant, or his representative, has been notified and given reasonable opportunity to examine such letters or mail and to obtain delivery of mail which is clearly not connected with activity alleged to be in violation of section 3010 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The statement that remittances may be made to a person named in a sexually oriented advertisement is prima facie evidence that such named person is the principal, agent, or representative of the mailer for the receipt of remittances on his behalf. The court is not precluded from ascertaining the existence of the agency on the basis of any other evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In preparation for, or during the pendency of, a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, a district court of the United States, upon application therefor by the Attorney General and upon a showing of probable cause to believe the statute is being violated, may enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction containing such terms as the court deems just, including, but not limited to, provisions enjoining the defendant from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to any person or class of persons, directing any postmaster to refuse to accept such defendant's sexually oriented advertisements for mailing, and directing the detention of the defendant's incoming mail by any postmaster pending the conclusion of the judicial proceedings. Any action taken by a court under this subsection does not affect or determine any fact at issue in any other proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A civil action under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in any judicial district in which any sexually oriented advertisement mailed in violation of section 3010 has been delivered by mail according to the direction thereon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Nothing in this section or in section 3010 shall be construed as amending, preempting, limiting, modifying, or otherwise in any way affecting section 1461 or 1463 of title 18 or section 3006, 3007, or 3008 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5402. Contracts for transportation of mail by air</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Postal Service may contract with any certificated air carrier, without advertising for bids, in such manner and under such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, for the transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the points in foreign air transportation between which the carrier is authorized by the Secretary of Transportation to engage in the transportation of mail. Such contracts shall be for the transportation of at least 750 pounds of mail per flight, and no more than 5 percent, based on weight, of the international mail transported under any such contract shall consist of letter mail. Any such contract shall be filed with the Secretary of Transportation not later than 90 days before its effective date. Unless the Secretary of Transportation shall determine otherwise (under criteria prescribed by section 40101(a) of title 49) not later than 10 days prior to the effective date of the contract, such contract shall become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the Postal Service deems that the transportation of mail by aircraft is required between points in foreign air transportation between which the Secretary of Transportation has not authorized an air carrier or combination of air carriers to engage in the transportation of mail, it may contract with any air carrier in such manner and under such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate for the transportation of any class or classes of mail. The transportation of mail under contracts entered into under this subsection is not, except for sections 40109(a) and (c)&ndash;(h) and 42112 of title 49, air transportation within the provisions of part A of subtitle VII of title 49. The Postal Service shall cancel such contract, in whole or in respect to certain points as the certificate shall require, upon the issuance by the Secretary of Transportation of an authorization under chapters 411 and 413 of title 49 to any air carrier to engage in the transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the points named in the contract, and the inauguration of scheduled service by such carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If the Postal Service determines that service by certificated air carriers or combination of air carriers between any pair or pairs of points in foreign air transportation is not adequate for its purposes, it may contract for a period of not more than 4 years, without advertising for bids, in such manner and under such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, with any air taxi operator or combination thereof for such air transportation service. Contracts made under this subsection may be renewed at the existing rate by mutual agreement between the holder and the Postal Service. The Postal Service, with the consent of the air taxi operator, may adjust the compensation under such contracts for increased or decreased costs occasioned by changed conditions occurring during the contract term. The Postal Service shall cancel such a contract when the Secretary of Transportation authorizes an additional certificated carrier or carriers to provide service between any pair or pairs of points covered by the contract, and such carrier or carriers inaugurate schedules adequate for its purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Postal Service may determine rates and contract with any air carrier for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate air transportation either through negotiations or competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of this section, the terms &ldquo;air carrier&rdquo;, &ldquo;interstate air transportation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;foreign air transportation&rdquo; have the meanings given such terms in section 40102(a) of title 49.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) During the period beginning January 1, 1985, and ending January 1, 1999, the authority of the Secretary of Transportation and the Postal Service under subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall also apply, and the authority of the Postal Service under subsection (d) shall not apply, to the transportation of mail by aircraft between any two points both of which are within the State of Alaska and between which the air carrier is authorized by the Secretary to engage in the transportation of mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Postal Service, in selecting carriers of non-priority bypass mail to any point served by more than one carrier in the State of Alaska, shall, at a minimum, require that any such carrier shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under section 41102(a) of title 49;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) operate at least 3 scheduled flights each week to such point;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) exhibit an adherence to such scheduled flights to the best of the abilities of such carrier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) have provided scheduled service within the State of Alaska for at least 12 months before being selected as a carrier of non-priority bypass mail.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:83 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The Postal Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may provide direct mainline non-priority bypass mail service to any bush point in the State of Alaska, without regard to paragraph (1)(B), if such service is equal to or better than interline service in cost and quality; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall deduct the non-priority bypass mail poundage flown on direct mainline flights to bush points within the State of Alaska by any carrier, from such carrier's allocation of the total poundage of non-priority bypass mail transported to the nearest appropriate Postal Service hub point in any month.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Postal Service shall determine the bypass mail bush points and hub points described under paragraph (2)(B) after consultation with the State of Alaska and the affected local communities and air carriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any changes in the determinations of the Postal Service under subparagraph (A) shall be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) after consultation with the State of Alaska and the affected local communities and air carriers; and</p>
