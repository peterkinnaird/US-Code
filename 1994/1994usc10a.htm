<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) With the Senior Judge's consent, and at the request of the Chief Judge, a Senior Judge may perform judicial duties with the Court if an active Judge of the Court is disabled or has recused himself or if there is a vacancy in an active judgeship on the Court. For the periods of time when performing judicial duties with the Court, a Senior Judge shall receive the same pay, per diem, and travel allowances as an active Judge; and the receipt of pay shall be in lieu of receipt of retired pay or annuity with respect to these same periods. The periods of performance of judicial duties by a Senior Judge shall be certified by the Chief Judge and recorded by the Clerk of Court. The Clerk of Court shall notify the appropriate official to make timely payments of pay and allowances with respect to periods of time when a Senior Judge is performing judicial duties with the Court and shall notify the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund to make appropriate adjustments in the Senior Judge's retired pay or annuity. <em>See</em> Article 142(e)(2), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 USC &sect;942(e)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In addition to the performance of judicial duties with the Court, a Senior Judge may, at the request of the Chief Judge and with the Senior Judge's consent, perform such other duties as the Chief Judge may request or the Court may direct. Such other duties may include, but are not limited to, service as a special master or as an adviser on Court operations, administration, and rules; representation of the Court at conferences, seminars, committee meetings or other official or professional functions; coordination of or assistance with conferences being conducted by the Court; and assistance in the compilation of history or archives of the Court. A Senior Judge shall not receive pay for the performance of such other duties with the Court but may be paid per diem and travel allowance to reimburse expenses incurred by the Senior Judge while performing such duties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whether in the performance of judicial duties or other duties, a Senior Judge shall be provided such administrative and secretarial assistance, office space, and access to the Courthouse, other public buildings, court files, and related information, as the Chief Judge considers appropriate for the performance of those duties by the Senior Judge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The title of Senior Judge may not be used in any way for personal gain or in connection with any business activity, advertisement, or solicitation of funds. However, the title of a Senior Judge may be referred to in any professional biography or listing and may be used in connection with any judicial or other duties that the Chief Judge requests the Senior Judge to perform.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No Senior Judge of the Court may engage in the practice of law in connection with any matter that involves an investigation or trial for any matter arising under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or appellate review of any court-martial proceeding by a Court of Criminal Appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) These rules shall apply to &ldquo;senior judges&rdquo; as defined by Article 142(e)(1), UCMJ, 10 USC 942(e)(1) and are promulgated pursuant to Article 142(e)(5), UCMJ, 10 USC &sect;942(e)(5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Model Rules of Professional Conduct of the American Bar Association are hereby adopted as the rules of conduct for members of the Bar of this Court. After notice, investigation, and hearing as provided in this rule, the Court may take any disciplinary action it deems appropriate for failure to comply with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For purposes of this rule, the Court shall appoint an Investigations Committee consisting of five members of the Bar of this Court who shall be appointed for a period of three years. The Investigations Committee shall consider such complaints as may be referred to it for investigation, including the taking of evidence, and shall submit a report of such investigation to the Court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Upon receipt and docketing of a written complaint under oath of unprofessional conduct against a member of its Bar, the Court will cause a copy thereof to be served by certified mail, return receipt requested, on the attorney thus accused. The Clerk will, in addition, acknowledge by letter, to the person filing such complaint, the receipt thereof. The accused attorney will answer the complaint by filing a formal pleading responsive to each allegation of misconduct within 30 days of receipt of the complaint, but extensions of time may be granted by order of the Court on the accused attorney's application. A complaint will be docketed only if the Court makes a preliminary determination that it is not frivolous.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) On consideration of the complaint and answer, and if it believes a substantial basis exists for the complaint, the Court will refer the matter to its Investigations Committee for consideration under subsection (b). Otherwise, the Court will dismiss the complaint. Any such investigation will be held privately, unless the accused attorney requests that it be opened to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) On receiving the report of the Investigations Committee, the Court may dismiss the complaint or order the matter set down for hearing, giving due notice to the accused attorney. At the hearing, the accused attorney will be given opportunity to present such matters relevant to the complaint as he or she deems appropriate and to examine any witnesses against such attorney. All documents received in connection with a complaint under this rule shall be furnished to the accused attorney. A majority vote of the Court is necessary to find an attorney guilty of unprofessional conduct and to fix any penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) When it is shown to the Court that any member of its Bar has been disbarred or suspended from practice by any court, such member will be forthwith called upon to show cause within 30 days why similar action should not be taken by this Court. Upon the filing of the member's answer to an order to show cause, or upon the expiration of 30 days if no answer is filed, the Court will enter an appropriate order; but no order of disbarment or suspension will be entered except with the concurrence of a majority of the judges participating.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Penalties for unprofessional conduct may extend to reprimand, suspension, or disbarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Except for an order of reprimand, suspension or disbarment, no papers, pleadings or other information relative to a complaint in a disciplinary proceeding will be published or released to the public without prior approval of the Court. The docket of matters arising under this rule shall not be available to the public.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <em>General</em>. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, order of the Court, or any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, nor a holiday. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, will be excluded in the computation. When a period of time is computed under these rules from the date of the decision of a Court of Criminal Appeals, such time is to be computed from the date of such decision unless a petition <!-- PDFPage:15 -->for reconsideration is timely filed, in which event the period of time is to be computed from the date of final action on the petition for reconsideration.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <em>Additional time when service by mail</em>. Whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act within a prescribed period after the issuance of an order or the filing of a notice, pleading, or other paper relative to a case when service thereof is made upon him by mail, 5 days will be added to the prescribed period if the party upon whom the service is made is within the limits of the contiguous 48 States and the District of Columbia, and 15 days will be added if the party is located outside these limits, including the States of Alaska and Hawaii. This provision for additional time shall not apply, however, to the time limitations prescribed in Rule 19(a)(1) for the filing of a petition for grant of review.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A majority of the judges present for duty may order that any appeal or other proceeding be considered or reconsidered, except as indicated in section (c) below, by the Court sitting as a whole. Such consideration or reconsideration ordinarily will not be ordered except (1) when consideration by the full Court is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of decision, or (2) when the proceedings involve a question of exceptional importance, or (3) when a sentence being reviewed pursuant to Article 66 extends to death.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A party may suggest the appropriateness of consideration or reconsideration by the Court as a whole. If a party desires to suggest in cases being reviewed pursuant to Article 66, that a matter be considered initially by the Court as a whole, the suggestion must be filed with the Court within 5 days after the government files its answer to the assignment of errors, or the accused files a reply if permitted to do so under Rule 15(b). In other proceedings the suggestion must be filed with the party's initial petition or other initial pleading, or within 5 days after the response thereto is filed. A suggestion for reconsideration by the Court as a whole must be made within the time prescribed by Rule 19 for filing a motion for reconsideration. No response to the suggestion may be filed unless the Court shall so order.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The suggestion of a party for consideration or reconsideration by the Court as a whole shall <!-- PDFPage:20 -->be transmitted to each judge of the Court who is present for duty, but a vote need not be taken to determine whether the cause shall be considered or reconsidered by the Court as a whole unless a judge requests a vote on such a suggestion made by a party. En banc reconsideration of an en banc decision will not be held unless one member of the original majority concurs in a vote for reconsideration.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">SPECIFICATION 1 OF CHARGE I FAILS TO STATE AN OFFENSE UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The allegation of absence in Specification 1 of Charge I fails to indicate that the absence was &ldquo;without proper authority.&rdquo; The United States Court of Military Appeals has held that such an omission is fatal to the legal sufficiency of the specification. <em>United States v. Schultz,</em> 16 U.S.C.M.A. 488, 37 C.M.R. 108 (1967); <em>United States v. Fout,</em> 3 U.S.C.M.A. 565, 13 C.M.R. 121 (1953).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">WHEREFORE, the findings as to Specification 1 of Charge I should be set aside and the sentence reassessed on the basis of the remaining charges and specifications.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">THE MILITARY JUDGE FAILED TO TAILOR HIS INSTRUCTIONS ON SENTENCE TO THE <!-- PDFPage:23 -->MATTERS PRESENTED IN MITIGATION AND EXTENUATION</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">There was extensive evidence presented on behalf of accused to establish his proper exemplary conduct in civilian and military life. (R. 108&ndash;133). The military judge limited his instructions on sentence to the maximum authorized punishment and the voting procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In <em>United States v. Wheeler,</em> 17 U.S.C.M.A. 274, 38 C.M.R. 72 (1967), the failure of the military judge to tailor the instructions on sentence to the evidence presented in mitigation and extenuation was held to require a rehearing on sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">WHEREFORE, the sentence should be set aside and a rehearing authorized thereon.</p>
<h3 class="italic-head">Sentence Appropriateness</h3>
<p class="statutory-body">Accused is an 18-year old first time offender (Post-trial Review, p. 3) and has sincerely urged his restoration to duty. (R. 100). His immediate superiors have expressed their willingness to have accused return to his organization. (R. 110).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">WHEREFORE, only so much of the sentence as provides for forfeiture of $50.00 pay per month for 6 months, confinement at hard labor for 6 months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade should be approved by this Honorable Court.</p>
