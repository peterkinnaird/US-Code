<h4 class="note-head">Deterring Illegal Immigration</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 7, 1995, 60 F.R. 7885, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">It is a fundamental right and duty for a nation to protect the integrity of its borders and its laws. This Administration shall stand firm against illegal immigration and the continued abuse of our immigration laws. By closing the back door to illegal immigration, we will continue to open the front door to legal immigrants.</p>
<p class="note-body">My Administration has moved swiftly to reverse the course of a decade of failed immigration policies. Our initiatives have included increasing overall Border personnel by over 50 percent since 1993. We also are strengthening worksite enforcement and work authorization verification to deter employment of illegal aliens. Asylum rules have been reformed to end abuse by those falsely claiming asylum, while offering protection to those in genuine fear of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens and reforming criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And we are the first Administration to obtain funding to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">While we already are doing more to stem the flow of illegal immigration than has any previous Administration, more remains to be done. In conjunction with the Administration's unprecedented budget proposal to support immigration initiatives, this directive provides a blueprint of policies and priorities for this Administration's continuing work to curtail illegal immigration. With its focus on strong border deterrence backed up by effective worksite enforcement, removal of criminal and other deportable aliens and assistance to states, this program protects the security of our borders, our jobs and our communities for all Americans&mdash;citizens and legal immigrants alike.</p>

<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">COMPREHENSIVE BORDER CONTROL STRATEGY</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">A. <em>Deterring Illegal Immigration At Our Borders</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">I have directed the Attorney General to move expeditiously toward full implementation of our comprehensive border control strategy, including efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained long-term strengthening of our deterrence capacity, the Administration shall seek funding to add new Border Patrol agents to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting our borders by the year 2000.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Flexible Border Response Capacity</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">To further this strategy, the Department of Justice shall implement the capacity to respond to emerging situations anywhere along our national borders to deter buildups of illegal border crossers, smuggling operations, or other developing problems.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Strategic Use of High Technology</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes, helicopters, light planes, all-terrain vehicles, fingerprinting and automated recordkeeping, we have freed many Border Patrol agents from long hours of bureaucratic tasks and increased the effectiveness of these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools are essential for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job, I direct the Attorney General to accelerate to the greatest extent possible their utilization and enhancement to support implementation of our deterrence strategy.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Strong Enforcement Against Repeat Illegal Crossers</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of efforts underway to deter repeat illegal crossers, such as fingerprinting and dedicating prosecution resources to enforce the new prosecution authority provided by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, see Tables for classification].</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Justice shall determine whether accelerated expansion of these techniques to additional border sectors is warranted.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">B. <em>Deterring Alien Smuggling</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">This Administration has had success deterring large ship-based smuggling directly to United States shores. In response, smugglers are testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success in choking off these attempts by adjusting our anti-smuggling initiatives to anticipate shifting smuggling patterns.</p>
<p class="note-body">To meet new and continuing challenges posed along transport routes and in foreign locations by smuggling organizations, we will augment diplomatic and enforcement resources at overseas locations to work with host governments, and increase related intelligence gathering efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other relevant agencies, will report to the National Security Council within 30 days on the structure of interagency coordination to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="note-body">Congressional action will be important to provide U.S. law enforcement agencies with needed authority to deal with international smuggling operations. I will propose that the Congress pass legislation providing wiretap authority for investigation of alien smuggling cases and providing authorization to seize the assets of groups engaged in trafficking in human cargo.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, I will propose legislation to give the Attorney General authority to implement procedures for expedited exclusion to deal with large flows of undocumented migrants, smuggling operations, and other extraordinary migration situations.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">C. <em>Visa Overstay Deterrence</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Nearly half of this country's illegal immigrants come into the country legally and then stay after they are required by law to depart, often using fraudulent documentation. No Administration has ever made a serious effort to identify and deport these individuals. This Administration is committed to curtailing this form of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, relevant departments and agencies are directed to review their policies and practices to identify necessary reforms to curtail visa overstayers and to enhance investigations and prosecution of those who fraudulently produce or misuse passports, visas, and other travel related documents. Recommendations for administrative initiatives and legislative reform shall be presented to the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration by June 30, 1995.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">REDUCING THE MAGNET OF WORK OPPORTUNITIES, WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT, AND DETERRENCE</h4>
<p class="note-body">Border deterrence cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the United States remains. Therefore, a second major component of the Administration's deterrence <!-- PDFPage:44 -->strategy is to toughen worksite enforcement and employer sanctions. Employers who hire illegal immigrants not only obtain unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding employers, their unlawful use of illegal immigrants suppresses wages and working conditions for our country's legal workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at employers and industries that historically have relied upon employment of illegal immigrants, will not only strengthen deterrence of illegal immigration, but better protect American workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="note-body">Central to this effort is an effective, nondiscriminatory means of verifying the employment authorization of all new employees. The Administration fully supports the recommendation of the Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test various techniques for improving workplace verification, including a computer database test to validate a new worker's social security number for work authorization purposes. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration are directed to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots and provide me with an interim report on the progress of this program by March 1, 1996.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, the INS is directed to finalize the Administration's reduction of the number of authorized documents to support work verification for noncitizens. Concurrently, the Administration will seek further reduction legislatively in the number of documents that are acceptable for proving identity and work authorization. The Administration will improve the security of existing documents to be used for work authorization and seek increased penalties for immigration fraud, including fraudulent production and use of documents.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Labor shall intensify its investigations in industries with patterns of labor law violations that promote illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="note-body">I also direct the Department of Labor, INS, and other relevant Federal agencies to expand their collaboration in cracking down on those who subvert fair competition by hiring illegal aliens. This may include increased Federal authority to confiscate assets that are the fruits of that unfair competition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall further examine the link between immigration and employment, including illegal immigration, and recommend to me other appropriate measures.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">DETENTION AND REMOVAL OF DEPORTABLE ILLEGAL ALIENS</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Administration's deterrence strategy includes strengthening the country's detention and deportation capability. No longer will criminals and other high risk deportable aliens be released back into communities because of a shortage of detention space and ineffective deportation procedures.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">A. <em>Comprehensive Deportation Process Reform</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Justice, in consultation with other relevant agencies, shall develop a streamlined, fair, and effective procedure to expedite removal of deportable aliens. As necessary, additional legislative authority will be sought in this area. In addition, the Department of Justice shall increase its capacity to staff deportation and exclusion hearings to support these objectives.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">B. <em>National Detention and Removal Plan</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">To address the shortage of local detention space for illegal aliens, the Administration shall devise a National Detention, Transportation, and Removal Policy that will permit use of detention space across the United States and improve the ability to remove individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of Justice, in consultation with other agencies as appropriate and working under the auspices of the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30, 1995.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Administration will seek support and funding from the Congress for this plan and for our efforts to double the removal of illegal aliens with final orders of deportation.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">C. <em>Identification and Removal of Criminal Aliens</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Institutional Hearing Program is successfully expediting deportation of incarcerated criminal aliens after they serve their sentences.</p>
<p class="note-body">To further expedite removal of criminal aliens from this country and reduce costs to Federal and State governments, the Department of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program of verification of the immigration status of criminal aliens within our country's prisons. In developing this program, the viability of expanding the work of the Law Enforcement Support Center should be assessed and all necessary steps taken to increase coordination and cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement officers in identification of criminal aliens.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">TARGETED DETERRENCE AREAS</h4>
<p class="note-body">Many of the Administration's illegal immigration enforcement initiatives are mutually reinforcing. For example, strong interior enforcement supports border control. While there have been efforts over the years at piecemeal cooperation, this Administration will examine, develop, and test a more comprehensive coordinated package of deterrence strategies in selected metropolitan areas by multiple Federal, State, and local agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall coordinate the development of this interagency and intergovernmental operation.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS</h4>
<p class="note-body">The law denies most government benefits to illegal aliens. The government has a duty to assure that taxpayer-supported public assistance programs are not abused. As with work authorization, enforcement of eligibility requirements relies upon a credible system of verification. The INS, working with the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall review means of improving the existing benefits verification program. In addition, we will seek new mechanisms&mdash;including increased penalties for false information used to qualify for benefits&mdash;to protect the integrity of public programs.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">ANTI-DISCRIMINATION</h4>
<p class="note-body">Our efforts to combat illegal immigration must not violate the privacy and civil rights of legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and other relevant Administration officials to vigorously protect our citizens and legal immigrants from immigration-related instances of discrimination and harassment. All illegal immigration enforcement measures shall be taken with due regard for the basic human rights of individuals and in accordance with our obligations under applicable international agreements.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">ASSISTANCE TO STATES</h4>
<p class="note-body">States today face significant costs for services provided to illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies of the past. Deterring illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to protect States from growing costs for illegal immigration. This is the first Administration to address this primary responsibility squarely. We are targeting most of our Federal dollars to those initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased burdens on States.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government provides States with billions of dollars to provide for health care, education, and other services and benefits for immigrants. This Administration is proposing increases for immigration and immigration-related spending of 25 percent in 1996 compared to 1993 levels. In addition, this Administra<!-- PDFPage:45 -->tion is the first to obtain funding from the Congress to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerated illegal aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">This Administration will continue to work with States to obtain more Federal help for certain State costs and will oppose inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION</h4>
<p class="note-body">This Administration will continue to emphasize international cooperative efforts to address illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to a Presidential Review Directive (PRD), the Department of State is now coordinating a study on United States policy toward international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct that, as part of that PRD process, this report to the National Security Council include the relationship of economic development and migration in the Western Hemisphere and, in particular, provide recommendations for further foreign economic policy measures to address causes of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of State shall coordinate an interagency effort to consider expanded arrangements with foreign governments for return of criminal and deportable aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of State also shall seek to negotiate readmission agreements for persons who could have sought asylum in the last country from which they arrived. Such agreements will take due regard of U.S. obligations under the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of State further shall implement cooperative efforts with other nations receiving smuggled aliens or those used as transhipment points by smugglers. In particular, we will look to countries in our hemisphere to join us by denying their territory as bases for smuggling operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of State shall initiate negotiations with foreign countries to secure authority for the United States Coast Guard to board source country vessels suspected of transporting smuggled aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">This directive shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The procedure prescribed by, and all the provisions of chapter 158 of title 28, shall apply to, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation, heretofore or hereafter made against aliens within the United States pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 1252(b) of this title or pursuant to section 1252a of this title or comparable provisions of any prior Act, except that&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Time for filing petition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">a petition for review may be filed not later than 90 days after the date of the issuance of the final deportation order, or, in the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony (including an alien described in section 1252a of this title), not later than 30 days after the issuance of such order;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">the venue of any petition for review under this section shall be in the judicial circuit in which the administrative proceedings before a special inquiry officer were conducted in whole or in part, or in the judicial circuit wherein is the residence, as defined in this chapter, of the petitioner, but not in more than one circuit;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Respondent; service of petition; stay of deportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">the action shall be brought against the Immigration and Naturalization Service, as respondent. Service of the petition to review shall be made upon the Attorney General of the United States and upon the official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in charge of the Service district in which the office of the clerk of the court is located. The service of the petition for review upon such official of the Service shall stay the deportation of the alien pending determination of the petition by the court, unless the court otherwise directs or unless the alien is convicted of an aggravated felony (including an alien described in section 1252a of this title), in which case the Service shall not stay the deportation of the alien pending determination of the petition of the court unless the court otherwise directs;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination upon administrative record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">except as provided in clause (B) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the petition shall be determined solely upon the administrative record upon which the deportation order is based and the Attorney General's findings of fact, if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Claim of nationality; determination or transfer to district court for hearing de novo</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">whenever any petitioner, who seeks review of an order under this section, claims to be a national of the United States and makes a showing that his claim is not frivolous, the court shall (A) pass upon the issues presented when it appears from the pleadings and affidavits filed by the parties that no genuine issue of material fact is presented; or (B) where a genuine issue of material fact as to the petitioner's nationality is presented, transfer the <!-- PDFPage:50 -->proceedings to a United States district court for the district where the petitioner has his residence for hearing de novo of the nationality claim and determination as if such proceedings were originally initiated in the district court under the provisions of section 2201 of title 28. Any such petitioner shall not be entitled to have such issue determined under section 1503(a) of this title or otherwise;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Consolidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">whenever a petitioner seeks review of an order under this section, any review sought with respect to a motion to reopen or reconsider such an order shall be consolidated with the review of the order;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Challenge of validity of deportation order in criminal proceeding; motion for judicial review before trial; hearing de novo on nationality claim; determination of motion; dismissal of indictment upon invalidity of order; appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">if the validity of a deportation order has not been judicially determined, its validity may be challenged in a criminal proceeding against the alien for violation of subsection (d) or (e) of section 1252 of this title only by separate motion for judicial review before trial. Such motion shall be determined by the court without a jury and before the trial of the general issue. Whenever a claim to United States nationality is made in such motion, and in the opinion of the court, a genuine issue of material fact as to the alien's nationality is presented, the court shall accord him a hearing de novo on the nationality claim and determine that issue as if proceedings had been initiated under the provisions of section 2201 of title 28. Any such alien shall not be entitled to have such issue determined under section 1503(a) of this title or otherwise. If no such hearing de novo as to nationality is conducted, the determination shall be made solely upon the administrative record upon which the deportation order is based and the Attorney General's findings of fact, if supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. If the deportation order is held invalid, the court shall dismiss the indictment and the United States shall have the right to appeal to the court of appeals within thirty days. The procedure on such appeals shall be as provided in the Federal rules of criminal procedure. No petition for review under this section may be filed by any alien during the pendency of a criminal proceeding against such alien for violation of subsection (d) or (e) of section 1252 of this title;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Deferment of deportation; compliance of alien with other provisions of law; detention or taking into custody of alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">nothing in this section shall be construed to require the Attorney General to defer deportation of an alien after the issuance of a deportation order because of the right of judicial review of the order granted by this section, or to relieve any alien from compliance with subsections (d) and (e) of section 1252 of this title. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to preclude the Attorney General from detaining or continuing to detain an alien or from taking him into custody pursuant to subsection (c) of section 1252 of this title at any time after the issuance of a deportation order;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Typewritten record and briefs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">it shall not be necessary to print the record or any part thereof, or the briefs, and the court shall review the proceedings on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs; and</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Habeas corpus</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation of certain aliens to habeas corpus proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any alien against whom a final order of exclusion has been made heretofore or hereafter under the provisions of section 1226 of this title or comparable provisions of any prior Act may obtain judicial review of such order by habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exhaustion of administrative remedies or departure from United States; disclosure of prior judicial proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or if he has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order. Every petition for review or for habeas corpus shall state whether the validity of the order has been upheld in any prior judicial proceeding, and, if so, the nature and date thereof, and the court in which such proceeding took place. No petition for review or for habeas corpus shall be entertained if the validity of the order has been previously determined in any civil or criminal proceeding, unless the petition presents grounds which the court finds could not have been presented in such prior proceeding, or the court finds that the remedy provided by such prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Petition contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition for review or for habeas corpus on behalf of an alien against whom a final order of deportation has been issued pursuant to section 1252a(b) of this title may challenge only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) whether the alien is in fact the alien described in the order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) whether the alien is in fact an alien described in section 1252a(b)(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) whether the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony and such conviction has become final; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) whether the alien was afforded the procedures required by section 1252a(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No court shall have jurisdiction to review any issue other than an issue described in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in fiscal year 1980, 1981, or 1982, may not exceed fifty thousand unless the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation (as defined in subsection (e) of this section), that admission of a specific number of refugees in excess of such number is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in any fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 shall be such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation, is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Admissions under this subsection shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after appropriate consultation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the determination made under this subsection for each fiscal year (beginning with fis<!-- PDFPage:75 -->cal year 1992), the President shall enumerate, with the respective number of refugees so determined, the number of aliens who were granted asylum in the previous year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations by President respecting number of admissions for humanitarian concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President determines, after appropriate consultation, that (1) an unforeseen emergency refugee situation exists, (2) the admission of certain refugees in response to the emergency refugee situation is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest, and (3) the admission to the United States of these refugees cannot be accomplished under subsection (a) of this section, the President may fix a number of refugees to be admitted to the United States during the succeeding period (not to exceed twelve months) in response to the emergency refugee situation and such admissions shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after the appropriate consultation provided under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Admission by Attorney General of refugees; criteria; admission status of spouse or child; applicability of other statutory requirements; termination of refugee status of alien, spouse or child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the numerical limitations established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion and pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, admit any refugee who is not firmly resettled in any foreign country, is determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and is admissible (except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of any refugee who qualifies for admission under paragraph (1) shall, if not otherwise entitled to admission under paragraph (1) and if not a person described in the second sentence of section 1101(a)(42) of this title, be entitled to the same admission status as such refugee if accompanying, or following to join, such refugee and if the spouse or child is admissible (except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter. Upon the spouse's or child's admission to the United States, such admission shall be charged against the numerical limitation established in accordance with the appropriate subsection under which the refugee's admission is charged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraphs (4), (5), and (7)(A) of section 1182(a) of this title shall not be applicable to any alien seeking admission to the United States under this subsection, and the Attorney General may waive any other provision of such section (other than paragraph (2)(C) or subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E) of paragraph (3)) with respect to such an alien for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. Any such waiver by the Attorney General shall be in writing and shall be granted only on an individual basis following an investigation. The Attorney General shall provide for the annual reporting to Congress of the number of waivers granted under this paragraph in the previous fiscal year and a summary of the reasons for granting such waivers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The refugee status of any alien (and of the spouse or child of the alien) may be terminated by the Attorney General pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe if the Attorney General determines that the alien was not in fact a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42) of this title at the time of the alien's admission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Oversight reporting and consultation requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before the start of each fiscal year the President shall report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate regarding the foreseeable number of refugees who will be in need of resettlement during the fiscal year and the anticipated allocation of refugee admissions during the fiscal year. The President shall provide for periodic discussions between designated representatives of the President and members of such committees regarding changes in the worldwide refugee situation, the progress of refugee admissions, and the possible need for adjustments in the allocation of admissions among refugees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as possible after representatives of the President initiate appropriate consultation with respect to the number of refugee admissions under subsection (a) of this section or with respect to the admission of refugees in response to an emergency refugee situation under subsection (b) of this section, the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall cause to have printed in the Congressional Record the substance of such consultation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination under subsection (a) of this section, a hearing to review the proposed determination shall be held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination, under subsection (b) of this section, that the number of refugee admissions should be increased because of an unforeseen emergency refugee situation, to the extent that time and the nature of the emergency refugee situation permit, a hearing to review the proposal to increase refugee admissions shall be held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admit<!-- PDFPage:80 -->ted for temporary residence if the Attorney General determines that the alien meets the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must apply for such adjustment during the 18-month period beginning on the first day of the seventh month that begins after November 6, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Performance of seasonal agricultural services and residence in the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) resided in the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">during the 12-month period ending on May 1, 1986. For purposes of the previous sentence, performance of seasonal agricultural services in the United States for more than one employer on any one day shall be counted as performance of services for only 1 man-day.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Admissible as immigrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he is admissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to permanent residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful temporary resident status under paragraph (1) to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the following date:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Group 1</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the numerical limitation established under subparagraph (C), in the case of an alien who has established, at the time of application for temporary residence under paragraph (1), that the alien performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days during each of the 12-month periods ending on May 1, 1984, 1985, and 1986, the adjustment shall occur on the first day after the end of the one-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Group 2</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of aliens to which subparagraph (A) does not apply, the adjustment shall occur on the day after the last day of the two-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Numerical limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to more than 350,000 aliens.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) During the period of temporary resident status granted an alien under paragraph (1), the Attorney General may terminate such status only upon a determination under this chapter that the alien is deportable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any alien becomes eligible for adjustment of status under paragraph (2), the Attorney General may deny adjustment to permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary resident status granted such alien under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Attorney General finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the adjustment to temporary resident status was the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation as set out in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the alien commits an act that (I) makes the alien inadmissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section, or (II) is convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authorized travel and employment during temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period an alien is in lawful temporary resident status granted under this subsection, the alien has the right to travel abroad (including commutation from a residence abroad) and shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and shall be provided an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit, in the same manner as for aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an alien who acquires the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under paragraph (1), such status not having changed, is considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as described in section 1101(a)(20) of this title), other than under any provision of the immigration laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications for adjustment of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) To whom may be made</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Within the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide that applications for adjustment of status under subsection (a) may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with the Attorney General, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with a designated entity (designated under paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant consents to the forwarding of the application to the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall provide a procedure whereby an alien may apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section at an appropriate consular office outside the United States. If the alien otherwise qualifies for such adjustment, the Attorney General shall provide such documentation of authorization to enter the United States and to have the alien's status <!-- PDFPage:81 -->adjusted upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of entities to receive applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations and other qualified State, local, community, farm labor organizations, and associations of agricultural employers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney General determines are qualified and have substantial experience, demonstrated competence, and traditional long-term involvement in the preparation and submittal of applications for adjustment of status under section 1159 or 1255 of this title, Public Law 89&ndash;732 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note], or Public Law 95&ndash;145 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Proof of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien may establish that he meets the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section through government employment records, records supplied by employers or collective bargaining organizations, and such other reliable documentation as the alien may provide. The Attorney General shall establish special procedures to credit properly work in cases in which an alien was employed under an assumed name.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Documentation of work history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) An alien applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien has worked the requisite number of man-days (as required under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing such an alien has kept proper and adequate records respecting such employment, the alien's burden of proof under clause (i) may be met by securing timely production of those records under regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the alien establishes that the alien has in fact performed the work described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section by producing sufficient evidence to show the extent of that employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference. In such a case, the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to disprove the alien's evidence with a showing which negates the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of applications by designated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each designated entity must agree to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it in accordance with paragraph (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it unless the applicant has consented to such forwarding. No such entity may make a determination required by this section to be made by the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Files and records prepared for purposes of this section by designated entities operating under this section are confidential and the Attorney General and the Service shall not have access to such files or records relating to an alien without the consent of the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Confidentiality of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither the Attorney General, nor any other official or employee of the Department of Justice, or bureau or agency thereof, may&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Anyone who uses, publishes, or permits information to be examined in violation of this paragraph shall be fined in accordance with title 18 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Penalties for false statements in applications</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Criminal penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whoever&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements which authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to engage in the practice of professional nursing as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to the United States and is authorized under such laws to be employed by the facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The attestation referred to in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title is an attestation as to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) There would be a substantial disruption through no fault of the facility in the delivery of health care services of the facility without the services of such an alien or aliens.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly employed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Either (I) the facility has taken and is taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on nonimmigrant registered nurses, or (II) the facility is subject to an approved State plan for the recruitment and retention of nurses (described in paragraph (3)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment of such an alien is not intended or designed to influence an election for a bargaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) At the time of the filing of the petition for registered nurses under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title, notice of the filing has been provided by the facility to the bargaining representative of the registered <!-- PDFPage:95 -->nurses at the facility or, where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been provided to registered nurses employed at the facility through posting in conspicuous locations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A facility is considered not to meet clause (i) (relating to an attestation of a substantial disruption in delivery of health care services) if the facility, within the previous year, laid off registered nurses. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a facility that lays off a registered nurse other than a staff nurse still meets clause (i) if, in its attestation under this subparagraph, the facility has attested that it will not replace the nurse with a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title (either through promotion or otherwise) for a period of 1 year after the date of the lay off. Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility to have taken significant steps described in such clause before Dec. 18, 1989. In the case of an alien for whom an employer has filed an attestation under this subparagraph and who is performing services at a worksite other than the employer's or other than a worksite controlled by the employer, the Secretary may waive such requirements for the attestation for the worksite as may be appropriate in order to avoid duplicative attestations, in cases of temporary, emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv)(I), each of the following shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to recruit and retain registered nurses:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Operating a training program for registered nurses at the facility or financing (or providing participation in) a training program for registered nurses elsewhere.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become registered nurses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in the geographic area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Providing adequate support services to free registered nurses from administrative and other nonnursing duties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by registered nurses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv)(I). Nothing herein shall require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subparagraph (A) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) apply to petitions filed during such 1-year period if the facility states in each such petition that it continues to comply with the conditions in the attestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A facility may meet the requirements under this paragraph with respect to more than one registered nurse in a single petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a list identifying facilities which have filed petitions for nonimmigrants under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title and, for each such facility, a copy of the facility's attestation under subparagraph (A) (and accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a facility's failure to meet conditions attested to or a facility's misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reasonable cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a misrepresentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with respect to a facility during a period of at least 1 year for nurses to be employed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) In addition to the sanctions provided under clause (iv), if the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the facility to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with such condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Labor shall provide for a process under which a State may submit to the Secretary a plan for the recruitment and retention of United States citizens and immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services as registered nurses in facilities in the State. Such a plan may include counseling and educating health workers and other individuals concerning the employment opportunities available to registered nurses. The Secretary shall pro<!-- PDFPage:96 -->vide, on an annual basis in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for the approval or disapproval of such a plan, for purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(iv)(II). Such a plan may not be considered to be approved with respect to the facility unless the plan provides for the taking of significant steps described in paragraph (2)(A)(iv)(I) with respect to registered nurses in the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The period of admission of an alien under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title shall be for an initial period of not to exceed 3 years, subject to an extension for a period or periods, not to exceed a total period of admission of 5 years (or a total period of admission of 6 years in the case of extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Attorney General).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection and section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title, the term &ldquo;facility&rdquo; includes an employer who employs registered nurses in a home setting.</p>

The Secretary shall compile, on a current basis, a list (by employer and by occupational classification) of the applications filed under this subsection. Such list shall include the wage rate, number of aliens sought, period of intended employment, and date of need. The Secretary shall make such list available for public examination in Washington, D.C. The Secretary of Labor shall review such an application only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies. Unless the Secretary finds that the application is incomplete or obviously inaccurate, the Secretary shall provide the certification described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of this title within 7 days of the date of the filing of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a petitioner's failure to meet a condition specified in an application submitted under paragraph (1) or a petitioner's misrepresentation of material facts in such an application. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives). No investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively. The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this paragraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure or misrepresentation has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 30 days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reasonable basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (C). If the Secretary determines that such a reasonable basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint, in accordance with section 556 of title 5, within 60 days after the date of the determination.

In the case of similar complaints respecting the same applicant, the Secretary may consolidate the hearings under this subparagraph on such complaints.</p>

<p class="note-body">The ongoing migration of persons to the United States in violation of our laws is a serious national problem detrimental to the interests of the United States. A particularly difficult aspect of the problem is the continuing illegal migration by sea of large numbers of undocumented aliens into the southeastern United States.

<p class="note-body">As a result of our discussions with the Governments of affected foreign countries and with agencies of the Executive Branch of our Government, I have determined that new and effective measures to curtail these unlawful arrivals are necessary. In this regard, I have determined that international cooperation to intercept vessels trafficking in illegal migrants is a necessary and proper means of insuring the effective enforcement of our laws.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not made positive recruitment efforts within a multi-state region of traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary finds that there are a significant number of qualified United States workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves available for work at the time and place needed. Positive recruitment under this paragraph is in addition to, and shall be conducted within the same time period as, the circulation through the interstate employment service system of the employer's job offer. The obligation to engage in positive recruitment under this paragraph shall terminate on the date the H&ndash;2A workers depart for the employer's place of employment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Labor shall make, not later than 20 days before the date such labor or services are first required to be performed, the certification described in subsection (a)(1) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the employer has complied with the criteria for certification (including criteria for <!-- PDFPage:127 -->the recruitment of eligible individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not been provided with referrals of, qualified eligible individuals who have indicated their availability to perform such labor or services on the terms and conditions of a job offer which meets the requirements of the Secretary.</p>

The Secretary's review of such findings and materials shall lead to the issuance of findings in furtherance of the Congressional policy that aliens not be admitted under this section unless there are not sufficient workers in the United States who are able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or service needed and that the employment of the aliens in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.

<!-- PDFPage:128 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Roles of agricultural associations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker, and an application for a labor certification with respect to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural producers which use agricultural services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of associations acting as employers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an association is a joint or sole employer of temporary agricultural workers, the certifications granted under this section to the association may be used for the certified job opportunities of any of its producer members and such workers may be transferred among its producer members to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature for which the certifications were granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of violations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Member's violation does not necessarily disqualify association or other members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual producer member of a joint employer association is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the member, the denial shall apply only to that member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the association or other member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Association's violation does not necessarily disqualify members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If an association representing agricultural producers as a joint employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, the denial shall apply only to the association and does not apply to any individual producer member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an association of agricultural producers certified as a sole employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, no individual producer member of such association may be the beneficiary of the services of temporary alien agricultural workers admitted under this section in the commodity and occupation in which such aliens were employed by the association which was denied certification during the period such denial is in force, unless such producer member employs such aliens in the commodity and occupation in question directly or through an association which is a joint employer of such workers with the producer member.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expedited administrative appeals of certain determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations shall provide for an expedited procedure for the review of a denial of certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section or a revocation of such a certification or, at the applicant's request, for a de novo administrative hearing respecting the denial or revocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after the time a new determination is requested, make a new determination on the request for certification in the case of an H&ndash;2A worker if able, willing, and qualified eligible individuals are not actually available at the time such labor or services are required and a certification was denied in whole or in part because of the availability of qualified workers. If the employer asserts that any eligible individual who has been referred is not able, willing, or qualified, the burden of proof is on the employer to establish that the individual referred is not able, willing, or qualified because of employment-related reasons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Violators disqualified for 5 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien may not be admitted to the United States as a temporary agricultural worker if the alien was admitted to the United States as such a worker within the previous five-year period and the alien during that period violated a term or condition of such previous admission.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such nonimmigrants (and domestic workers employed by the same employers) are employed in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the Secretary of Labor to make determinations and certifications under this section and under section 1182(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the Secretary's duties and responsibilities under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Miscellaneous provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall provide for such endorsement of entry and exit documents of nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii) of this title as may be necessary to carry out this section and to provide notice for purposes of section 1324a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of section 1184 of this title and the provisions of this section preempt any State or local law regulating admissibility of nonimmigrant workers.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Immigrants; nonimmigrants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the conditions hereinafter prescribed and subject to the limitations prescribed in this chapter or regulations issued thereunder, a consular officer may issue (1) to an immigrant who has made proper application therefor, an immigrant visa which shall consist of the application provided for in section 1202 of this title, visaed by such consular officer, and shall specify the foreign state, if any, to which the immigrant is charged, the immigrant's particular status under such foreign state, the preference, immediate relative, or special immigrant classification to which the alien is charged, the date on which the validity of the visa shall expire, and such additional information as may be required; and (2) to a nonimmigrant who has made proper application therefor, a nonimmigrant visa, which shall specify the classification under section 1101(a)(15) of this title of the nonimmigrant, the period during which the nonimmigrant visa shall be valid, and such additional information as may be required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Registration; photographs; waiver of requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each alien who applies for a visa shall be registered in connection with his application, and shall furnish copies of his photograph signed by him for such use as may be by regulations required. The requirements of this subsection may be waived in the discretion of the Secretary of State in the case of any alien who is within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in sections 1101(a)(15)(A), and 1101(a)(15)(G) of this title, or in the case of any alien who is granted a diplomatic visa on a diplomatic passport or on the equivalent thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of validity; requirement of visa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An immigrant visa shall be valid for such period, not exceeding four months, as shall be by regulations prescribed, except that any visa issued to a child lawfully adopted by a United States citizen and spouse while such citizen is serving abroad in the United States Armed Forces, or is employed abroad by the United States Government, or is temporarily abroad on business, shall be valid until such time, for a period not to exceed three years, as the adoptive citizen parent returns to the United States in due course of his service, employment, or business. A nonimmigrant visa shall be valid for such periods as shall be by regulations prescribed. In prescribing the period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa in the case of nationals of any foreign country who are eligible for such visas, the Secretary of State shall, insofar as practicable, accord to such nationals the same treatment upon a reciprocal basis as such foreign country accords to nationals of the United States who are within a similar class. An immigrant visa may be replaced under the original number during the fiscal year in which the original visa was issued for an immigrant who establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he was unable to use the original immigrant visa during the period of its validity because of reasons beyond his control and for which he was not responsible: <em>Provided</em>, That the immigrant is found by the consular officer to be eligible for an immigrant visa and the immigrant pays again the statutory fees for an application and an immigrant visa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Physical examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer shall require such alien to submit to a physical and mental examination in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed. Prior to the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer may require such alien to submit to a physical or mental examination, or both, if in his opinion such examination is necessary to ascertain whether such alien is eligible to receive a visa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Surrender of visa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each immigrant shall surrender his immigrant visa to the immigration officer at the port of entry, who shall endorse on the visa the date and the port of arrival, the identity of the vessel or other means of transportation by which the immigrant arrived, and such other endorsements as may be by regulations required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Surrender of documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each nonimmigrant shall present or surrender to the immigration officer at the port of entry such documents as may be by regulation required. In the case of an alien crewman not in possession of any individual documents other than a passport and until such time as it becomes practicable to issue individual documents, such alien crewman may be admitted, subject to the provisions of this part, if his name appears in the crew list of the vessel or aircraft on which he arrives and the crew list is visaed by a consular officer, but the consular officer shall have the right to exclude any alien crewman from the crew list visa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nonissuance of visas or other documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No visa or other documentation shall be issued to an alien if (1) it appears to the consular officer, from statements in the application, or in the papers submitted therewith, that such alien is ineligible to receive a visa or such other documentation under section 1182 of this title, or any other provision of law, (2) the application fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, or the regulations issued thereunder, or (3) the consular officer knows or has reason to believe that such alien is ineligible to receive a visa or such other documentation under section 1182 of this title, or any other provision of law: <em>Provided</em>, That a visa or other documentation may be issued to an alien who is within the purview of section 1182(a)(4) of this title, if such alien is otherwise entitled to receive a visa or other documentation, upon receipt of notice by the consular officer from the Attorney General of the giving of a bond or undertaking providing indemnity as in the case of aliens admitted under section 1183 of this title: <em>Provided further</em>, That a visa may be issued to an alien defined in section 1101(a)(15)(B) or (F) of this title, if such alien is otherwise entitled to receive a visa, upon receipt of a notice by the consular officer from the At<!-- PDFPage:131 -->torney General of the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such conditions as the consular officer shall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of the time for which such alien has been admitted by the Attorney General, as provided in section 1184(a) of this title, or upon failure to maintain the status under which he was admitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section 1258 of this title, such alien will depart from the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Nonadmission upon arrival</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle any alien, to whom a visa or other documentation has been issued, to enter the United States, if, upon arrival at a port of entry in the United States, he is found to be inadmissible under this chapter, or any other provision of law. The substance of this subsection shall appear upon every visa application.</p>

No master or commanding officer of any such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance papers for his vessel or aircraft until he or the authorized agent has deposited such list or lists and accompanying documents with the immigration officer at such port and made oath that they are full and complete as to the information required to be contained therein, except that in the case of vessels or aircraft which the Attorney General determines are making regular trips to ports of the United States, the Attorney General may, when expedient, arrange for the delivery of lists of outgoing persons at a later date. This subsection shall not require the master or commanding officer, or authorized agent, owner, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft to furnish a list or manifest relating (1) to an alien crewman or (2) to any other person departing by air on a trip originating in the United States who is destined to foreign contiguous territory, except (with respect to such departure by air) as may be required by regulations issued pursuant to section 1229 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1225. Inspection by immigration officers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Powers of officers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The inspection, other than the physical and mental examination, of aliens (including alien crewmen) seeking admission or readmission to or the privilege of passing through the United States shall be conducted by immigration officers, except as otherwise provided in regard to special inquiry officers. All aliens arriving at ports of the United States shall be examined by one or more immigration officers at the discretion of the Attorney General and under such regulations as he may prescribe. Immigration officers are authorized and empowered to board and search any vessel, aircraft, railway car, or other conveyance, or vehicle in which they believe aliens are being brought into the United States. The Attorney General and any immigration officer, including special inquiry officers, shall have power to administer oaths and to take and consider evidence of or from any person touching the privilege of any alien or person he believes or suspects to be an alien to enter, reenter, pass through, or reside in the United States or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this chapter and the administration of the Service, and, where such action may be necessary, to make a written record of such evidence. Any person coming into the United States may be required to state under oath the purpose or purposes for which he comes, the length of time he intends to remain in the United States, whether or not he intends to remain in the United States permanently and, if an alien, whether he intends to become a citizen thereof, and such other items of information as will aid the immigration officer in determining whether he is a national of the United States or an alien and, if the latter, whether he belongs to any of the excluded classes enumerated in section 1182 of this title. The Attorney General and any immigration officer, including special inquiry officers, shall have power to require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses before immigration officers and special inquiry officers and the production of books, papers, and documents relating to the privilege of any person to enter, reenter, reside in, or pass through the United States or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this chapter and the administration of the Service, and to that end may invoke the aid of any court of the United States. Any United States district court within the jurisdiction of which investigations or inquiries are being conducted by an immigration officer or special inquiry officer may, in the event of neglect or refusal to respond to a subpena issued under this subsection or refusal to testify before an immigration officer or special inquiry officer, issue an order requiring such persons to appear before an immigration officer or special inquiry officer, produce books, papers, and documents if demanded, and testify, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Detention for further inquiry; challenge of favorable decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien (other than an alien crewman), and except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section and in section 1323(d) of this title, who may not appear to the examining immigration officer at the port of arrival to be clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to land shall be detained for further inquiry to be conducted by a special inquiry officer. The decision of the examining immigration officer, if favorable to the admission of any alien, shall be subject to challenge by any other immigration officer and such challenge shall operate to take the alien, whose privilege to land is so challenged, before a special inquiry officer for further inquiry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary exclusion; permanent exclusion by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alien (including an alien crewman) who may appear to the examining immigration officer or to the special inquiry officer during the examination before either of such officers to be excludable under subparagraph (A) (other than clause (ii)), (B), or (C) of section 1182(a)(3) of this title shall be temporarily excluded, and no further inquiry by a special inquiry officer shall be conducted until after the case is reported to the Attorney General together with any such written statement and accompanying information, if any, as the alien or his representative may desire to submit in connection therewith and such an inquiry or further inquiry is directed by the Attorney General. If the Attorney General is satisfied that the alien is excludable under any of such paragraphs on the basis of information of a confidential nature, the disclosure of which the Attorney General, in the exercise of his discretion, and after consultation with the appropriate security agencies of the Government, concludes would be prejudicial to the public interest, safety, or security, he may in his discretion order such alien to be excluded and deported without any inquiry or further inquiry by a special inquiry officer. Nothing in this subsection shall be regarded as requiring an inquiry before a special inquiry officer in the case of an alien crewman.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A special inquiry officer shall conduct proceedings under this section, administer oaths, present and receive evidence, and interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien or witnesses. He shall have authority in any case to determine whether an arriving alien who has been detained for further inquiry under section 1225 of this title shall be allowed to enter or shall be excluded and deported. The determination of such special inquiry officer shall be based only on the evidence produced at the inquiry. No special inquiry officer shall conduct a proceeding in any case under this section in which he shall have participated in investigative functions or in which he shall have participated (except as provided in this subsection) in prosecuting functions. Proceedings before a special inquiry officer under this section shall be conducted in accordance with this section, the applicable provisions of sections 1225 and 1357(b) of this title, and such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining admissibility of a person to the United States under the provisions of this section. At such inquiry, which shall be kept separate and apart from the public, the alien may have one friend or relative present, under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Attorney General. A complete record of the proceedings and of all testimony and evidence produced at such inquiry, shall be kept.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From a decision of a special inquiry officer excluding an alien, such alien may take a timely appeal to the Attorney General, and any such alien shall be advised of his right to take such appeal. No appeal may be taken from a temporary exclusion under section 1225(c) of this title. From a decision of the special inquiry officer to admit an alien, the immigration officer in charge at the port where the inquiry is held may take a timely appeal to the Attorney General. An appeal by the alien, or such officer in charge, shall operate to stay any final action with respect to any alien whose case is so appealed until the final decision of the Attorney General is made. Except as provided in section 1225(c) of this title such decision shall be rendered solely upon the evidence adduced before the special inquiry officer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Finality of decision of special inquiry officers</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1227. Immediate deportation of aliens excluded from admission or entering in violation of law</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maintenance expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any alien (other than an alien crewman) arriving in the United States who is excluded under this chapter, shall be immediately deported, in accommodations of the same class in which he arrived, unless the Attorney General, in an individual case, in his discretion, concludes that immediate deportation is not practicable or proper. Deportation shall be to the country in which the alien boarded the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived in the United States, unless the alien boarded such vessel or aircraft in foreign territory contiguous to the United States or in any island adjacent thereto or adjacent to the United States and the alien is not a native, citizen, subject or national of, or does not have a residence in, such foreign contiguous territory or adjacent island, in which case the deportation shall instead be to the country in which is located the port at which the alien embarked for such foreign contiguous territory or adjacent island. The cost of the maintenance including detention expenses and expenses incident to detention of any such alien while he is being detained shall be borne by the owner or owners of the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived, except that the cost of maintenance (including detention expenses and expenses incident to detention while the alien is being detained prior to the time he is offered for deportation to the transportation line which brought him to the United States) shall not be assessed against the owner or owners of such vessel or aircraft if (A) the alien was in possession of a valid, unexpired immigrant visa, or (B) the alien (other than an alien crewman) was in possession of a valid, unexpired nonimmigrant visa or other document authorizing such alien to apply for temporary admission to the United States or an unexpired reentry permit issued to him, and (i) such application was made within one hundred and twenty days of the date of issuance of the visa or other document, or in the case of an alien in possession of a reentry permit, within one hundred and twenty days of the date on which the alien was last examined and admitted by the Service, or (ii) in the event the application was made later than one hundred and twenty days of the date of issuance of the visa or other document or such examination and admission, if the owner or owners of such vessel or aircraft established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the ground of exclusion could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence prior to the alien's embarkation, or (C) the person claimed United States nationality or citizenship and was in possession of an unexpired United States passport issued to him by competent authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the government of the country designated in paragraph (1) will not accept the alien into its territory, the alien's deportation shall be directed by the Attorney General, in his discretion and without necessarily giving any priority or preference because of their order as herein set forth, either to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the country of which the alien is a subject, citizen, or national;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the country in which he was born;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the country in which he has a residence; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any country which is willing to accept the alien into its territory, if deportation to any of the foregoing countries is impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unlawful practice of transportation lines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any master, commanding officer, purser, person in charge, agent, owner, or consignee of any vessel or aircraft (1) to refuse to receive any alien (other than an alien crewman), ordered deported under this section back on board such vessel or aircraft or another vessel or aircraft owned or operated by the same interests; (2) to fail to detain any alien (other than an alien crewman) on board any such vessel or at the airport of arrival of the aircraft when required by this chapter or if so ordered by an immigration officer, or to fail or refuse to deliver him for medical or other inspection, or for further medical or other inspection, as and when so ordered by such officer; (3) to refuse or fail to remove him from the United States to the country to which his deportation has been directed; (4) to fail to pay the cost of his maintenance while being detained as re<!-- PDFPage:141 -->quired by this section; (5) to take any fee, deposit, or consideration on a contingent basis to be kept or returned in case the alien is landed or excluded; or (6) knowingly to bring to the United States any alien (other than an alien crewman) excluded or arrested and deported under any provision of law until such alien may be lawfully entitled to reapply for admission to the United States. If it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that any such master, commanding officer, purser, person in charge, agent, owner, or consignee of any vessel or aircraft has violated any of the provisions of this section, such master, commanding officer, purser, person in charge, agent, owner, or consignee shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $2,000 for each violation. No such vessel or aircraft shall have clearance from any port of the United States while any such fine is unpaid or while the question of liability to pay any such fine is being determined, nor shall any such fine be remitted or refunded, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit with the Commissioner of a bond or undertaking approved by the Attorney General or a sum sufficient to cover such fine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transportation expense of deportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien shall be deported on a vessel or aircraft owned by the same person who owns the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States, unless it is impracticable to so deport the alien within a reasonable time. The transportation expense of the alien's deportation shall be borne by the owner or owners of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived. If the deportation is effected on a vessel or aircraft not owned by such owner or owners, the transportation expense of the alien's deportation may be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter and recovered by civil suit from any owner, agent, or consignee of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Stay of deportation; payment of maintenance expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, under such conditions as are by regulations prescribed, may stay the deportation of any alien deportable under this section, if in his judgment the testimony of such alien is necessary on behalf of the United States in the prosecution of offenders against any provision of this chapter or other laws of the United States. The cost of maintenance of any person so detained resulting from a stay of deportation under this subsection and a witness fee in the sum of $1 per day for each day such person is so detained may be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this subchapter. Such alien may be released under bond in the penalty of not less than $500 with security approved by the Attorney General on condition that such alien shall be produced when required as a witness and for deportation, and on such other conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deportation of alien accompanying physically disabled alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the certificate of an examining medical officer to the effect that an alien ordered to be excluded and deported under this section is helpless from sickness or mental and physical disability, or infancy, if such alien is accompanied by another alien whose protection or guardianship is required by the alien ordered excluded and deported, such accompanying alien may also be excluded and deported, and the master, commanding officer, agent, owner, or consignee of the vessel or aircraft in which such alien and accompanying alien arrived in the United States shall be required to return the accompanying alien in the same manner as other aliens denied admission and ordered deported under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General is authorized (1) by regulation to designate as ports of entry for aliens arriving by aircraft any of the ports of entry for civil aircraft designated as such in accordance with law; (2) by regulation to provide such reasonable requirements for aircraft in civil air navigation with respect to giving notice of intention to land in advance of landing, or notice of landing, as shall be deemed necessary for purposes of administration and enforcement of this chapter; and (3) by regulation to provide for the application to civil air navigation of the provisions of this chapter where not expressly so provided in this chapter to such extent and upon such conditions as he deems necessary. Any person who violates any regulation made under this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $2,000 which may be remitted or mitigated by the Attorney General in accordance with such proceedings as the Attorney General shall by regulation prescribe. In case the violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft, and such aircraft may be libeled therefore in the appropriate United States court. The determination by the Attorney General and remission or mitigation of the civil penalty shall be final. In case the violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a <!-- PDFPage:143 -->lien upon the aircraft and may be collected by proceedings in rem which shall conform as nearly as may be to civil suits in admiralty. The Supreme Court of the United States, and under its direction other courts of the United States, are authorized to prescribe rules regulating such proceedings against aircraft in any particular not otherwise provided by law. Any aircraft made subject to a lien by this section may be summarily seized by, and placed in the custody of such persons as the Attorney General may by regulation prescribe. The aircraft may be released from such custody upon deposit of such amount not exceeding $2,000 as the Attorney General may prescribe, or of a bond in such sum and with such sureties as the Attorney General may prescribe, conditioned upon the payment of the penalty which may be finally determined by the Attorney General.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Arrest and custody; review of determination by court; aliens committing aggravated felonies; report to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Pending a determination of deportability in the case of any alien as provided in subsection (b) of this section, such alien may, upon warrant of the Attorney General, be arrested and taken into custody. Except as provided in paragraph (2), any such alien taken into custody may, in the discretion of the Attorney General and pending such final determination of deportability, (A) be continued in custody; or (B) be released under bond in the amount of not less than $500 with security approved by the Attorney General, containing such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe; or (C) be released on conditional parole. But such bond or parole, whether heretofore or hereafter authorized, may be revoked at any time by the Attorney General, in his discretion, and the alien may be returned to custody under the warrant which initiated the proceedings against him and detained until final determination of his deportability. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to review or revise any determination of the Attorney General concerning detention, release on bond, or parole pending final decision of deportability upon a conclusive showing in habeas corpus proceedings that the Attorney General is not proceeding with such reasonable dispatch as may be warranted by the particular facts and circumstances in the case of any alien to determine deportability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Attorney General shall take into custody any alien convicted of an aggravated felony upon release of the alien (regardless of whether or not such release is on parole, supervised release, or probation, and regardless of the possibility of rearrest or further confinement in respect of the same offense). Notwithstanding paragraph (1) or subsections (c) and (d) of this section but subject to subparagraph (B), the Attorney General shall not release such felon from custody.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General may not release from custody any lawfully admitted alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony, either before or after a determination of deportability, unless the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that such alien is not a threat to the community and that the alien is likely to appear before any scheduled hearings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Attorney General shall devise and implement a system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to make available, daily (on a 24-hour basis), to Federal, State, and local authorities the investigative resources of the Service to determine whether individuals arrested by such authorities for aggravated felonies are aliens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to designate and train officers and employees of the Service within each district to serve as a liaison to Federal, State, and local <!-- PDFPage:150 -->law enforcement and correctional agencies and courts with respect to the arrest, conviction, and release of any alien charged with an aggravated felony; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) which uses computer resources to maintain a current record of aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony and who have been deported; such record shall be made available to inspectors at ports of entry and to border patrol agents at sector headquarters for purposes of immediate identification of any such previously deported alien seeking to reenter the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall submit reports to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate at the end of the 6-month period and at the end of the 18-month period beginning on the effective date of this paragraph which describe in detail specific efforts made by the Attorney General to implement this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proceedings to determine deportability; removal expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A special inquiry officer shall conduct proceedings under this section to determine the deportability of any alien, and shall administer oaths, present and receive evidence, interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien or witnesses, and, as authorized by the Attorney General, shall make determinations, including orders of deportation. Determination of deportability in any case shall be made only upon a record made in a proceeding before a special inquiry officer, at which the alien shall have reasonable opportunity to be present, unless by reason of the alien's mental incompetency it is impracticable for him to be present, in which case the Attorney General shall prescribe necessary and proper safeguards for the rights and privileges of such alien. If any alien has been given a reasonable opportunity to be present at a proceeding under this section, and without reasonable cause fails or refuses to attend or remain in attendance at such proceeding, the special inquiry officer may proceed to a determination in like manner as if the alien were present. In any case or class of cases in which the Attorney General believes that such procedure would be of aid in making a determination, he may require specifically or by regulation that an additional immigration officer shall be assigned to present the evidence on behalf of the United States and in such case such additional immigration officer shall have authority to present evidence, and to interrogate, examine and cross-examine the alien or other witnesses in the proceedings. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to diminish the authority conferred upon the special inquiry officer conducting such proceedings. No special inquiry officer shall conduct a proceeding in any case under this section in which he shall have participated in investigative functions or in which he shall have participated (except as provided in this subsection) in prosecuting functions. Proceedings before a special inquiry officer acting under the provisions of this section shall be in accordance with such regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as the Attorney General shall prescribe. Such regulations shall include requirements that are consistent with section 1252b of this title and that provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alien shall be given notice, reasonable under all the circumstances, of the nature of the charges against him and of the time and place at which the proceedings will be held,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the Government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him, to present evidence on his own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) no decision of deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as provided in section 1252a(d) of this title, the procedure so prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien under this section. In any case in which an alien is ordered deported from the United States under the provisions of this chapter, or of any other law or treaty, the decision of the Attorney General shall be final. In the discretion of the Attorney General, and under such regulations as he may prescribe, deportation proceedings, including issuance of a warrant of arrest, and a finding of deportability under this section need not be required in the case of any alien who admits to belonging to a class of aliens who are deportable under section 1251 of this title if such alien voluntarily departs from the United States at his own expense, or is removed at Government expense as hereinafter authorized, unless the Attorney General has reason to believe that such alien is deportable under paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of section 1251(a) of this title. If any alien who is authorized to depart voluntarily under the preceding sentence is financially unable to depart at his own expense and the Attorney General deems his removal to be in the best interest of the United States, the expense of such removal may be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Final order of deportation; place of detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a final order of deportation under administrative processes is made against any alien, the Attorney General shall have a period of six months from the date of such order, or, if judicial review is had, then from the date of the final order of the court, within which to effect the alien's departure from the United States, during which period, at the Attorney General's discretion, the alien may be detained, released on bond in an amount and containing such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe, or released on such other condition as the Attorney General may prescribe. Any court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to review or revise any determination of the Attorney General concerning detention, release on bond, or other release during such six-month period upon a conclusive showing in habeas corpus proceedings that the Attorney General is not proceeding with such reasonable dispatch as may be warranted by the particular facts and circumstances in the case of any alien to effect <!-- PDFPage:151 -->such alien's departure from the United States within such six-month period. If deportation has not been practicable, advisable, or possible, or departure of the alien from the United States under the order of deportation has not been effected, within such six-month period, the alien shall become subject to such further supervision and detention pending eventual deportation as is authorized in this section. The Attorney General is authorized and directed to arrange for appropriate places of detention for those aliens whom he shall take into custody and detain under this section. Where no Federal buildings are available or buildings adapted or suitably located for the purpose are available for rental, the Attorney General is authorized, notwithstanding section 5 of title 41 or section 278a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1252_1_target" name="1252_1">1</a></sup> of title 40 to expend, from the appropriation provided for the administration and enforcement of the immigration laws, such amounts as may be necessary for the acquisition of land and the erection, acquisition, maintenance, operation, remodeling, or repair of buildings, sheds, and office quarters (including living quarters for officers where none are otherwise available), and adjunct facilities, necessary for the detention of aliens. For the purposes of this section an order of deportation heretofore or hereafter entered against an alien in legal detention or confinement, other than under an immigration process, shall be considered as being made as of the moment he is released from such detention or confinement, and not prior thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supervision of deportable alien; violation by alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alien, against whom a final order of deportation as defined in subsection (c) of this section heretofore or hereafter issued has been outstanding for more than six months, shall, pending eventual deportation, be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. Such regulations shall include provisions which will require any alien subject to supervision (1) to appear from time to time before an immigration officer for identification; (2) to submit, if necessary, to medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the United States; (3) to give information under oath as to his nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and such other information, whether or not related to the foregoing, as the Attorney General may deem fit and proper; and (4) to conform to such reasonable written restrictions on his conduct or activities as are prescribed by the Attorney General in his case. Any alien who shall willfully fail to comply with such regulations, or willfully fail to appear or to give information or submit to medical or psychiatric examination if required, or knowingly give false information in relation to the requirements of such regulations, or knowingly violate a reasonable restriction imposed upon his conduct or activity, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or shall be imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Penalty for willful failure to depart; suspension of sentence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any alien against whom a final order of deportation is outstanding by reason of being a member of any of the classes described in section 1251(a) of this title, who shall willfully fail or refuse to depart from the United States within a period of six months from the date of the final order of deportation under administrative processes, or, if judicial review is had, then from the date of the final order of the court, or shall willfully fail or refuse to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to his departure, or who shall connive or conspire, or take any other action, designed to prevent or hamper or with the purpose of preventing or hampering his departure pursuant to such order of deportation, or who shall willfully fail or refuse to present himself for deportation at the time and place required by the Attorney General pursuant to such order of deportation, shall upon conviction be guilty of a felony, and shall be imprisoned not more than four years, or shall be imprisoned not more than ten years if the alien is a member of any of the classes described in paragraph (1)(E), (2), (3), or (4) of section 1251(a) of this title.:&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1252_2_target" name="1252_2">2</a></sup> <em>Provided</em>, That this subsection shall not make it illegal for any alien to take any proper steps for the purpose of securing cancellation of or exemption from such order of deportation or for the purpose of securing his release from incarceration or custody: <em>Provided further</em>, That the court may for good cause suspend the sentence of such alien and order his release under such conditions as the court may prescribe. In determining whether good cause has been shown to justify releasing the alien, the court shall take into account such factors as (1) the age, health, and period of detention of the alien; (2) the effect of the alien's release upon the national security and public peace or safety; (3) the likelihood of the alien's resuming or following a course of conduct which made or would make him deportable; (4) the character of the efforts made by such alien himself and by representatives of the country or countries to which his deportation is directed to expedite the alien's departure from the United States; (5) the reason for the inability of the Government of the United States to secure passports, other travel documents, or deportation facilities from the country or countries to which the alien has been ordered deported; and (6) the eligibility of the alien for discretionary relief under the immigration laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Unlawful reentry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Should the Attorney General find that any alien has unlawfully reentered the United States after having previously departed or been deported pursuant to an order of deportation, whether before or after June 27, 1952, on any ground described in any of the paragraphs enumerated in subsection (e) of this section, the previous order of deportation shall be deemed to be reinstated from its original date and such alien shall be deported under such previous order at any time subsequent to such reentry. For the purposes of subsection (e) of this section the date on which the finding is made that such reinstatement is appropriate shall be deemed the date of the final order of deportation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:152 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Voluntary deportation; payment of expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any alien, subject to supervision or detention under subsections (c) or (d) of this section, is able to depart from the United States under the order of deportation, except that he is financially unable to pay his passage, the Attorney General may in his discretion permit such alien to depart voluntarily, and the expense of such passage to the country to which he is destined may be paid from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter, unless such payment is otherwise provided for under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Service of prison sentence prior to deportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien sentenced to imprisonment shall not be deported until such imprisonment has been terminated by the release of the alien from confinement. Parole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of rearrest or further confinement in respect of the same offense shall not be a ground for deferral of deportation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Expeditious deportation of convicted aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an alien who is convicted of an offense which makes the alien subject to deportation, the Attorney General shall begin any deportation proceeding as expeditiously as possible after the date of the conviction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Incarceration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the chief executive officer of a State (or, if appropriate, a political subdivision of the State) exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien submits a written request to the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall, as determined by the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enter into a contractual arrangement which provides for compensation to the State or a political subdivision of the State, as may be appropriate, with respect to the incarceration of the undocumented criminal alien; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) take the undocumented criminal alien into the custody of the Federal Government and incarcerate the alien.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Compensation under paragraph (1)(A) shall be the average cost of incarceration of a prisoner in the relevant State as determined by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;undocumented criminal alien&rdquo; means an alien who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has been convicted of a felony and sentenced to a term of imprisonment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) was the subject of exclusion or deportation proceedings at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) was admitted as a nonimmigrant and at the time he or she was taken into custody by the State or a political subdivision of the State has failed to maintain the nonimmigrant status in which the alien was admitted or to which it was changed under section 1258 of this title, or to comply with the conditions of any such status.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall give priority to the Federal incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens who have committed aggravated felonies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall ensure that undocumented criminal aliens incarcerated in Federal facilities pursuant to this subsection are held in facilities which provide a level of security appropriate to the crimes for which they were convicted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection, of which the following amounts may be appropriated from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $130,000,000 for fiscal year 1995;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1996;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deportation of criminal aliens</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) in general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall provide for the availability of special deportation proceedings at certain Federal, State, and local correctional facilities for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies (as defined in section 1101(a)(43) of this title). Such proceedings shall be conducted in conformity with section 1252 of this title (except as otherwise provided in this section), and in a manner which eliminates the need for additional detention at any processing center of the Service and in a manner which assures expeditious deportation, where warranted, following the end of the alien's incarceration for the underlying sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who is taken into custody by the Attorney General pursuant to section 1252(a)(2) of this title, the Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility at which other such aliens are detained. In the selection of such facility, the Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the alien's access to counsel and right to counsel under section 1362 of this title are not impaired.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Expedited proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General shall provide for <!-- PDFPage:155 -->the initiation and, to the extent possible, the completion of deportation proceedings, and any administrative appeals thereof, in the case of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony before the alien's release from incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the Attorney General to effect the deportation of any alien sentenced to actual incarceration, before release from the penitentiary or correctional institution where such alien is confined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Attorney General shall review and evaluate deportation proceedings conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Comptroller General shall monitor, review, and evaluate deportation proceedings conducted under this section. Within 18 months after the effective date of this section, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to such Committees concerning the extent to which deportation proceedings conducted under this section may adversely affect the ability of such aliens to contest deportation effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deportation of aliens who are not permanent residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an alien described in paragraph (2), determine the deportability of such alien under section 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to conviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an order of deportation pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subsection or section 1252(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time at which proceedings under this section commenced; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not eligible for any relief from deportation under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General may not execute any order described in paragraph (1) until 30 calendar days have passed from the date that such order was issued, unless waived by the alien, in order that the alien has an opportunity to apply for judicial review under section 1105a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General under this subsection shall be in accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The Attorney General shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the charges and of the opportunity described in subparagraph (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such proccedings, as the alien shall choose;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial deportation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a United States district court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of deportation at the time of sentencing against an alien whose criminal conviction causes such alien to be deportable under section 1251(a)(2)(A) of this title, if such an order has been requested by the United States Attorney with the concurrence of the Commissioner and if the court chooses to exercise such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding section 1252b of this title, the United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner, shall file at least 30 days prior to the date set for sentencing a charge containing factual allegations regarding the alienage of the defendant and identifying the crime or crimes which make the defendant deportable under section 1251(a)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If the court determines that the defendant has presented substantial evidence to establish prima facie eligibility for relief from deportation under this chapter, the Commissioner shall provide the court with a recommendation and report regarding the alien's eligibility for relief. The court shall either grant or deny the relief sought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him or her, to present evidence on his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The court, for the purposes of determining whether to enter an order described in paragraph (1), shall only consider evidence that would be admissible in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 1252(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the information a court of the United States may receive or consider for the purposes of imposing an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The court may order the alien deported if the Attorney General demonstrates that the alien is deportable under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice, appeal, and execution of judicial order of deportation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) A judicial order of deportation or denial of such order may be appealed by either party to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the district court is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), such appeal shall be considered consistent with the requirements described in section 1105a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Upon execution by the defendant of a valid waiver of the right to appeal the convic<!-- PDFPage:156 -->tion on which the order of deportation is based, the expiration of the period described in section 1105a(a)(1) of this title, or the final dismissal of an appeal from such conviction, the order of deportation shall become final and shall be executed at the end of the prison term in accordance with the terms of the order. If the conviction is reversed on direct appeal, the order entered pursuant to this section shall be void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) As soon as is practicable after entry of a judicial order of deportation, the Commissioner shall provide the defendant with written notice of the order of deportation, which shall designate the defendant's country of choice for deportation and any alternate country pursuant to section 1253(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Denial of judicial order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Denial without a decision on the merits of a request for a judicial order of deportation shall not preclude the Attorney General from initiating deportation proceedings pursuant to section 1252 of this title upon the same ground of deportability or upon any other ground of deportability provided under section 1251(a) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Acceptance by designated country; deportation upon nonacceptance by country</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The deportation of an alien in the United States provided for in this chapter, or any other Act or treaty, shall be directed by the Attorney General to a country promptly designated by the alien if that country is willing to accept him into its territory, unless the Attorney General, in his discretion, concludes that deportation to such country would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States. No alien shall be permitted to make more than one such designation, nor shall any alien designate, as the place to which he wishes to be deported, any foreign territory contiguous to the United States or any island adjacent thereto or adjacent to the United States unless such alien is a native, citizen, subject, or national of, or had a residence in such designated foreign contiguous territory or adjacent island. If the government of the country designated by the alien fails finally to advise the Attorney General within three months following original inquiry whether that government will or will not accept such alien into its territory, such designation may thereafter be disregarded. Thereupon deportation of such alien shall be directed to any country of which such alien is a subject, national, or citizen if such country is willing to accept him into its territory. If the government of such country fails finally to advise the Attorney General or the alien within three months following the date of original inquiry, or within such other period as the Attorney General shall deem reasonable under the circumstances in a particular case, whether that government will or will not accept such alien into its territory, then such deportation shall be directed by the Attorney General within his discretion and without necessarily giving any priority or preference because of their order as herein set forth either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the country from which such alien last entered the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the country in which is located the foreign port at which such alien embarked for the United States or for foreign contiguous territory;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:160 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to the country in which he was born;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to the country in which the place of his birth is situated at the time he is ordered deported;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to any country in which he resided prior to entering the country from which he entered the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to the country which had sovereignty over the birthplace of the alien at the time of his birth; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) if deportation to any of the foregoing places or countries is impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible, then to any country which is willing to accept such alien into its territory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deportation during war</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the United States is at war and the deportation, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, of any alien who is deportable under any law of the United States shall be found by the Attorney General to be impracticable, inadvisable, inconvenient, or impossible because of enemy occupation of the country from which such alien came or wherein is located the foreign port at which he embarked for the United States or because of reasons connected with the war, such alien may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be deported as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such alien is a citizen or subject of a country whose recognized government is in exile, to the country in which is located that government in exile if that country will permit him to enter its territory; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such alien is a citizen or subject of a country whose recognized government is not in exile, then to a country or any political or territorial subdivision thereof which is proximate to the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, or, with the consent of the country of which the alien is a citizen or subject, to any other country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment of deportation costs; within five years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If deportation proceedings are instituted at any time within five years after the entry of the alien for causes existing prior to or at the time of entry, the cost of removal to the port of deportation shall be at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter, and the deportation from such port shall be at the expense of the owner or owners of the vessels, aircraft, or other transportation lines by which such alien came to the United States, or if in the opinion of the Attorney General that is not practicable, at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter: <em>Provided</em>, That the costs of the deportation of any such alien from such port shall not be assessed against the owner or owners of the vessels, aircraft, or other transportation lines in the case of any alien who arrived in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa and who was inspected and admitted to the United States for permanent residence. In the case of an alien crewman, if deportation proceedings are instituted at any time within five years after the granting of the last conditional permit to land temporarily under the provisions of section 1282 of this title, the cost of removal to the port of deportation shall be at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter and the deportation from such port shall be at the expense of the owner or owners of the vessels or aircraft by which such alien came to the United States, or if in the opinion of the Attorney General that is not practicable, at the expense of the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cost of deportation, subsequent to five years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If deportation proceedings are instituted later than five years after the entry of the alien, or in the case of an alien crewman later than five years after the granting of the last conditional permit to land temporarily, the cost thereof shall be payable from the appropriation for the enforcement of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Refusal to transport or to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A failure or refusal on the part of the master, commanding officer, agent, owner, charterer, or consignee of a vessel, aircraft, or other transportation line to comply with the order of the Attorney General to take on board, guard safely, and transport to the destination specified any alien ordered to be deported under the provisions of this chapter, or a failure or refusal by any such person to comply with an order of the Attorney General to pay deportation expenses in accordance with the requirements of this section, shall be punished by the imposition of a penalty in the sum and manner prescribed in section 1227(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of expenses of physically incapable deportees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When in the opinion of the Attorney General the mental or physical condition of an alien being deported is such as to require personal care and attendance, the Attorney General shall, when necessary, employ a suitable person for that purpose who shall accompany such alien to his final destination, and the expense incident to such service shall be defrayed in the same manner as the expense of deporting the accompanied alien is defrayed, and any failure or refusal to defray such expenses shall be punished in the manner prescribed by subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Countries delaying acceptance of deportees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the notification by the Attorney General that any country upon request denies or unduly delays acceptance of the return of any alien who is a national, citizen, subject, or resident thereof, the Secretary of State shall instruct consular officers performing their duties in the territory of such country to discontinue the issuance of immigrant visas to nationals, citizens, subjects, or residents of such country, until such time as the Attorney General shall inform the Secretary of State that such country has accepted such alien.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Withholding of deportation or return</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall not deport or return any alien (other than an alien described in section 1251(a)(4)(D) of this title) to a country if the Attorney General determines that such alien's life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:161 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any alien if the Attorney General determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alien ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there are serious reasons for considering that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the United States prior to the arrival of the alien in the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) there are reasonable grounds for regarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subparagraph (B), an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Granting of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an alien who is a national of a foreign state designated under subsection (b) of this section (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such designated state) and who meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Attorney General, in accordance with this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may grant the alien temporary protected status in the United States and shall not deport the alien from the United States during the period in which such status is in effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States and provide the alien with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duration of work authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Work authorization provided under this section shall be effective throughout the period the alien is in temporary protected status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Upon the granting of temporary protected status under this section, the Attorney General shall provide the alien with information concerning such status under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If, at the time of initiation of a deportation proceeding against an alien, the foreign state (of which the alien is a national) is designated under subsection (b) of this section, <!-- PDFPage:165 -->the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If, at the time of designation of a foreign state under subsection (b) of this section, an alien (who is a national of such state) is in a deportation proceeding under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notices under this paragraph shall be provided in a form and language that the alien can understand.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Temporary treatment for eligible aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an alien who can establish a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), but for the fact that the period of registration under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iv) of this section has not begun, until the alien has had a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30 days of such period, the Attorney General shall provide for the benefits of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), until a final determination with respect to the alien's eligibility for such benefits under paragraph (1) has been made, the alien shall be provided such benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Clarification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to deny temporary protected status to an alien based on the alien's immigration status or to require any alien, as a condition of being granted such status, either to relinquish nonimmigrant or other status the alien may have or to execute any waiver of other rights under this chapter. The granting of temporary protected status under this section shall not be considered to be inconsistent with the granting of nonimmigrant status under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, may designate any foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing armed conflict within the state and, due to such conflict, requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that state (or to the part of the state) would pose a serious threat to their personal safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Attorney General finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to the state of aliens who are nationals of the state, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the foreign state officially has requested designation under this subparagraph; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Attorney General finds that there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state from returning to the state in safety, unless the Attorney General finds that permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of the designation (including a statement of the findings under this paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published in the Federal Register. In such notice, the Attorney General shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign state designated who are (or within the effective period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status in the United States.</p>

Nothing in this subsection or section 1101(a)(27)(J) of this title shall be construed as authorizing an alien to apply for admission or be admitted to the United States in order to obtain special immigrant status described in such section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Record of admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after consultation with the Secretary of State, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the alien has shown compelling reasons demonstrating both that the alien is unable to return to the country represented by the government which accredited the alien or the member of the alien's immediate family and that adjustment of the alien's status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence would be in the national interest, that the alien is a person of good moral character, that he is admissible for permanent residence under this chapter, and that such action would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or security, the Attorney General, in his discretion, may record the alien's lawful admission for permanent residence as of the date the order of the Attorney General approving the application for adjustment of status is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report to the Congress; resolution not favoring adjustment of status; reduction of quota</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A complete and detailed statement of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the case shall be reported to the Congress with the reasons for such adjustment of status. Such reports shall be submitted on the first day of each calendar month in which Congress is in session. The Secretary of State shall, if the alien was classifiable as a quota immigrant at the time of his entry, reduce by one the quota of the quota area to which the alien is chargeable under section 1152 of this title for the fiscal year then current or the next following year in which a quota is available. No quota shall be so reduced by more than 50 per centum in any fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Period of time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No alien crewman shall be permitted to land temporarily in the United States except as provided in this section and sections 1182(d)(3), (5) and 1283 of this title. If an immigration officer finds upon examination that an alien crewman is a nonimmigrant under paragraph (15)(D) of section 1101(a) of this title and is otherwise admissible and has agreed to accept such permit, he may, in his discretion, grant the crewman a conditional permit to land temporarily pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, subject to revocation in subsequent proceedings as provided in subsection (b) of this section, and for a period of time, in any event, not to exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the period of time (not exceeding twenty-nine days) during which the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived remains in port, if the immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends to depart on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) twenty-nine days, if the immigration officer is satisfied that the crewman intends to depart, within the period for which he is permitted to land, on a vessel or aircraft other than the one on which he arrived.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Revocation; expenses of detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, any immigration officer may, in his discretion, if he determines that an alien is not a bona fide crewman, or does not intend to depart on the vessel or aircraft which brought him, revoke the conditional permit to land which was granted such crewman under the provisions of subsection (a)(1) of this section, take such crewman into custody, and require the master or commanding officer of the vessel or aircraft on which the crewman arrived to receive and detain him on board such vessel or aircraft, if practicable, and such crewman shall be deported from the United States at the expense of the transportation line which brought him to the United States. Until such alien is so deported, any expenses of his detention shall be borne by such transportation company. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the procedure prescribed in section 1252 of this title to cases falling within the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Penalties</h4>

No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance until such expenses are paid, or their payment appropriately guaranteed, and the collector of customs is so notified by the immigration officer in charge. An alien crewman suspected of being afflicted with any such disability or disease may be removed from the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived to an immigration station, or other appropriate place, for such observation as will enable the examining surgeons to determine definitely whether or not he is so afflicted, all expenses connected therewith to be borne in the manner hereinbefore prescribed. In cases in which it appears to the satisfaction of the immigration officer in charge that it will not be possible within a reasonable time to effect a cure, the return of the alien crewman shall be enforced on, or at the expense of, the transportation line on which he came, upon such conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to insure that the alien shall be properly cared for and protected, and that the spread of contagion shall be guarded against.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Penalties for failure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner, agent, consignee, charterer, master, or commanding officer of any vessel or aircraft arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof who fails (1) to detain on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft to detain at a place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline, any alien crewman employed thereon until an immigration officer has completely inspected such alien crewman, including a physical examination by the medical examiner, or (2) to detain any alien crewman on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft at a place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline, after such inspection unless a conditional permit to land temporarily has been granted such alien crewman under section 1282 of this title or unless an alien crewman has been permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5) or 1283 of this title for medical or hospital treatment, or (3) to deport such alien crewman if required to do so by an immigration officer, whether such deportation requirement is imposed before or after the crewman is permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5), 1282, or 1283 of this title, shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 for each alien crewman in respect to whom any such failure occurs. No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the liability to the payment of such fine, or while the fine remains unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of a sum sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner. The Attorney General may, upon application in writing therefor, mitigate such penalty to not less than $500 for each alien crewman in respect of whom such failure occurs, upon such terms as he shall think proper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prima facie evidence against transportation line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations issued by the Attorney General, proof that an alien crewman did not appear upon the outgoing manifest of the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived in the United States from any place outside thereof, or that he was reported by the master or commanding officer of such vessel or aircraft as a deserter, shall be prima facie evidence of a failure to detain or deport such alien crewman.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deportation on other than arriving vessel or aircraft; expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Attorney General finds that deportation of an alien crewman under this section on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived is impracticable or impossible, or would cause undue hardship to such alien crewman, he may cause the alien crewman to be deported from the port of arrival or any other port on another vessel or aircraft of the same transportation line, unless the Attorney General finds this to be impracticable. All expenses incurred in connection with such deportation, including expenses incurred in transferring an alien crewman from one place in the United States to another under such conditions and safeguards as the Attorney General shall impose, shall be paid by the owner or owners of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States. The vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived shall not be granted clearance until such expenses have been paid or their payment guaranteed to the satisfaction of the Attorney General. An alien crewman who is transferred within the United States in accordance with this subsection shall not be regarded as having been landed in the United States.</p>

If it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General, from an examination made by a medical officer of the United States Public Health Service, and is so certified by such officer, that any such alien was so afflicted at the time he was shipped or engaged and taken on board such vessel or aircraft and that the existence of such affliction might have been detected by means of a competent medical examination at such time, the owner, commanding officer, agent, consignee, or master thereof shall pay for each alien so afflicted to the Commissioner the sum of $1,000. No vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the question of the liability to the payment of such sums, or while such sums remain unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such sums or of a bond approved by the Commissioner with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title, the term &ldquo;normal operation and service on board a vessel&rdquo; does not include any activity that is longshore work (as defined in subsection (b) of this section), except as provided under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Longshore work&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this section, except as provided in paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;longshore work&rdquo; means any activity relating to the loading or unloading of cargo, the operation of cargo-related equipment (whether or not integral to the vessel), and the handling of mooring lines on the dock when the vessel is made fast or let go, in the United States or the coastal waters thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for safety and environmental protection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;longshore work&rdquo; does not include the loading or unloading of any cargo for which the Secretary of Transportation has, under the authority contained in chapter 37 of title 46 (relating to Carriage of Liquid Bulk Dangerous Cargoes), section 1321 of title 33, section 4106 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or section 5103(b), 5104, 5106, 5107, or 5110 of title 49 prescribed regulations which govern&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the handling or stowage of such cargo,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the manning of vessels and the duties, qualifications, and training of the officers and crew of vessels carrying such cargo, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the reduction or elimination of discharge during ballasting, tank cleaning, handling of such cargo.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as broadening, limiting, or otherwise modifying the meaning or scope of longshore work for purposes of any other law, collective bargaining agreement, or international agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prevailing practice exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a particular activity of longshore work in and about a local port if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) there is in effect in the local port one or more collective bargaining agreements each covering at least 30 percent of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore work and (ii) each such agreement (covering such percentage of longshore workers) permits the activity to be performed by alien crewmen under the terms of such agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in the local port covering at least 30 percent of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore work, and an employer of alien crewmen (or the employer's designated agent or representative) has filed with the Secretary of Labor at least 14 days before the date of performance of the activity (or later, if necessary due to an unanticipated emergency, but not later than the date of performance of the activity) an attestation setting forth facts and evidence to show that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the performance of the activity by alien crewmen is permitted under the prevailing practice of the particular port as of the date of filing of the attestation and that the use of alien crewmen for such activity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is not during a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is not intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the local port; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) notice of the attestation has been provided by the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer to the bargaining representative of longshore workers in the local port, or, where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the attesta<!-- PDFPage:197 -->tion has been provided to longshore workers employed at the local port.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In applying subparagraph (B) in the case of a particular activity of longshore work consisting of the use of an automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel, the attestation shall be required to be filed only if the Secretary of Labor finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence which may be submitted by any interested party, that the performance of such particular activity is not described in clause (i) of such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (4), an attestation under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) apply to aliens arriving in the United States during such 1-year period if the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer states in each list under section 1281 of this title that it continues to comply with the conditions in the attestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer may meet the requirements under this subsection with respect to more than one alien crewman in a single list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a list identifying owners, agents, consignees, masters, or commanding officers which have filed lists for nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title with respect to whom an attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this section is made and, for each such entity, a copy of the entity's attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this section (and accompanying documentation) and each such list filed by the entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting an entity's failure to meet conditions attested to, an entity's misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation, or, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), whether the performance of the particular activity is or is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the Secretary).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall promptly conduct an investigation under this subparagraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that an entity fails to meet conditions attested to, an entity has misrepresented a material fact in the attestation, or, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of the particular activity is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to an attestation, a complaining party may request that the activities attested to by the employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D). If such a request is made, the attesting employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to a matter under the last sentence of paragraph (1), a complaining party may request that the activities of the employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1). If such a request is made, the employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Under the process established under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date a complaint is filed (or later for good cause shown), for a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (E). The Secretary shall provide notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an entity has failed to meet a condition attested to or has made a misrepresentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each alien crewman performing unauthorized longshore work) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General shall not permit the vessels owned or chartered by such entity to enter any port of the United States during a period of up to 1 year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of the particular activity is not described in subparagraph (B)(i), the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and, thereafter, the attestation described in paragraph (1) shall be required of the employer for the performance of the particular activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) A finding by the Secretary of Labor under this paragraph that the performance of an activity by alien crewmen is not permitted under the prevailing practice of a local port shall preclude for one year the filing of a subsequent attestation concerning such activity in the port under paragraph (1).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:198 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of subsection (d) of this section, this subsection shall not apply to longshore work performed in the State of Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State of Alaska exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to a particular activity of longshore work at a particular location in the State of Alaska if an employer of alien crewmen has filed an attestation with the Secretary of Labor at least 30 days before the date of the first performance of the activity (or anytime up to 24 hours before the first performance of the activity, upon a showing that the employer could not have reasonably anticipated the need to file an attestation for that location at that time) setting forth facts and evidence to show that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) wherever two or more contract stevedoring companies have signed a joint collective bargaining agreement with a single labor organization described in subparagraph (D)(i), the employer may request longshore workers from only one of such contract stevedoring companies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a request for longshore workers to an operator of a private dock may be made only for longshore work to be performed at that dock and only if the operator meets the requirements of section 932 of title 33;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employer will employ all those United States longshore workers made available in response to the request made pursuant to subparagraph (A) who are qualified and available in sufficient numbers and who are needed to perform the longshore activity at the particular time and location;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the use of alien crewmembers for such activity is not intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the State of Alaska; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) labor organizations which have been recognized as exclusive bargaining representatives of United States longshore workers within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] and which make available or intend to make available workers to the particular location where the longshore work is to be performed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) contract stevedoring companies which employ or intend to employ United States longshore workers at that location, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) operators of private docks at which the employer will use longshore workers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An employer filing an attestation under paragraph (1) who seeks to use alien crewmen to perform longshore work shall be responsible while at&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1288_1_target" name="1288_1">1</a></sup> the attestation is valid to make bona fide requests for United States longshore workers under paragraph (1)(A) and to employ United States longshore workers, as provided in paragraph (1)(B), before using alien crewmen to perform the activity or activities specified in the attestation, except that an employer shall not be required to request longshore workers from a party if that party has notified the employer in writing that it does not intend to make available United States longshore workers to the location at which the longshore work is to be performed.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Persons liable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person, including any transportation company, or the owner, master, commanding officer, agent, charterer, or consignee of any vessel or aircraft, to bring to the United States from any place outside thereof (other than from foreign contiguous territory) any alien who does not have a valid passport and an unexpired visa, if a visa was required under this chapter or regulations issued thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that any alien has been so brought, such person, or transportation company, or the master, commanding officer, agent, owner, charterer, or consignee of any such vessel or aircraft, shall pay to the Commissioner a fine of $3,000 for each alien so brought and, except in the case of any such alien who is admitted, or permitted to land temporarily, in addition, an amount equal to that paid by such alien for his transportation from the initial point of departure, indicated in his ticket, to the port of arrival, such latter fine to be delivered by the Commissioner to the alien on whose account the assessment is made. No vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the liability to the payment of such fine or while such fine remain&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1323_1_target" name="1323_1">1</a></sup> unpaid, except that <!-- PDFPage:205 -->clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Remission or refund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, such fine shall not be remitted or refunded, unless it appears to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that such person, and the owner, master, commanding officer, agent, charterer, and consignee of the vessel or aircraft, prior to the departure of the vessel or aircraft from the last port outside the United States, did not know, and could not have ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that the individual transported was an alien and that a valid passport or visa was required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alien stowaways</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner, charterer, agent, consignee, commanding officer, or master of any vessel or aircraft arriving at the United States from any place outside the United States who fails to deport any alien stowaway on the vessel or aircraft on which such stowaway arrived or on another vessel or aircraft at the expense of the vessel or aircraft on which such stowaway arrived when required to do so by an immigration officer, shall pay to the Commissioner a fine of $3,000 for each alien stowaway, in respect of whom any such failure occurs. Pending final determination of liability for such fine, no such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance, except that clearance may be granted upon the deposit of an amount sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner. The provisions of section 1225 of this title for detention of aliens for examination before special inquiry officers and the right of appeal provided for in section 1226 of this title shall not apply to aliens who arrive as stowaways and no such alien shall be permitted to land in the United States, except temporarily for medical treatment, or pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe for the ultimate departure or removal or deportation of such alien from the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction, refund, or waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fine under this section may be reduced, refunded, or waived under such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe in cases in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the carrier demonstrates that it had screened all passengers on the vessel or aircraft in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Attorney General, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) circumstances exist that the Attorney General determines would justify such reduction, refund, or waiver.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) No authorization of national identification cards</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evaluation and changes in employment verification system</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Presidential monitoring and improvements in system</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President shall provide for the monitoring and evaluation of the degree to which the employment verification system established under subsection (b) of this section provides a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States and shall examine the suitability of existing Federal and State identification systems for use for this purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Improvements to establish secure system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that the system established under subsection (b) of this section is found not to be a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States, the President shall, subject to paragraph (3) and taking into account the results of any demonstration projects conducted under paragraph (4), implement such changes in (including additions to) the requirements of subsection (b) of this section as may be necessary to establish a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States. Such changes in the system may be implemented only if the changes conform to the requirements of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restrictions on changes in system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any change the President proposes to implement under paragraph (1) in the verification system must be designed in a manner so the verification system, as so changed, meets the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reliable determination of identity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The system must be capable of reliably determining whether&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the employee or prospective employee is claiming the identity of another individual.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Using of counterfeit-resistant documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the system requires that a document be presented to or examined by an employer, the document must be in a form which is resistant to counterfeiting and tampering.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limited use of system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any personal information utilized by the system may not be made available to Government agencies, employers, and other persons except to the extent necessary to verify that an individual is not an unauthorized alien.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Privacy of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The system must protect the privacy and security of personal information and identifiers utilized in the system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Limited denial of verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A verification that an employee or prospective employee is eligible to be employed in the United States may not be withheld or revoked under the system for any reason other than that the employee or prospective employee is an unauthorized alien.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Limited use for law enforcement purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The system may not be used for law enforcement purposes, other than for enforcement of this chapter or sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Restriction on use of new documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the system requires individuals to present a new card or other document (designed specifically for use for this purpose) at the time of hiring, recruitment, or referral, then such document may not be required to be presented for any purpose other than under this chapter (or enforcement of sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of title 18) nor to be carried on one's person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice to Congress before implementing changes</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) one year, in the case of a major change described in subparagraph (D)(iii), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) two years, in the case of a major change described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (D),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">before the date of implementation of the change, the President has prepared and transmitted to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a written report setting forth the proposed change. If the President proposes to make any change regarding social security account number cards, the President shall transmit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance of the Senate a written report setting forth the proposed change. The President promptly shall cause to have printed in the Federal Register the <!-- PDFPage:211 -->substance of any major change (described in subparagraph (D)) proposed and reported to Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents of report</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall cause to have printed in the Congressional Record the substance of any major change described in subparagraph (D), shall hold hearings respecting the feasibility and desirability of implementing such a change, and, within the two year period before implementation, shall report to their respective Houses findings on whether or not such a change should be implemented.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Congressional action</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12989. Economy and Efficiency in Government Procurement Through Compliance With Certain Immigration and Naturalization Act Provisions</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12989, Feb. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 6091, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. Stability and dependability are important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose work force is less stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose work force is more stable. It remains the policy of this Administration to enforce the immigration laws to the fullest extent, including the detection and deportation of illegal aliens. In these circumstances, contractors cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of illegal aliens, and contractors that choose to employ unauthorized aliens inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable work force than contractors that do not employ such persons. Because of this Administration's vigorous enforcement policy, contractors that employ unauthorized alien workers are necessarily less stable and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not hire such persons. I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of not contracting with providers that knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies should not contract with employers that have not complied with section 274A(a)(1)(A) and 274A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A), 1324a(a)(2)) (the &ldquo;INA employment provisions&rdquo;) prohibiting the unlawful employment of aliens. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It remains the policy of this Administration to fully and aggressively enforce the antidiscrimination provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.] to the fullest extent. Nothing in this order relieves employers from their obligation to avoid unfair immigration-related employment practices as required by the antidiscrimination provisions of section 1324(b) [274B] of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324b) and all other antidiscrimination requirements of applicable law, including the requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(6) concerning the treatment of certain documentary practices as unfair immigration-related employment practices.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. Contractor, as used in this Executive order, shall have the same meaning as defined in subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. Using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Attorney General: (a) may investigate to determine whether a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 3(a) of this order where such complaints allege noncompliance with the INA employment provisions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) shall hold such hearings as are required under 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e) to determine whether an entity covered under section 3(a) is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) Whenever the Attorney General determines that a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions, the Attorney General shall transmit that determination to the appropriate contracting agency and such other Federal agencies as the Attorney General may determine. Upon receipt of such determination from the Attorney General, the head of the appropriate contracting agency shall consider the contractor or an organizational unit thereof for debarment as well as for such other action as may be appropriate in accordance with the procedures and standards prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of the contracting agency may debar the contractor or an organizational unit thereof based on the determination of the Attorney General that it is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions. The Attorney General's determination shall not be reviewable in the debarment proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The scope of the debarment generally should be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Attorney General finds are not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year and may be extended for additional periods of 1 year if, using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Attorney General determines that the organizational unit of the Federal contractor continues to be in violation of the INA employment provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Administrator of General Services shall list a debarred contractor or an organizational unit thereof on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs and the contractor or an organizational unit thereof shall be ineligible <!-- PDFPage:218 -->to participate in any procurement or nonprocurement activities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) The Attorney General shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order, except for the debarment procedures. The Attorney General may adopt such additional rules and regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the Attorney General under this order. If the Attorney General proposes to issue rules, regulations, or orders that affect the contracting departments and agencies, the Attorney General shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, and such other agencies as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to the extent necessary and appropriate to implement the debarment responsibility and other related responsibilities assigned to heads of contracting departments and agencies under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with and provide such information and assistance to the Attorney General as may be required in the performance of the Attorney General's functions under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the heads of contracting departments and agencies may delegate any of their functions or duties under this order to any officer or employee of their respective agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. This order shall be implemented in a manner intended to least burden the procurement process. This order neither authorizes nor requires any additional certification provision, clause, or requirement to be included in any contract or contract solicitation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition of discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to discriminate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien, as defined in section 1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to the hiring, or recruitment or referral for a fee, of the individual for employment or the discharging of the individual from employment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) because of such individual's national origin, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a protected individual (as defined in paragraph (3)), because of such individual's citizenship status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a person or other entity that employs three or fewer employees,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a person's or entity's discrimination because of an individual's national origin if the discrimination with respect to that person or entity and that individual is covered under section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e&ndash;2], or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) discrimination because of citizenship status which is otherwise required in order to comply with law, regulation, or executive order, or required by Federal, State, or local government contract, or which the Attorney General determines to be essential for an employer to do business with an agency or department of the Federal, State, or local government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Protected individual&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;protected individual&rdquo; means an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is a citizen or national of the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence, is granted the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under section 1160(a), 1161(a),<sup><a href="#1324b_1_target" name="1324b_1">1</a></sup> or 1255a(a)(1) of this title, is admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or is granted asylum under section 1158 of this title; but does not include (i) an alien who fails to apply for naturalization within six months of the date the alien first becomes eligible (by virtue of period of lawful permanent residence) to apply for naturalization or, if later, within six months after November 6, 1986, and (ii) an alien who has applied on a timely basis, but has not been naturalized as a citizen within 2 years after the date of the application, unless the alien can establish that the alien is actively pursuing naturalization, except that time consumed in the Service's processing the application shall not be counted toward the 2-year period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional exception providing right to prefer equally qualified citizens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it is not an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to prefer to hire, recruit, or refer an individual who is a citizen or national of the United States over another individual who is an alien if the two individuals are equally qualified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Prohibition of intimidation or retaliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is also an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to intimidate, threaten, coerce, or retaliate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured under this section or because the individual intends to file or has filed a charge or a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this section. An individual so intimidated, threatened, coerced, or retaliated against shall be considered, for purposes of <!-- PDFPage:219 -->subsections (d) and (g) of this section, to have been discriminated against.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of certain documentary practices as employment practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a person's or other entity's request, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 1324a(b) of this title, for more or different documents than are required under such section or refusing to honor documents tendered that on their face reasonably appear to be genuine shall be treated as an unfair immigration-related employment practice relating to the hiring of individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charges of violations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person alleging that the person is adversely affected directly by an unfair immigration-related employment practice (or a person on that person's behalf) or an officer of the Service alleging that an unfair immigration-related employment practice has occurred or is occurring may file a charge respecting such practice or violation with the Special Counsel (appointed under subsection (c) of this section). Charges shall be in writing under oath or affirmation and shall contain such information as the Attorney General requires.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Persons making extraordinary contributions to national security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Immigration determine that an applicant otherwise eligible for naturalization has made an extraordinary contribution to the national security of the United States or to the conduct of United States intelligence activities, the applicant may be naturalized without regard to the residence and physical presence requirements of this section, or to the prohibitions of section 1424 of this title, and no residence within a particular State or district of the Service in the United States shall be required: <em>Provided</em>, That the applicant has continuously resided in the United States for at least one year prior to naturalization: <em>Provided further</em>, That the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any alien described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of section 1253(h)(2) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public ceremony</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person who has applied for naturalization shall, in order to be and before being admitted to citizenship, take in a public ceremony before the Attorney General or a court with jurisdiction under section 1421(b) of this title an oath (1) to support the Constitution of the United States; (2) to renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which the applicant was before a subject or citizen; (3) to support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; (4) to bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and (5)(A) to bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law, or (B) to perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law, or (C) to perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law. Any such person shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of clauses (1) to (5) of the preceding sentence, except that a person who shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is opposed to the bearing of arms in the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious training and belief shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of clauses (1) to (4) and clauses (5)(B) and (5)(C) of this subsection, and a person who shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is opposed to any type of service in the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious training and belief shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of said clauses (1) to (4) and clause (5)(C). The term &ldquo;religious training and belief&rdquo; as used in this section shall mean an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code. In the case of the naturalization of a child under the provisions of section 1433 of this title the Attorney General may waive the taking of the oath if in the opinion of the Attorney General the child is unable to understand its meaning.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:272 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hereditary titles or orders of nobility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case the person applying for naturalization has borne any hereditary title, or has been of any of the orders of nobility in any foreign state, the applicant shall in addition to complying with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, make under oath in the same public ceremony in which the oath of allegiance is administered, an express renunciation of such title or order of nobility, and such renunciation shall be recorded as a part of such proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Expedited judicial oath administration ceremony</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1421(b) of this title, an individual may be granted an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony or administrative naturalization by the Attorney General upon demonstrating sufficient cause. In determining whether to grant an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony, a court shall consider special circumstances (such as serious illness of the applicant or a member of the applicant's immediate family, permanent disability sufficiently incapacitating as to prevent the applicant's personal appearance at the scheduled ceremony, developmental disability or advanced age, or exigent circumstances relating to travel or employment). If an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony is impracticable, the court shall refer such individual to the Attorney General who may provide for immediate administrative naturalization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall prescribe rules and procedures to ensure that the ceremonies conducted by the Attorney General for the administration of oaths of allegiance under this section are public, conducted frequently and at regular intervals, and are in keeping with the dignity of the occasion.</p>

Any person who claims United States citizenship through the naturalization of a parent or spouse in whose case there is a revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, or under the provisions of section 1440(c) of this title on any ground other than that the order and certificate of naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, shall be deemed to have lost and to lose his citizenship and any right or privilege of citizenship which would have been enjoyed by such person had there not been a revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization, unless such person is residing in the United States at the time of the revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Citizenship unlawfully procured</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a person shall be convicted under section 1425 of title 18 of knowingly procuring naturalization in violation of law, the court in which such conviction is had shall thereupon revoke, set aside, and declare void the final order admitting such person to citizenship, and shall declare the certificate of naturalization of such person to be canceled. Jurisdiction is conferred on the courts having jurisdiction of the trial of such offense to make such adjudication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Cancellation of certificate of naturalization</h4>

The Secretary may permit alternative projects to cover specific groups of refugees who have been in the United States 36 months or longer if the Secretary determines that refugees in the group have been significantly and disproportionately dependent on welfare and need the services provided under the project in order to become self-sufficient and that their coverage under the projects would be cost-effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be precluded from receiving cash or medical assistance under any other paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 601 et seq.].</p>
