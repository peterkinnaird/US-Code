<p class="note-body">Section 2101(1) defines the type of &ldquo;associated equipment&rdquo; that is involved in the use of recreational boats that are subject to Federal regulatory authority. This equipment is subject to a number of controls under federally established construction and performance standards. Radio equipment is exempt from these regulatory controls, since this equipment continues to be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(2) defines &ldquo;barge&rdquo; as a vessel that is non-self-propelled and that is often pushed ahead, towed alongside, or towed astern on a hawser by a towing vessel. It does not include a vessel that is propelled by sail only.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(3) defines &ldquo;boundary line&rdquo; for the establishment of jurisdictional parameters for various maritime safety laws. Public Law 96&ndash;324, codified at 33 U.S.C. 151, permits the Secretary to establish appropriate identifiable lines dividing inland waters of the U.S. from the high seas for the purpose of determining the applicability of these laws. These laws will now be included within subtitle II of title 46&mdash;Shipping. These lines may not be located more than twelve nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured and may differ in position for the purposes of different parts or sections of subtitle II.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(4) defines &ldquo;Coast Guard&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(5) provides that wherever the term &ldquo;commercial service&rdquo; is used it is to include all vessels except those that are primarily used for combatant purposes. This is to make sure that vessels that are engaged in the transportation of goods or individuals are subject to the applicable maritime and environmental safety laws, even if they are sovereign controlled vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(6) defines &ldquo;consular officer&rdquo; as one who has authority to issue visas. Traditionally this person is knowledgeable and familiar with the maritime safety and seamen's welfare laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(7) defines &ldquo;crude oil&rdquo; because certain equipment requirements like inert gas systems, segregated ballast tanks, crude oil washing systems or special ballast arrangements are applicable only to tank vessels that carry crude oil. Crude oil is still included within the definition of &ldquo;hazardous material&rdquo; and &ldquo;oil&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(8) defines a &ldquo;crude oil tanker&rdquo; as one engaged in carrying crude oil. The definition does not include a tank barge since a tanker is defined as a self-propelled tank vessel. See also 2101(38).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(9) makes it clear that the term &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; when referring to a substance that emanates from a vessel and is related to the marine environmental laws concerning pollution by oil or hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(10) defines a &ldquo;documented vessel&rdquo; as any vessel of the United States that has been issued a certificate of documentation that might include a register, enrollment, license, or enrollment and license for various trades.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(11) lists what is included in the term &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo; for the purpose of documentation of vessels and is intended to be all-inclusive of the numerous types of fishing activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(12) defines &ldquo;foreign vessel&rdquo; as any foreign flag or foreign operated vessel that is operated under the jurisdiction or authority of a government other than the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(13) defines a &ldquo;freight vessel&rdquo; as a motor vessel or any vessel propelled by diesel or other internal combustion engines and that carries freight for hire.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(14) defines &ldquo;hazardous materials&rdquo; as a broad range of materials that are not only flammable or combustible but are also designated under related maritime safety and environmental laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(15) defines &ldquo;marine environment&rdquo; as an all-inclusive term that was developed to cover land and water areas that could be affected by pollution from all vessels and not only tank vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(16) defines &ldquo;motor vessel&rdquo; as a vessel propelled by machinery other than steam to make it clear that these vessels are not steam vessels.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:12 --><p class="note-body">Section 2101(17) defines &ldquo;nautical school vessel&rdquo; as a vessel that can be a privately owned and operated as well as a publicly owned and operated school vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(18) defines &ldquo;oceanographic research vessel&rdquo; as a vessel employed in oceanography or limnology research or instruction. It is defined because this type of vessel, while not inspected and certified as such, is subject to a number of special statutory and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(19) defines &ldquo;offshore supply vessel&rdquo; as a class of vessel that is limited by tonnage and its employment in the mineral and oil industry and while so employed it is not a small passenger vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(20) defines &ldquo;oil&rdquo; to include oil of any type, in any form, or in any mixture. This is the definition that originated with marine environment and pollution laws and continues the definition that was adopted by port and tanker safety laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(21) defines the term &ldquo;passengers&rdquo; in relation to various types of vessels. Due to the complexity of existing laws with respect to the definitions of &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; on various categories of vessels and the need to not make any changes of a substantive nature that could be construed as controversial, four definitions of &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; have been included.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(22) defines &ldquo;passenger vessel&rdquo; as one that is at least 100 gross tons and carries at least one passenger for hire.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(23) defines &ldquo;product carrier&rdquo; as a tanker that is engaged in carrying oil. This definition when read with the definition of tanker means that it is a self-propelled vessel. A tank barge carrying oil products is a tank vessel but is not subject to the special standards or requirements for a product carrier.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(24) defines a &ldquo;public vessel&rdquo; as a governmental vessel that is not in commercial service. It should be noted that a sovereign-controlled foreign-flag vessel that is engaged in commercial service is not a public vessel and is subject to maritime safety and environment laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(25) defines a &ldquo;recreational vessel&rdquo; as a class of vessel whose primary purpose is for pleasure. These vessels while not subject to inspection are subject to certain requirements of law to improve boating safety.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(26) defines a &ldquo;recreational vessel manufacturer&rdquo; as one that is involved with not only the recreational vessels themselves but also with their components or associated equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(27), (28), (29), and (30) provides a number of definitions that define the type of instruction, instructor, student, and vessel that is involved in the teaching of sailing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(31) defines &ldquo;scientific personnel&rdquo; as individuals engaged in oceanography or limnology because they are specially treated under various maritime safety requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(32) defines a &ldquo;seagoing barge&rdquo; as a vessel that is at least 100 gross tons making voyages to sea beyond the boundary line.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(33) defines a &ldquo;seagoing motor vessel&rdquo; as a vessel that must be a motor vessel, as defined in 2101(15), of at least 300 gross tons making voyages to sea beyond the boundary line.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(34) defines &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; so that maritime safety and seamen's welfare jurisdiction remains within the Coast Guard at all times.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(35) defines &ldquo;small passenger vessel&rdquo; as one that is less than 100 gross tons carrying more than six passengers as defined in section 2101(21).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(36) defines &ldquo;State&rdquo; as a State, territory or possession of the United States and is used to establish jurisdictional limits for the application of the various maritime safety and environmental safety laws of this subtitle. This definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102 that relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(37) defines a &ldquo;steam vessel&rdquo; as a vessel propelled by steam. However, steam vessels of not more than 40 feet that are used exclusively for pleasure are not included.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(38) defines &ldquo;tanker&rdquo; as a self-propelled tank vessel that has been constructed or primarily adapted to carry oil or hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces. This vessel is a subclass of tank vessel, which is defined in section 2101(39). This subclass definition is necessary because certain statutory minimum requirements that are consistent with internationally accepted standards are solely applicable to these vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(39) defines a &ldquo;tank vessel&rdquo; as a vessel carrying oil or hazardous materials in bulk or residue including a tanker as defined in section 2101(38).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(40) defines &ldquo;towing vessel&rdquo; as a vessel in commercial service that pushes, pulls, or tows alongside and includes what is traditionally known as a tug.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(41) defines &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; which, in part, facilitates the classification of vessels that may be numbered by the proper issuing authority in a State.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(42) defines an &ldquo;uninspected passenger vessel&rdquo; as a vessel carrying six or less passengers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(43) defines an &ldquo;uninspected vessel&rdquo; as a vessel not subject to inspection and certification by the Coast Guard under section 3301. Recreational vessels and inland towing vessels are typical uninspected vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(44) defines &ldquo;United States&rdquo; to establish geographical boundaries for the applicability of the various maritime safety and environmental safety laws of this subtitle. This definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102 that relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(45) makes it clear that &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; as used in this subtitle has the same meaning as is provided in section 3 of title 1, of the U.S.C.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2101(46) defines &ldquo;vessel of the United States&rdquo; as a vessel that is documented or numbered under the laws of the United States. A documented vessel and those vessels that are numbered by a State or Federal authority are afforded the protection of the laws of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 2107 provides for standard procedures for the handling of civil penalties for infractions of law or regulation. Some changes were made to increase some antiquated and inadequate penalties.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assessment of civil penalties under this section should not require an &ldquo;on the record&rdquo; hearing within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). It is intended that these civil penalties be assessed in a fair manner. However, the Committee recognizes that statutes passed in the last decade have involved the Coast Guard in tens of thousands of civil penalty enforcement cases and that it is necessary that the penalties be assessed efficiently. The Coast Guard's procedural regulations for assessing civil penalties ensure that the essential elements of due process, notice, and opportunity to be heard, are provided to alleged violators (see 33 CFR Subpart 1.07). The more rigid and time-consuming procedures applicable to APA adjudications are unwarranted in the case of Coast Guard civil penalty assessment procedures and would seriously hamper the orderly enforcement of these administrative penalties.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 2302 states that the negligent operation of a vessel is prohibited. These acts are subject to civil and criminal penalties and the involved vessel is subject to an in rem action. The negligent operation provisions have their genesis in the Act of April 25, 1940, 54 Stat. 167, when Congress prescribed that no person shall operate any motorboat or <em>any vessel</em> in a reckless or negligent manner. This provision was directed at all vessels and not those solely engaged in recreational boating. When the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, P.L. 92&ndash;75, 85 Stat. 217 (46 U.S.C. 1461) was enacted it adopted the reckless or negligent operation provisions of the 1940 Act. It adopted for the first time a provision for assessing civil penalties in addition to criminal penalties. It dropped the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; because of redundancy. It also combined the two classes of vessels; &ldquo;any motorboat or any vessel&rdquo; into one class by using the word &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; and defined vessel as including every description of watercraft.</p>

This part specifies those vessels subject to inspection, those that are specifically exempt from inspection, and related inspection requirements and procedures. Due to the need for special requirements for the inspection and regulation of passenger vessels and those vessels carrying liquid bulk dangerous cargoes separate chapters have been developed. Additional chapters provide for recreational vessels and those other vessels that are regulated but are not subject to <!-- PDFPage:22 -->inspection and certification by the Coast Guard. It should also be noted that the United States is signatory to a number of international treaties on maritime safety and seamen's welfare, such as the various Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) treaties, and that their provisions and requirements are part of United States maritime law and in many cases are quite extensive.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Chapter 33 consolidates the laws governing the inspection and certification of vessels by the Coast Guard that have developed over a period in excess of 140 years. The original laws were directed to the safety of the relatively new and potentially dangerous steam vessel. The demand for Federal remedial legislation began during the early 1800's after frequent and disastrous explosions of steam boilers on passenger vessels. This directly led to the first maritime safety laws in 1838 that required periodic inspection and certification of vessels engaged in the transportation of passengers and freight on the waters of the United States. This was followed by a more extensive steamboat inspection law in 1852 which adopted for the first time the principle of licensing for river pilots and engineers. It also created a new Federal maritime safety inspection service called the Federal Inspection Service that eventually became the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, whose duties were temporarily assumed in 1941 and permanently assumed in 1946 by the United States Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="note-body">In 1864 the principal inspection and licensing provisions of the 1852 act were made applicable to ferries, towing vessels, and canal boats. However, steamboat explosions continued with high loss of life and property. One of the greatest of all disasters, the destruction of the passenger vessel <em>Sultana</em> by explosion and fire with a loss of life estimated at more than 1500 lives in April 1865, led to renewed legislation efforts. In 1871 this culminated with legislation that combined a number of new requirements into a coherent and unified body of maritime safety laws. At the time of the adoption of the Revised Statutes in 1874, a maritime safety code was well established for vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the more than 100 years since then, as the public recognized the need for vessel safety legislation, primarily as the result of maritime disasters, other classes of vessels were subjected to Federal inspection or regulatory control. These included vessels propelled by gas, fluid, naphtha, or electric motors in 1897; sail vessels and barges carrying passengers for hire in 1898; seagoing barges in 1908; motorboats in 1910; steam vessels owned by the Department of Commerce in 1919; seagoing vessels of 300 gross tons and over on June 20, 1936; all tank vessels carrying flammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk regardless of size or means of propulsion of June 23, 1936; motorboats again in 1940; all vessels carrying more than six passengers in 1956; tank vessels again in 1978; and offshore supply vessels in 1980. There was also considerable legislation that amended or supplemented these primary maritime safety laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">The net result has been a patchwork quilt of categories and classifications that requires a tabulation of more than seventy different classes of inspected vessels. This revision gathers into one section of the law all classes of vessels that are subject to inspection and certification without changing the application of present law as to any one class of vessel. The revision does not alter the application of the present law so as to expand inspection requirements to any vessel presently not subject to inspection nor to remove from inspection any vessel that is presently subject to inspection.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 3301 lists all classes of vessels that are subject to inspection and certification by the Coast Guard. This section represents one of the sought-after advantages of the bill to simplify access to the provisions of law governing the regulation of vessels. Under the present law, a vessel's inspection status must be determined by examining a table appearing at section 2.01&ndash;7A of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations that divides all vessels into more than 70 separate classes.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is important to note that while the classes of vessels are now limited to ten, there is no prohibition <!-- PDFPage:24 -->against developing regulations to meet the special needs of various size vessels within any one category. For example, it is expected that the Coast Guard will continue the practice of establishing standards for freight vessels of not more than 100 gross tons and other standards for larger freight vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">It should also be noted that a particular vessel can, when engaged in various types of operations, be subject to varying inspection laws. For example, an offshore supply vessel could be classed as a small passenger vessel or a passenger vessel when it operates as a crew boat carrying individuals other than those defined in section 2101(21). If the offshore supply vessel is 500 gross tons and over it would then be subject to inspection as a seagoing motor vessel, a freight vessel, or a passenger vessel.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 3302 does three things. It makes clear that a vessel included in one of the ten categories of vessels subject to inspection is not necessarily excluded from another category of vessel that is subject to inspection. For example, a vessel inspected and certified as a small passenger vessel would, when carrying oil or hazardous materials in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, also have to be inspected as a tank vessel. It makes it clear that a vessel excluded by section 3302 from the requirements of inspection in any one of the ten categories is not necessarily excluded from inspection as a vessel in another category. This section also contains a number of exemptions for certain classes of vessels and for those vessels engaged in a specific trade that have been considered to be of a special circumstance.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 3305 consolidates, at one place, the basic scope of coverage of the inspection process. It is to be noted that the time difference in enactment of various statutes has resulted in some anomalies. Thus, for example, R.S. 4417 (46 U.S.C. 391) which had originally set periods of inspection and vested authority in &ldquo;local inspectors&rdquo; was expanded over the years to provide the base for inspection of certain classes of vessels as well as setting out the periods and scope. The distillation of inspection objectives and standards in later laws and the transfer of all functions of separately created bureaus and functionaries to the Coast Guard permit this consolidation. There are those who have a desire to see <!-- PDFPage:28 -->the scope and standards of inspection be more specific in law similar to those presently applicable to boilers and boiler plating that predate 1871. The Committee believes this serves no useful purpose since the specifics are either antiquated or too limiting and have, in fact, been superceded by the statutorily authorized adoption of various industrial specifications, standards, and codes by the Coast Guard. These include the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), American Welding Society (AWS), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and many others. In addition, Coast Guard regulations must also implement and conform to the numerous international maritime safety treaties to which the United States is signatory. The Committee expects that the regulatory flexibility being provided will not reduce the present vessel inspection requirements that have been historically developed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 3305(a) establishes the statutory scope of the Coast Guard's vessel inspection authority and duty. The inspection process shall ensure that a vessel is of suitable structure, equipment, and accommodations, is maintained in an operating condition consistent with safety of life and property, and complies with applicable marine safety laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) requires that defective life preservers and firehose be destroyed in the presence of the inspecting official, normally a qualified Coast Guard marine inspector. The Committee believes that if this equipment is defective for use on an inspected vessel, it should be destroyed so that it cannot be used on an uninspected or recreational vessel.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 3306 contains broad authority to prescribe regulations for the proper inspection and certification of vessels. It provides regulatory flexibility for meeting technological changes. The section also permits flexibility in prescribing regulations for nautical school vessels operated by the United States Merchant Marine Academy or by a State maritime academy. The Secretary may suspend or grant exemptions to certain limited inspection requirements when the Secretary finds that this is necessary in the public interest. It also contains the requirement that in regulating offshore supply vessels consideration must be given to the special nature of their operations.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 3307 requires each vessel subject to inspection to undergo an initial inspection prior to being placed in service. This is normally started during the construction or reconstruction phase and is a continuing process until final certification for operation in a particular trade. Subsequent periodic inspections are also required for various types of vessels. It is to be noted that a freight vessel of less than 100 gross tons shall be inspected at 3 year intervals while the larger freight vessel has a 2 year inspection period. This is being done to retain the existing procedure of issuing 3 year certificates of inspection to smaller vessels, however, this does not prevent periodic inspections or examinations at intervening periods.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 3316 prescribes the relationship between certain classification societies and the Federal Government with respect to the promotion of maritime safety and the security of life and property at sea. Briefly stated, a classification society, like the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), establishes and administers standards for the design, construction, and periodic survey of commercial vessels, yachts, and other marine structures. Classification certifies adherence to these standards, thus representing that a vessel or structure possesses the structural and mechanical fitness required for its intended service.</p>
<p class="note-body">The section requires that a Federal department, agency, or instrumentality recognize the American Bureau of Shipping as its agent for classing vessels owned by the Federal Government and in any matters related to classification. In effect, the ABS has a statutory monopoly on classing vessels of the United States Government. Additionally, the section contains the authority to permit the Secretary to rely on reports, documents, and certificates issued by a classification society that is similar to the American Bureau of Shipping. However, a &ldquo;similar classification society&rdquo; continues to mean one that is organized like the American Bureau of Shipping with attendant governmental representation.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Chapter 37 consolidates the laws that are applicable to vessels that transport oil or hazardous material in bulk as cargo or cargo residue.</p>
<p class="note-body">The history of Federal authority to carry out a tank vessel safety program begins with the enactment of the so-called Tank Vessel Act of 1936 which, as amended, is presently codified in section 391a of title 46, United States Code. The 1936 Act remained essentially the same until it was amended by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. The 1972 amendment contained more specific standards for the protection of a tank vessel and its crew and added vessel standards to improve the quality of the marine environment. After a rash of tank vessel accidents during the latter part of 1976 and early 1977 within our territorial seas and in nearby coastal waters, there was an outpouring of public attention to the need to protect United States ports and waterways, for the safety of tank vessels, and for the protection of the marine environment. This led to the enactment of the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978, which provided broader and more extensive regulatory authority over areas already regulated and over many areas not previously regulated. It provided for improvements in the supervision and control of vessels of all types operating in the navigable waters of the United States, and in the safety of all tank vessels, foreign or domestic, that transport or transfer oil or hazardous cargoes in ports or places subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The 1978 amendments also reflect, in part, certain tank vessel standards and requirements that have been accepted internationally, in particular those developed by the International Conference on Tanker Safety and Pollution Prevention held in London in February, 1978.</p>

The Secretary may also contract for inspections or examinations in the United States and in foreign countries.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 3715 requires the Secretary to control lightering operations; that is, the transferring of cargoes at sea from large deep-draft vessels to shallow-draft vessels for subsequent transfer to shoreside terminals due to the inability of the larger tank vessels to enter shallow ports. It prohibits a tank vessel from unloading any cargo of oil or hazardous material at any port or terminal under the jurisdiction of the United States, unless the cargo has been transferred in accordance with lightering regulations. It also prohibits the shoreside transfer unless both the delivering and receiving vessels involved in the prior lightering had on board at the time of the offshore transfer, the certificates that would have been required had the transfer taken place in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">The regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary shall include a number of specific considerations but may include any related matters deemed necessary to promote navigation and vessel safety and protection of the marine environment. The Secretary must consider standards for minimum safe operating conditions, including sea state, wave height, weather, vessel traffic, the prevention of oil spills, and oil spill response equipment. In regulating this operation, there must not be any unreasonable interference with international navigation or reasonable uses of the high seas, and there must be established lightering zones with attendant communications and prearrival message requirements.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Chapter 41 applies to vessels that are not subject to inspection and certification under chapter 33.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal authority to regulate uninspected vessels originated with the Motorboat Act of 1910 (Public Law 61&ndash;201, 36 Stat. 462) when Congress established standards with respect to navigation lights, machinery requirements, life preservers, and for the licensing of operators on small vessels carrying passengers. This was an extension of Federal regulatory authority over certain non-steam-propelled vessels, that is, those recreational vessels and commercial vessels that are propelled by machinery other than steam.</p>
<p class="note-body">Thirty years later, the 1910 Act was amended by the Motorboat Act of 1940 (Public Law 76&ndash;484, 54 Stat. 163), which added to the equipment that was required and provided for other regulatory controls. In this manner the Federal Government continued to exercise some degree of maritime safety supervision over the commercial and recreational vessel sector that was &ldquo;uninspected&rdquo;. This was important because steam towing vessels were coverting to diesel propulsion and were therefore no longer subject to the detailed periodic and extensive hull, machinery, and equipment inspections of a Federal agency. In addition, the number of recreational vessels primarily propelled by gasoline were increasing and were also suffering casualties from explosions and fires.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Chapter 43 contains the laws applicable to recreational vessels, which originated primarily with the enactment of the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 (Public Law 92&ndash;75, 85 Stat. 213). That Act embraced a number of activities, but the portion restated in this chapter deals with the establishment of national construction and performance standards for recreational vessels and their associated equipment, the necessary flexible regulatory authority for inspection and testing, Federal preemption, certain necessary prohibited acts, enforcement authority, investigation and reporting requirements, procedures for repair and defect notification, and attendant penalties and injunctive relief. These laws are a direct response to the dramatic increase in the number of recreational boats and the Congressional recognition of the maritime safety problems that recreational boating has imposed upon our more than 25 million miles of waterways.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each regulation prescribed under this section shall specify an effective date that is not earlier than 180 days from the date the regulation was published, unless the Secretary finds that there exists a recreational vessel safety hazard so critical as to require an earlier effective date. However, this period may not be more than 24 months for cases involving, in the discretion of the Secretary, major product design, retooling, or major changes in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In prescribing regulations under this section, the Secretary shall, among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider the need for and the extent to which the regulations will contribute to recreational vessel safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consider relevant available recreational vessel safety standards, statistics, and data, including public and private research, development, testing, and evaluation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) not compel substantial alteration of a recreational vessel or item of associated equipment that is in existence, or the construction or manufacture of which is begun before the effective date of the regulation, but subject to that limitation may require compliance or performance, to avoid a substantial risk of personal injury to the public, that the Secretary considers appropriate in relation to the degree of hazard that the compliance will correct; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consult with the National Boating Safety Advisory Council established under section 13110 of this title about the considerations referred to in clauses (1)&ndash;(3) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Section 8903 of this title does not apply to a vessel being operated for bona fide dealer dem<!-- PDFPage:50 -->onstrations provided without fee to business invitees. However, if on the basis of substantial evidence, the Secretary decides under this section that requiring vessels so operated to be under the control of licensed individuals is necessary for boating safety, then the Secretary may prescribe regulations requiring the licensing of individuals controlling these vessels in the same manner as provided in chapter 89 of this title for individuals in control of vessels carrying passengers for hire.</p>

It also provides for the display of seals and other devices for certifying or evidencing compliance with applicable safety regulations or standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 4302(b) requires a regulation prescribed under this section to have an effective date that is not earlier than 180 days from publication. However, in those instances where a safety hazard may be critical an earlier effective date is authorized.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 4302(c) requires the Secretary to consider certain objectives in developing regulatory controls and regulations or standards and that there must be an effective consultation process.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 4302(d) exempts dealer demonstration boats from the requirement of having to be named by a licensed individual when demonstrating boats to prospective purchasers or other business invitees when no fees are charged.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A person willfully operating a recreational vessel in violation of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter shall be fined not more than $5,000, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A person violating section 4307(a)(1) of this title is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not more than $2,000, except that the maximum civil penalty may be not more than $100,000 for a related series of violations. When a corporation violates section 4307(a)(1), any director, officer, or executive employee of the corporation who knowingly and willfully ordered, or knowingly and willfully authorized, a violation is individually liable to the Government for the penalty, in addition to the corporation. However, the director, officer, or executive employee is not liable individually under this subsection if the director, officer, or executive employee can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the order or authorization was issued on the basis of a decision, in exercising reasonable and prudent judgment, that the defect or the nonconformity with standards and regulations constituting the violation would not cause or constitute a substantial risk of personal injury to the public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at the time of the order or authorization, the director, officer, or executive employee advised the Secretary in writing of acting under this clause and clause (1) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A person violating any other provision of this chapter or other regulation prescribed under this chapter is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of not more than $1,000. If the violation involves the operation of a vessel, the vessel also is liable in rem for the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When a civil penalty of not more than $200 has been assessed under this chapter, the Secretary may refer the matter of collection of the penalty directly to the United States magistrate of the jurisdiction in which the person liable may be found for collection procedures under supervision of the district court and under an order issued by the court delegating this authority under section 636(b) of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to restrain a violation of this chapter, or to restrain the sale, offer for sale, introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce, or importation into the United States, of a recreational vessel or associated equipment that the court decides does not conform to safety standards of the Government. A civil action under this subsection shall be brought by filing a petition by the Attorney General for the Government. When practicable, the Secretary shall give notice to a person against whom an action for injunctive relief is contemplated and provide the person with an opportunity to present views and, except for a knowing and willful violation, shall provide the person with a reasonable opportunity to achieve compliance. The failure to give notice and provide the opportunity does not preclude the granting of appropriate relief by the district court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A person is not subject to a penalty under this chapter if the person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establishes that the person did not have reason to know, in exercising reasonable care, that a recreational vessel or associated equipment does not conform with the applicable safety standards of the Government or that the person was not advised by the Secretary or the manufacturer of that vessel, equipment or component that the vessel, equipment or component contains a defect which creates a substantial risk of personal injury to the public; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) holds a certificate issued by the manufacturer of that recreational vessel or associated equipment to the effect that the recreational vessel or associated equipment conforms to all applicable recreational vessel safety standards of the Government, unless the person knows or reasonably should have known that the recreational vessel or associated equipment does not so conform.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Compliance with this chapter or standards, regulations, or orders prescribed under this chapter does not relieve a person from liability at common law or under State law.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 4311 provides penalties for violating any of the provisions of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter. For a willful violation the penalty <!-- PDFPage:54 -->is a criminal fine; all other penalties are civil in nature.</p>
<p class="note-body">A person violating any of the prohibited acts specified in section 4307(a)(1) is subject to a maximum civil penalty that can go as high as a $100,000 for a related series of violations. However, the section provides for no liability for good faith reliance on certifications of compliance by others within the chain of responsibility and for defects that are not within an individual's responsibility or control.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section also contains an alternate procedure for the collection of a civil penalty of not more than $200 through a U.S. magistrate in lieu of the civil penalty procedures of the Coast Guard. It also directs the district courts of the United States to restrain the sale, offer for sale, introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce, or importation of a recreational vessel or associated equipment that does not conform to applicable safety standards. Finally, compliance with this chapter or standards, regulations, or orders does not relieve a person from liability at common law or under State law.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 5101 contains definitions that are limited to Chapter 51&mdash;Load Lines. Existing Section 46 App. U.S.C. 86a (which defines only the terms &ldquo;new ship&rdquo; and &ldquo;existing ship&rdquo;) will be replaced by section 5101. Definitions of technical terms (&ldquo;freeboard&rdquo;, &ldquo;freeboard deck&rdquo;, and &ldquo;minimum safe freeboard&rdquo;) have been added for clarity. The definition of the term &ldquo;new ship&rdquo; has been deleted because the term is not used in Chapter 51. The definition of &ldquo;domestic voyage&rdquo; includes the phrase &ldquo;places in or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.&rdquo; &ldquo;Places subject to the jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; include deep water ports, production platforms, mining sites outside of territorial waters of the United States but within the United States&rsquo; Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that was established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated March 10, 1983, or on the outer continental shelf. The phrases &ldquo;economic benefit of overloading&rdquo; and &ldquo;weight of the overload&rdquo; have been defined for purposes of establishing a standard method of determining the value of the cargo with which a vessel is overloaded. The value of the cargo will in turn affect the maximum penalty assessed for overloading the vessel. The definition of &ldquo;freeboard deck&rdquo; provides the Secretary with the authority to designate as the freeboard deck either the actual deck (on standard vessels) or another structure (on non-standard vessels). Non-standard vessels, for which this regulatory flexibility is necessary, include shelter deck vessels, semi-submersible multi-hull units, container ships, surface effect vessels, and commercial submarines.</p>

<p class="note-body">Clause (5) regarding &ldquo;a vessel otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States&rdquo; includes foreign vessels that are subject to United States jurisdiction as a result of bilateral agreements, licenses, customary international law or other means, including those using deepwater port or outer continental shelf or EEZ facilities located in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5102(b) lists the specific exemptions from load line requirements. The specific exemptions may be grouped as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(a) Vessel type (ships of war, pleasure vessels, fishing vessels, small passenger vessels on domestic voyages);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(b) Area of operation (rivers, harbors, bays, sounds, etc.);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(c) Minimum size (length); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(d) Treaty exclusions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (1) exempts vessels of war from load line requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (2) exempts recreational vessels operated only for pleasure from load line requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (3) exempts fishing vessels from load line requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clauses (4) and (5) exempt certain existing fish processing and fish tender vessels not on a foreign voyage from load line requirements. The exception is limited to those vessels not on international voyages to ensure compliance with United States obligations under the International Load Line Convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (6) exempts from load line requirements all U.S. vessels operating on domestic voyages within the Boundary Line, as defined in section 2101 of this title, except vessels operating on the Great Lakes.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (7) exempts all vessels that are less than 24 meters (79 feet) in length from load line requirements whether on international or domestic voyages.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (8) exempts from load line requirements those public vessels that are on domestic voyages.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (9) exempts from load line requirements those vessels which have been excluded from the requirements &ldquo;by specific action of a treaty of the United States.&rdquo; The only current treaty which excludes vessels from load line requirements is the Convention Between the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada Concerning Load Lines (49 Stat. 2685), which entered into force on August 11, 1934.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (10) exempts from load line requirements existing U.S. vessels that are under 150 gross tons while engaged on a domestic voyage. This is a grandfather provision, continuing the existing exemption for these vessels. Vessels built after January 1, 1986 must be marked with a load line, however, if they are over 79 feet long and do not qualify for any other exemption.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (11) exempts small passenger vessels engaged on domestic voyages from load line requirements. Small passenger vessels are inspected under Subchapter T of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Under Subchapter T, the Coast Guard regulates these vessels with regard to safety; the requirements are based on the number of passengers, length, and gross tonnage of the vessel. Safety-related requirements in Subchapter T regulations include hull structure and watertightness, stability, weathertight integrity, and safe movement of persons on deck, the principal safety features covered by load line regulations. This specific exemption from load line requirements for small passenger vessels is consistent with existing law and does not alter in any way the Coast Guard's authority to regulate small passenger vessels under Subchapter T.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (12) exempts vessels of the working voyages from the requirement to have load lines.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5102(c) authorizes the Secretary to assign load lines for any vessel exempted from load line requirements by subsection (b) upon the request of the owner. It also provides that any exempted vessel for which load lines are assigned will remain subject to the load line requirements until its load line certificate is surrendered and the load line marks are removed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 5102(d) provides that this chapter shall not be construed as abrogating the provisions of other treaties and conventions to which the United States is a party, which are not in conflict with the International Convention on Load Lines.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) requires the owner, charterer, agent, master, operator, or individual in charge of a vessel to report within 5 days, any casualty required in subsection (a) or by regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) requires the owner, charterer, managing operator, or agent of a U.S. vessel to immediately determine the status of their vessel if they have not heard from the vessel, if it has not passed a scheduled point, or for any other reason which may indicate the vessel may have been lost or imperiled. If the owner, charterer, managing operator, or agent cannot reach the vessel and determine that it is operating safely, then they shall immediately notify the Coast Guard and provide the Coast Guard with the name and number of the vessel, the names of individuals on board, and any other information that the Coast Guard may request. If communication with the vessel indicates the vessel was involved in a casualty, then the owner, charterer, or agent of the vessel must immediately notify the Coast Guard under subsection (b). Notification to the Coast Guard does not impose or create any additional responsibility for the Coast Guard to take search and rescue action beyond those already existing under title 14, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) makes it clear that the reporting requirements under subsection (b) are applicable to foreign vessels involved in a marine casualty when operating on the navigable waters of the United States, whether in innocent passage or not.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) provides for the classification of marine casualties by regulation according to the gravity of the casualty, injuries to individuals, property damage, dangers created, and size, occupation, and means of propulsion of each vessel.</p>

This section merely states the rights of a party in interest but does not necessarily determine who is to be considered a party in interest. Clause (4) states that these rights are to be afforded to &ldquo;any <em>other</em> person whose conduct is under investigation&rdquo; (emphasis added). This implies that clauses (1) through (3) apply to individuals whose conduct is under investigation. If any individual does not qualify for these rights under clauses (1) through (4), that individual can still be entitled to these rights under clause (5), if designated as a party in interest. Since parties in interest are not clearly set out by statute, the Secretary has the authority to do this by regulation under section 6301. Thus the rights of these parties as presently provided for in existing law have been retained.</p>

A manning requirement imposed on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a sailing school vessel shall consider the participation of sailing school instructors and sailing school students in the operation of that vessel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a mobile offshore drilling unit shall consider the specialized nature of the unit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a tank vessel shall consider the navigation, cargo handling, and maintenance functions of that vessel for protection of life, property, and the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary may modify the complement, by endorsement on the certificate, for reasons of changed conditions or employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A requirement made under this section by an authorized official may be appealed to the Secretary under prescribed regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A vessel to which this section applies may not be operated without having in its service the complement required in the certificate of inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When a vessel is deprived of the service of a member of its complement without the consent, fault, or collusion of the owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge of the vessel, the master shall engage, if obtainable, a number of members equal to the number of those of whose services the master has been deprived. The replacements must be of the same or a higher grade or rating than those whose places they fill. If the master finds the vessel is sufficiently manned for the voyage, and replacements are not available to fill all the vacancies, the vessel may proceed on its voyage. Within 12 hours after the vessel arrives at its destination, the master shall report in writing to the Secretary the cause of each deficiency in the complement. A master failing to make the report is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $1,000 for each deficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The owner, charterer, or managing operator of a vessel not manned as required by this section is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of $10,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A person may not employ an individual as, and an individual may not serve as, a master, mate, engineer, radio officer, or pilot of a vessel to which this part applies or which is subject to inspection under chapter 33 of this title if the individual is not licensed by the Secretary. A person (including an individual) violating this subsection is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of not more than $10,000. Each day of a continuing violation is a separate offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The owner, charterer, or managing operator of a freight vessel of less than 100 gross tons, a small passenger vessel, or a sailing school vessel not manned as required by this section is liable to the Government for a civil penalty of $1,000. The vessel also is liable in rem for the penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) When the 2 next most senior licensed officers on a vessel reasonably believe that the master or individual in charge of the vessel is under the influence of alcohol or a dangerous drug and is incapable of commanding the vessel, the next most senior master, mate, or operator licensed under section 7101(c)(1) or (3) of this title shall&mdash;</p>

Within 12 hours of arrival at its destination, the master is required to file a written report with the Secretary stating the cause of each deficiency or be liable for a civil penalty.

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) requires that the master, chief engineer, or officer in charge of a deck or engineering watch on a United States documented vessel be a United States citizen.</p>

The Secretary may reduce the percentage if the Secretary decides on investigation that United States seamen are not available. This investigation and percentage reduction authority is the sole responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation and accordingly the Secretary is to make these decisions expeditiously, promptly, and independently so as not to be dependent on any other agency to make this reduction. The Committee believes the Secretary is capable of this decision and need not delay or fail to make the decision because some other agency does not have the information or would require an extended period to acquire that information. The phrase &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; is used merely to emphasize the complete discretion of the Secretary in making this decision. In addition, because this decision is based on an investigation, formal procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsections (c) and (d) provide that a vessel, except a passenger vessel, on departure from the United States that has been granted a construction or operating differential subsidy have a higher percentage citizenship requirement. Subsection (c) requires all of the crew and employees of a cargo vessel be United States citizens. Subsection (d) requires at least 90 percent of the entire complement of a passenger vessel be United States citizens. The phrase &ldquo;including all licensed individuals&rdquo; emphasizes that all licensed individuals are required to be United States citizens as required by subsection (a) and that they compose part of the 90 percent requirement under this subsection. Further, under subsection (d), the balance of the complement must be individuals who have a declaration of intention to become a United States citizen or evidence of admission to the United States as a permanent resident and may only be employed in the steward's department of the passenger vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Except for the master, subsection (e) permits a non-United States citizen to fill a vacancy that occurs for any reason on a United States documented vessel during a foreign voyage until the vessel returns to a United States port where a United States citizen replacement can be obtained. The phrase &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; is used merely for emphasis.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (f) provides for the penalty for violation of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:85 --><p class="note-body">Subsection (g) requires a deck or engineer officer on a vessel that has been granted an operating differential subsidy or is under the control by the Department of Transportation to be, if eligible, a member of the Naval Reserve. This section does not apply to a vessel of the Coast Guard or the Saint Lawrance Seaway Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (h) permits the President to suspend the requirements of this section during a proclaimed national emergency or the requirement of subsection (a) for United States vessels documented for foreign trade when the needs of commerce require.</p>

<p class="note-body">For the Great Lakes towing vessels and merchant vessels in subsections (c) and (d(, subsection (e) requires that seamen be hired only for work in either the deck or the engine department. When in a safe harbor, seamen may be required to do only necessary work on Sundays and certain holidays, unless the vessel is getting underway on a voyage. Further, when in a safe harbor, this subsection restates the maximum 8-hour work day which applies even for anchor watch.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) applies this section to every United States vessel except a yacht, a fishing, whaling, or certain types of inland waterway vessel, and a ferry carrying passengers or cars on the Great Lakes. A ferry is a vessel that primarily carries passengers, cars, or trains from shore to shore as a means to connect existing points on a transportation route so that the same type of transportation mode may continue to be used upon arrival at either point. Vessels carrying cars as cargo would not be included in this type of vessel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) establishes the staff department as a separate one consisting of registered individuals (pursers, medical doctors, and professional nurses), clerks, and medical assistants. Subsection (c) divides the department into a medical division and a purser's division and designates the individual in charge of each division. Subsection (d) prescribes particular requirements of the purser's division based on size of the vessel or number of individuals employed in the division.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) prohibits the employment or service of an individual who is not registered or of the grade as required under this section and prescribes a penalty for violation of the subsection. This penalty applies to both the employer and the individual employed. If a registered staff officer is unavailable at the time of departure for a voyage, the vessel may proceed on its voyage with either an unregistered staff officer or without a staff officer.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Chapter 85 provides for State pilotage to be regulated by the States and only in conformity with the laws of the States. It clearly spells out the preeminence of the State's role in regulating pilots for vessels operating on the bays, rivers, harbors, and ports of the United States. However, those vessels that are required to have a Federally licensed pilot, those that operate on waters outside the territorial sea of the United States, and those that operate on waters of the Great Lakes are not subject to State pilotage laws or requirements. In essence this chapter, with minor changes, confirms the State and Federal relationship with respect to pilotage that has evolved since the founding of the Nation.</p>
<p class="note-body">This chapter permits the continuation of Federal pilotage requirements for vessels that are not required <!-- PDFPage:90 -->to obtain compulsory State pilotage. It confirms the practice of allowing anyone with a Federal pilotage endorsement for the waters in which the vessel is operating to be in control of a vessel when engaged in the coastwide trade. It also confirms the practice of using Federal pilots that are often organized into groups or working organizations who offer their expertise and services to vessels that are not required to obtain compulsory State pilotage.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A seaman's entitlement to wages and provisions begins when the seaman begins work or when specified in the agreement required by section 10302 of this title for the seaman to begin work or be present on board, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Wages are not dependent on the earning of freight by the vessel. When the loss or wreck of the vessel ends the service of a seaman before the end of the period contemplated in the agreement, the seaman is entitled to wages for the period of time actually served. The seaman shall be deemed a destitute seaman under section 11104 of this title. This subsection applies to a fishing or whaling vessel but not a yacht.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a seaman who has signed an agreement is discharged improperly before the beginning of the voyage or before one month's wages are earned, without the seaman's consent and without the seaman's fault justifying discharge, the seaman is entitled to receive from the master or owner, in addition to wages earned, one month's wages as compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A seaman is not entitled to wages for a period during which the seaman&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) unlawfully failed to work when required, after the time fixed by the agreement for the seaman to begin work; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) lawfully was imprisoned for an offense, unless a court hearing the case otherwise directs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) After the beginning of the voyage, a seaman is entitled to receive from the master, on demand, one-half of the balance of wages earned and unpaid at each port at which the vessel loads or delivers cargo during the voyage. A demand may not be made before the expiration of 5 days from the beginning of the voyage, not more than once in 5 days, and not more than once in the same port on the same entry. If a master does not comply with this subsection, the seaman is released from the agreement and is entitled to payment of all wages earned. Notwithstanding a release signed by a seaman under section 10312 of this title, a court having jurisdiction may set aside, for good cause shown, the release and take action that justice requires. This subsection does not apply to a fishing or whaling vessel or a yacht.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) At the end of a voyage, the master shall pay each seaman the balance of wages due the seaman within 24 hours after the cargo has been discharged or within 4 days after the seaman is discharged, whichever is earlier. When a seaman is discharged and final payment of wages is delayed for the period permitted by this subsection, the seaman is entitled at the time of discharge to one-third of the wages due the seaman.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) When payment is not made as provided under subsection (f) of this section without sufficient cause, the master or owner shall pay to the seaman 2 days&rsquo; wages for each day payment is delayed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Subsections (f) and (g) of this section do not apply to a fishing or whaling vessel or a yacht.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) This section applies to a seaman on a foreign vessel when in a harbor of the United States. The courts are available to the seaman for the enforcement of this section.</p>

Then the consular officer shall discharge the seaman. A consular officer shall require the payment of extra wages only as provided in this section or in chapter 109 of this title.</p>

If a seaman is incapacitated by illness or injury and prompt discharge is necessary, but a personal appearance of the master before a consular officer is impracticable, the master may provide transportation to the seaman to the nearest consular officer for discharge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) On application made under section 10902(a) of this title, the judge or justice of the peace <!-- PDFPage:114 -->shall appoint 3 experienced and skilled marine surveyors to examine the vessel for the defects or insufficiencies complained of. The surveyors have the authority to receive and consider evidence necessary to evaluate the complaint. When the complaint involves provisions of food or water, one of the surveyors shall be a medical officer of the Public Health Service, if available. The surveyors shall make a report in writing, signed by at least 2 of them, stating whether the vessel is fit to proceed to sea or, if not, in what respect it is unfit, making appropriate recommendations about additional seamen, provisions, or stores, or about physical repairs, alterations, or additions necessary to make the vessel fit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) On receiving the report, the judge or justice of the peace shall endorse on the report the judgment of the judge or justice on whether the vessel is fit to proceed on the voyage, and, if not, whether the vessel may proceed to another port at which the deficiencies can be corrected. The master and the crew shall comply with the judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The master shall pay all costs of the survey, report, and judgment. However, if the complaint of the crew appears in the report and judgment to have been without foundation, or if the complaint involved provisions of food or water, without reasonable grounds, the master or owner may deduct the amount of the costs and reasonable damages for the detention of the vessel, as determined by the judge or justice of the peace, from the wages of the complaining seamen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A master of a vessel violating this section who refuses to pay the costs and wages is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $100 and is liable in damages to each person injured by the refusal.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 12501</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of section 12501 requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish a system of information concerning vessels of the United States for law enforcement and other purposes. The Secretary is required to make available information from the system relating to the ownership of vessels documented under chapter 121 of title 46, numbered under chapter 123 of that title, and titled under the law of a State. The information is available under section 12503 for use by the public, similarly under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) lists the vessel identification information which is required to be maintained by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe other information to be maintained in addition to the items listed. For example, the Secretary may identify vessels issued fisheries permits by the Department of Commerce. The Secretary may also monitor transactions involving vessels that require approval by the Secretary under section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808) before interest or control in the vessel may be transferred to a noncitizen.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) clarifies that the Secretary has the flexibility to maintain this system in connection with any other information system maintained by the Secretary, including the Federal Aviation Administration system containing aircraft ownership information. This would also permit the Secretary to combine various systems and data bases maintained by the Secretary such as documentation and numbering of vessels, and safety, casualty, and law enforcement statistics.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 12503</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) of section 12503 allows a State or approved State delegee to make vessel identification information available to the Secretary. Participation in the system is voluntary on the part of a State. A benefit to boat purchasers and financiers in States with approved titling systems participating in this system is that vessel mortgages or financing instruments made in those States are deemed to be preferred mortgages under chapter 313 of title 46, United States Code (as codified and enacted by this Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (a), the Secretary may prescribe the manner and form in which the information is made available by the States. In this regard, the Committee intends that the Secretary employ the most efficient, up-to-date computer technology in maintaining information made available from the States to avoid duplication of effort in maintaining information and to reduce the costs of the system. In addition to the vessel identification information made available by States under paragraphs (1)&ndash;(6), the Secretary and a State may agree that the State make available other information. For example, the purpose for which a vessel is routinely used would be valuable information for the system.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Committee intends that most of the information in the system will become available directly and exclusively from the States to the greatest extent possible. However, under subsection (b), the Secretary may accept information from others under conditions and in a manner and form prescribed by the Secretary. Thus, if the Secretary discovers a valuable and reliable source of data that can be conveniently made available to the system, the Secretary can approve it.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under paragraph (c)(1), the Secretary must maintain information on a State-titled vessel with a preferred mortgage that moves to a nonparticipating, nontitle State, until the mortgage is discharged or the vessel is sold. Under paragraph (c)(2), the Secretary must accept information submitted under section 31321 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act) concerning a discharge of a preferred mortgage on a vessel title under State law. This would be necessary if the vessel moves to a nonparticipating State, and information on that vessel would not be provided to the system by that State. This subsection will allow the Secretary to keep the vessel information system current on these matters and purge files no longer required to be maintained.</p>

<p class="note-body">This section contains the authority for the Secretary to charge a fee under the user charge law, 31 U.S.C. 9701, for providing information to or requesting information from the vessel identification system. Fees may not be charged under this subsection to an agency or a State that is participating in the vessel identification system maintained by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may collect an annual fee of not more than $1.00 from the owner of a vessel of the United States under 31 U.S.C. 9701 for the vessel identification system. Since vessel owners will benefit from the vessel identification system, such as from documentation of ownership data and stolen vessel tracking, this fee is designed as a maintenance charge to owners for this service. The collection of the annual fee may be delayed by the Secretary, and an agency, State, or person may be employed to collect the fee under subsection (c). The Committee expects that the Secretary will make agreements with States to collect this fee at the time of vessel registrations. The term of these registrations varies from one to three years as permitted by chapter 123 of title 46.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (d) of this section, if a State is employed to collect the fee, the State may retain one-half of the amounts collected, and must transfer the remainder to the Secretary. The amounts retained by a State may be used to cover the costs of making vessel identification information available to the Secretary. This includes upgrading or establishing titling systems as well as making improvements and other changes to vessel numbering systems to make information available. Because States are allowed to make improvements to their vessel titling and numbering systems with the amounts retained under this section, the costs of those programs may decrease. This could result in a corresponding decrease in State numbering fees and offset vessel identification system fees paid by vessel owners.</p>

Tonnage is a measurement of a vessel's volume and is used for international, customs, and regulatory purposes.

<p class="note-body">Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14103(a) authorizes the Secretary to delegate to a qualified person the authority to measure a vessel and issue an International Tonnage Certificate or other certificate of measurement. The term &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; means an organization that the Secretary believes has the necessary qualifications to measure a vessel competently, such as the American Bureau of Shipping.</p>
<p class="note-body">The conferees intend that in section 14103 the term &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; includes not only organizations that the Secretary finds to be qualified to perform measurement duties, but any person as that term is defined in section 1 of title 1, United States Code (including individuals), that the Secretary determines qualified to perform measurement duties. The House and Senate conferees also agree that, where authorized, in addition to information required by the Secretary, regulatory tonnage should be used on all certificates and documents related to a vessel unless the owner otherwise requests.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14103(b) provides for the appeal to the Secretary of a decision made by a person that has received delegated authority. This ensures that the Secretary has full oversight of delegated tonnage measurement functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14103(c) authorizes the Secretary to delegate to a country that is a party to the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, the authority to measure a vessel and issue an International Tonnage Certificate.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14103(d) clarifies the Secretary's authority to revoke at any time and without cause a delegation of authority to measure a vessel or issue a certificate. This authority is given so that no delay occurs administratively in revoking a delegation wherever the Secretary decides a revocation is warranted.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 14301 delineates which vessels must be measured in compliance with the standards of the Convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(a) provides that a vessel must be measured under the standards of the Convention if it is documented or required by law to be documented under chapter 121 of this subtitle or if it is engaged on a foreign voyage, unless the vessel is specifically exempted under section 14301(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(b) provides the following exemptions from the requirement in section 14301(a) to be measured under the Convention:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">1. A vessel of war;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">2. A vessel of less than 24 meters (79 feet) overall in length (&ldquo;overall in length&rdquo; is defined in section 2101);</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">4. A vessel whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of construction before January 1, 1986, and is on a domestic voyage, unless the vessel undergoes a change that significantly changes its tonnage or the owner requests that the vessel be measured under the Convention; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Together, subsections (b)(4) and (5) provide that, unless the owner requests measurement under the Convention, unaltered vessels built before 1986 engaging only on domestic voyages do not have to be measured under the Convention or use Convention measurement for the application of any domestic laws. Further, these subsections provide that unaltered vessels that are built before July 18, 1982, engaging on foreign voyages do not have to be measured under the Convention until 1994 and are not required to use Convention measurement as a basis for the application of any domestic laws.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(c) provides that if a vessel owner requests that the vessel be measured under the Convention, the vessel may only be remeasured under the Convention.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14301(d) provides that after July 18, 1994, a vessel whose keel was laid or was at a similar stage of construction before July 18, 1982 may retain its regulatory tonnage for the application of requirements under U.S. laws or international agreements, except the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships. However, if the vessel was not required to be measured under the Convention, but the vessel's owner requested that the vessel be measured under the Convention system before July 19, 1994, or if the vessel undergoes a change affecting its tonnage, the vessel may not use its regulatory tonnage for the application of U.S. laws or international agreements after July 19, 1994.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head"><em>Revised section 14305</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Source: International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14305 requires that the Secretary measure a vessel under chapter 145 (Regulatory Measurement) of this title (in addition to measuring it under the Convention) at the request of the owner. For vessels that have obtained a regulatory tonnage measurement under this section, the Secretary is required to use the regulatory tonnage measurement to determine the application of those laws listed in section 14305(a) and those not listed by the Secretary by regulation, as provided in section 14302(c). It is the intent of the Committee to list in section 14305(a) certain U.S. tonnage-based laws that would impose increased regulatory burdens on industry if the Convention measurement were used for applicability determinations.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:148 --><p class="note-body">Clause (1) of section 14305(a) includes the following parts of subtitle II of title 46, U.S.C.:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part A: General provisions (including definitions.)</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part B: Inspection and Regulation of Vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part C: Load Lines, which is enacted as part of this legislation. Although most load line requirements are based on vessel length, and not tonnage, a few requirements are based on tonnage. (It is only the tonnage based requirements to which this provision applies.)</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part E: Licenses, Certificates, and Merchant Mariners&rsquo; Documents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part F: Manning of Vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part G: Merchant Seamen Protection and Relief.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Part H: Sections 12106(c) and 12108(c) only&mdash;Identification of Vessels.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other U.S. laws listed in clause (2) through (10) of this section are self-explanatory. Clause (10) refers to domestic law as well as the Officers&rsquo; Competency Certificates Convention, 1936.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, three other international conventions are listed in clauses (11) through (13): (1) the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, (2) the Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, and (3) the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The International Maritime Organization has established interim schemes which address the use of the Convention tonnage measurement system as a basis for the applicability of these three conventions. The applicable sections of those schemes are the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea: IMCO Resolution A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981 provides &ldquo;that at the request of a shipowner, the Administration may allow a ship required to be measured under the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, to use the gross tonnage measured under the national tonnage rules which are in effect prior to the coming into force of the 1969 Tonnage Convention, for the purpose of application of the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, such tonnage, however, shall not be shown on the 1969 Tonnage Certificate.&rdquo; The resolution further provides that &ldquo;the interim scheme shall not apply to ships the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985 with the following exceptions:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(a) In respect of the requirements of Regulation 3 of Chapter IV of the 1974 SOLAS Convention for ships the keels of which are laid before 18 July 1994, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme, in which case the above-mentioned entry should be made in the Radio-telephony Certificate only; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(b) In respect of the regulations for cargo ships of less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage (as measured under national systems), the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18 July 1984.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978: IMO Resolution A.540 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, provides &ldquo;that the revised interim scheme for tonnage measurement for certain ships adopted by resolution A.494 (XII), [described above] should also be applicable in respect of the provision of the International Convention, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973: IMO Resolution A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983, provides that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">At the request of a shipowner, the Administration may allow a ship of less than 400 tons gross tonnage (measured under the previous national tonnage rules) the keel of which is laid on or before 31 December 1985 and which is required to be measured under the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, to use the gross tonnage measured under the national tonnage rules which were in effect prior to the coming into force of the 1969 Tonnage Convention, for the purpose of application of the provisions of MARPOL 73/78. Such tonnage, however, shall not be shown on the 1969 Tonnage Certificate.</p>
<p class="note-body">It further provides that &ldquo;the interim scheme shall not apply to ships the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, except that in respect of regulations for ships of less than 400 tons gross tonnage (as measured under previous national rules), the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18 July 1994.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (14) provides that the regulatory measurement system may be used to determine which vessels must demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility (when such a demonstration is required by law). If it is determined that a vessel must show evidence of financial responsibility, the limits of financial responsibility are determined using the vessel's Convention measurement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (15) provides that the regulatory measurement system may be used for the application of laws not identified by the Secretary under section 14302(c).</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 14305(b) provides that if a vessel is measured under the regulatory tonnage measurement system for the application of one law listed in subsection (a), it must be measured under that system for the application of all laws listed in subsection (a).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 101 [102] of H.R. 3105 revises, consolidates, and enacts certain general and permanent laws of the United States related to commercial instruments and liens and public vessels and goods. It amends subtitle III of title 46, United States Code by striking at the end &ldquo;Chapters 313, 315&mdash;Reserved&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;Chapter 313&mdash;Commercial Instruments and Maritime Liens&rdquo;. Chapter 313 is essentially a codification of the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 911&ndash;984). H.R. 3105 is the second step in the process of enacting laws compiled in title 46 of the Code into positive law. The first step in the codification process began in 1983 when certain general and permanent laws related to vessels and seamen were enacted as subtitle II of the title 46, United States Code.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 102 of this bill adds a new subtitle III to title 46, which contains a codification of the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920 and other related provisions. A previous version of this codification and the remaining sections of the bill were recently reported by the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee in H.R. 3105 (H. Rept. 100&ndash;918). The significant additions or changes by this provision to the version of H.R. 3105 reported by the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee are explained as follows: [see sections 30101, 31305, 31321, 31322, 31325, 31329, 31330, 31343 of this title].</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 31301(1) defines the term &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo;. This paragraph makes a substantive change to law to expand the current law by allowing a notarization under State law, a form prescribed by the Secretary, as well as a certificate issued under the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, 1961.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31301(2) defines &ldquo;district court&rdquo;. This paragraph makes a substantive change to law by including the District Court of Guam, the District Court of the Virgin Islands, the District Court of the Northern Mariana Islands, the High Court of American Samoa, and other Federal territorial courts as they are established. Under current law, only the district courts of the United States have jurisdiction under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31301(3) defines &ldquo;mortgagee&rdquo; as a person to whom property is mortgaged and the trustee authorized under section 31328 that is designated in the trust agreement.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31301(4) defines &ldquo;necessaries&rdquo; to include repairs, supplies, towage, and the use of a drydock and marine railway for a vessel. As in all codifications, the term &ldquo;includes&rdquo; means &ldquo;includes but is not limited to&rdquo; and, therefore, is not intended to be an exclusive listing of those items that a court has determined or may determine as falling within the meaning of the term &ldquo;other necessaries&rdquo; as contained in current law. The definition is new, is based on 46 App. U.S.C. 971&ndash;974, and makes no substantive change to law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31301(5) defines &ldquo;preferred maritime lien&rdquo; to mean a lien on a vessel that arises before a preferred mortgage was filed under section 31321 of this title for damages arising out of maritime tort, stevedore wages, crew wages, general average, and salvage. The definition is new and is based on 46 App. U.S.C. 953(a). The only substantive change to law made by this paragraph is to change the effective date from the day the preferred mortgage is recorded and endorsed to when it is filed. This change is in keeping with other changes with regard to filing. The term &ldquo;duly and validly&rdquo; that is in existing law is not used because it is unnecessary. An instrument that is not &ldquo;duly and validly&rdquo; executed is not executed under the laws of the foreign country. This makes no substantive change to law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31301(6)(A) defines &ldquo;preferred mortgage&rdquo; to mean a mortgage that meets the requirements of section 31322. This clause makes no substantive change to law.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:155 --><p class="note-body">Section 31301(6)(B) defines &ldquo;preferred mortgage&rdquo; to also mean a mortgage on a documented foreign vessel that is preferred under sections 31325 and 31326 for purposes of enforcement of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness. Preference is only granted if the mortgage is executed under the laws of a foreign country, registered under those laws in a public register at the port of registry or at a central office. The use of the word &ldquo;established&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;created&rdquo; in the current law or &ldquo;effective&rdquo; as used in the treaties is not intended to make any substantive change to law. The only substantive changes to law made by this clause are the elimination of the exemption of foreign vessels of less than 200 gross tons, and clarification of the rule of interpretation that if a vessel is registered in one country, but is permitted to fly temporarily the flag of another country (such as through a demise charter), it is the law of the country in which the ownership of the vessel is documented that is used to determine when a mortgage attains preferred status.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 31304 imposes liability on the mortgagor if the mortgagor, master, or other individual in charge of the vessel does not comply with the statutory requirements. A civil action may be brought in a district court of the United States for losses incurred. If the plaintiff prevails, the court shall award costs and attorneys fees to the plaintiff. This section makes two substantive changes to law. First, is the broadening of its coverage from documented vessels covered by a preferred mortgage to any vessel covered by a mortgage that is filed or recorded under the chapter. The second substantive change repeals the liability on the United States Government for losses caused because the Secretary did not comply with statutory requirements. This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act due to the nondiscretionary responsibility of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 31321(a)(1) provides for the filing of a bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related instrument of a vessel. This subsection makes substantive changes to law. The bill would allow a bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related instrument to be filed at the same time an application for documentation under chapter 121 is filed. The Committee intends that the types of related instruments required to be filed be defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation. A major change the bill makes is that the instrument needs only be filed with the Secretary of Transportation to be valid. It is not necessary that it be recorded. This change is being made to eliminate a problem under existing law that prevents a person from recording an instrument when the vessel has not been yet documented. When filed with the Secretary, it is valid (to the extent the vessel is involved) against any person except the grantor, mortgagor, or assignor, their heirs or devisees, and a person having actual notice of that instrument. Clauses (A)&ndash;(C) make no substantive change to law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) provides that each bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related instrument that is filed in substantial compliance with the requirements of this section is valid against any person from the time it is filed with the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:158 --><p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) provides that it is the responsibility of the parties to an instrument to use diligence to ensure that the particulars of a filed instrument for which they are responsible are in substantial compliance. It is not the responsibility of the Secretary to validate the information in the instrument. If an instrument is later found to be invalid because it is not in substantial compliance, and the parties lose the benefits of a preferred mortgage, it is their fault, not the Secretary's.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31321(b) sets out the requirements that an instrument must meet to be properly filed. To be filed the instruments must: (1) identify the vessel; (2) state the name and address of each party to the instrument; (3) state, if a mortgage, the amount of the direct or contingent obligations (in one or more units of account as agreed to by the parties) that is or may become secured by the mortgage, excluding interest, expenses, and fees; (4) state the interest of the grantor, mortgagor, or assignor; (5) state the interest sold, conveyed, mortgaged, or assigned; and (6) be signed and acknowledged. While most of these items are required under current law to be included in the index, and therefore required to be submitted to the Secretary to be recorded, this subsection makes a number of substantive changes to law. First, while vessel names are currently required to be submitted, this requirement has been broadened so that hull identification numbers and official numbers can be used to more specifically identify a vessel (since many vessels have the same name). Second, it requires the mortgage to state the maximum amount of the obligation, including principal, interest, fees, etc., that are secured by the mortgage. It also clarifies that the mortgage obligation may be payable in more than one unit of account, such as yen, franc, or special drawing right. Third, it recognizes that under some modern financing practices an instrument may not have a date of maturity. The requirement for supplying the date of maturity has been eliminated.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31321(c) provides that if an instrument filed involves a vessel that has not yet been documented, and the Secretary decides that the vessel cannot be documented by the applicant, then the Secretary shall send notice of that denial to the parties, including the reasons for the Secretary's decision. If the parties have not corrected the deficiencies within 90 days, the Secretary may terminate the filing and return the instruments. This invalidates the instruments.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31321(d) prohibits a person from withdrawing an application for documentation of a vessel for which a mortgage has been filed unless the mortgagee consents. Since the withdrawal will invalidate the mortgage, the mortgagee should be allowed to prohibit the withdrawal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31321(e) makes a substantive change to law. It requires the Secretary to record instruments in the order they are received for filing, not in the order in which they were received for recording. It also makes a substantive change by eliminating the specific indexes required under the law and substituting a general requirement for the Secretary to maintain indexes of instruments filed or recorded, or both, for use by the public. These indexes, prescribed by regulations, must be in keeping with U.S. obligations under treaties to which the United States is a party. Since section 104 [105] of this Act makes the existing rules and regulations applicable under this subsection, the current indexing system will be maintained that includes the names of the vessels; names of the parties to the instruments; time and date each instrument was received; the interest in the vessel that was sold, conveyed, mortgaged, or assigned; and the date of the maturity of the mortgage, if any. However, it allows the Secretary by regulation to automate the system with computers, as long as the new system provides the public with an adequate method of finding and examining these public records.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31321(f) makes a substantive change to law by eliminating the requirement that a partial discharge of indebtedness be filed with the Secretary. The bill requires that on the full and final discharge of indebtedness the mortgagee, on request of the Secretary or mortgagor, shall provide the Secretary with a written, acknowledged certificate of discharge of the indebtedness. This subsection also makes a substantive change by requiring that the mortgagee, not the mortgagor, provide the certificate of discharge. The Secretary shall then record the certificate. However, this does not prohibit a person from submitting a certificate of discharge under subsection (a) since it is a related instrument. This subsection also makes a substantive change to law by eliminating the requirement that the discharge be endorsed on the vessel's certificate of documentation, and that the Customs Service only may clear a vessel after an endorsement has been made. This change is made because of the elimination of endorsements under section 31322.</p>

<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">house floor statement</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 31321 has been changed to clarify that a mortgage, whenever made, must be filed to be valid against third parties. This clarification allows mortgage closings to occur previous to filing of an instrument, and to eliminate the need for a fictional simultaneous closing and filing.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (g) clarifies that if an application for documentation is filed for a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage under section 31322(d) (as enacted by this Act), the preferred mortgage must be filed with the Secretary at the same time the application for documentation is filed to be valid against third parties. If the preferred mortgage is filed with the Secretary at the time the documentation application is filed, it is valid from the time it became a preferred mortgage under section 31322(d).</p>
<p class="note-body">When a State preferred mortgage under section 31322(d) is finally discharged, subsection (h) of this section requires the mortgagee to provide upon request to the Secretary or a State, whichever is more appropriate, an acknowledged certificate of discharge of indebtedness. This is necessary when a vessel in the system moves from a participating titling State and is not retitled in another participating State. In this case, there is no way to update the status of the indebtedness through the original titling State. The Secretary is required to accept this information to be maintained in the vessel identification system under section 12503(c) of title 46 (as enacted by this Act).</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 31322 sets out the conditions that must be met for a mortgage to be considered a preferred mortgage, and the types of endorsements that the Secretary must make on any certificate of documentation of a vessel that is to be covered by a preferred mortgage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(1) makes many substantive changes to law. While a preferred mortgage must still include the whole of a vessel, this subsection eliminates the exception of certain vessels under 25 gross tons. It allows a vessel for which an application for documentation has been filed to have a preferred mortgage. It allows a mortgage to be a preferred mortgage from the time all four conditions are met, rather than from when the vessel is finally documented. Therefore, a mortgage will usually attain its preferred status when the application for documentation and the instrument have been filed. This subsection changes the requirement that all documented vessels have as a mortgagee a person that is a citizen of the United States, as defined in section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, and allows a State, the United States Government, a federally insured depository institution, or any other person approved by the Secretary to be a mortgagee.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(2) makes a substantive change to law exempting fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels, and vessels operated only for pleasure from the mortgagee restrictions, since these vessels do not have significant national defense use.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) permits a preferred mortgage to have any rate of interest that is agreeable to the parties to the mortgage. This subsection makes no substantive change to law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c)(1) applies to a mortgage that covers more than one vessel or additional property that is not a vessel. This subsection allows a preferred mortgage to include a separate discharge of the additional vessels and property.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c)(2) applies when a preferred mortgage covers more than one vessel, does not provide for the separate discharge of a vessel, and is to be sold by court order. The amount of the mortgage indebtedness attributable to a vessel is that part of the indebtedness, increased by 20 percent, that the court determines approximates the value that the particular vessel bears to the value of all the vessels and property covered by the mortgage. In other words, the amount to be set by the court is the estimated value of the one vessel plus 20 percent of that value to assure sufficiency of collateral.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section also makes a substantive change by eliminating the requirement that a vessel's certificate of documentation be endorsed with information from the mortgage. This change is made since most of the information is out of date when examined, and since a <!-- PDFPage:160 -->mortgage must be carried on self-propelled vessels under section 31324(b). This section also eliminates the requirement for the inclusion of an affidavit of good faith. However, both criminal and civil penalties have been added [in section 31330] to help ensure that there is not fraud. This section also eliminates the requirement that a preferred mortgage include a separate discharge for additional property that is not a vessel, the requirement that the mortgage does not stipulate that the mortgagee waives the mortgage's preferred status; and the requirement for clearing vessels with endorsed documents through Customs.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">house floor statement</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under section 31322(a)(2) a &ldquo;vessel operated only for pleasure&rdquo; is exempt from any restrictions on who can be a mortgagee. This standard is the same as used for the documentation of a recreational vessel under section 12109 of title 46. The Committee intends that vessels that have a recreational vessel license, or combined fisheries and recreational license, fall under this exemption. However, if the vessel has a Coastwise License, Great Lakes License, or Registry combined with a Recreational License, the vessel would not fall under this exemption.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (c)(2), if a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage that includes more than one vessel or property that is not a vessel is to be sold on the order of a district court <em>in rem</em>, and there is not a separate discharge, then the mortgage constitutes a lien on that vessel in the full amount of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness, and an allocation of mortgage indebtedness for purposes of a separate discharge may not be made. This change is made to eliminate the formula that did not work and to allow the vessel to be sold free and clear, regardless of the amount of the sale.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under subsection (d) of section 31322, a mortgage or other instrument representing financing of a vessel under State law that is made under applicable State law and covers the whole of a vessel titled in a State is deemed to be a preferred mortgage if two conditions are fulfilled. The first condition is that the Secretary must certify that the State in which the vessel is titled has a titling system that complies with the Secretary's vessel titling guidelines established under section 13106(b)(8) of title 46. Congress mandated the promulgation of these guidelines in the Recreational Boating Safety Act of 1986, Public Law 99&ndash;626. The second condition is that the State in which the vessel is titled must make information available to the Secretary for the vessel identification system established under chapter 125 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act) on the vessel covered by the mortgage or other instrument. This status only applies to vessels titled in the State after those two conditions are met. The phrase &ldquo;instrument representing financing of a vessel under State law&rdquo; is used in addition to &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; because State laws do not always use the term mortgage when referring to financing. It is intended, however, that the financing covered by this phrase would be the same as that covered by the concept of a mortgage under other Federal law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) of subsection (d) clarifies that mortgages or other financing instruments may obtain preferred status under subsection (d) if they cover vessels titled in a State after the Secretary certifies the compliance of the State's titling system, and the State begins making vessel identification information available to the Secretary. Preferred mortgage status can only be attained when these two conditions are in effect. Mortgages or financing instruments made prior to that are not preferred and, if these two conditions cease to exist, new mortgages or forecasting instruments made after that time cannot attain preferred status.</p>
<p class="note-body">The law of the titling State controls the making of the preferred mortgage or financing instrument under this subsection. No additional Federal recording requirements may be imposed for the mortgage or instrument to obtain preferred status under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) of this subsection ensures that a preferred mortgage under this subsection retains that status if the vessel covered by the mortgage later relinquishes its title. If the vessel is subsequently documented, the continuing validity of the mortgage is determined by section 31321(g) (as enacted by this Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) of section 31322 clarifies the validity of preferred mortgages made under subsection (d). In the case of a State titled vessel covered by a preferred mortgage for which a new titling application is filed, the validity of the mortgage is governed by the law of the titling State in which the mortgage became preferred. In the case of a documented vessel covered by a preferred mortgage for which an application for a State title is filed, or a State titled vessel covered by a preferred mortgage for which an application for documentation is filed, the validity of the preferred mortgage is governed by section 31322(a) of title 46 (as enacted by this Act).</p>
<p class="note-body">Information on vessels with preferred mortgages made under State law will be available to creditors from the vessel identification system under chapter 125 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act).</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 31325 provides for the enforcement of a preferred mortgage lien.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31325(a) makes a &ldquo;preferred mortgage&rdquo; a lien on the vessel in the amount of the mortgage indebtedness secured by the vessel outstanding at foreclosure. This subsection makes no substantive change to law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31325(b) provides that, on default of any term, the mortgagee may enforce the preferred mortgage lien in a civil action <em>in rem</em>, or <em>in personam</em> in admiralty against the mortgagor, comaker, or guarantor for the amount of the outstanding indebtedness secured by the vessel or any deficiency in paying off that indebtedness. This subsection makes a substantive change to law by allowing a nonadmiralty civil action to be brought against the mortgagor, comaker, or guarantor for the amount of the outstanding indebtedness secured by the vessel or any deficiency in paying off that indebtedness. This change allows an action to be brought even when the vessel is outside U.S. jurisdiction. This section will also allow the action to be brought against the comaker or guarantor of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31325(c) provides for original and exclusive jurisdiction by a district court, to the exclusion of the courts of a State for civil actions brought <em>in rem</em>. It also provides for original jurisdiction for civil actions brought <em>in personam</em> in admiralty and civil actions brought under subsection (b)(3). This subsection makes a substantive change to law by broadening the jurisdiction to courts in the territories, as defined in section 31301, as well as giving original jurisdiction to the district courts in nonadmiralty civil actions brought to enforce the preferred mortgage lien.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (d) provides that actual notice of a civil action <em>in rem</em> to enforce a maritime lien must be given in a manner directed by the court to the master, individual in charge of the vessel, to any person that recorded a notice of a claim of an undischarged lien, and, for the first time, to the mortgagee of a mortgage filed with the Secretary. This notice is not required if, after a search is made that is satisfactory to the court, the person entitled to notice is not found in the United States. Failure to give notice does not affect the court's jurisdiction. However, the mortgagor is still liable to the person not notified for damages in the amount of that person's interest in the vessel that was terminated by the civil action <em>in rem</em>, and a civil action may still be brought to recover the amount of the terminated interest. The district courts have original jurisdiction of the action, regardless of the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties. If plaintiff prevails, the court shall award costs and attorneys fees to the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (e) provides that, in a civil action <em>in rem</em>, the court may appoint a receiver and authorize operation of the vessel. When directed by the court, a United States marshal may take possession&mdash;even if the vessel is in the possession of or under the control of a person claiming a possessory common law lien. This subsection makes a substantive change to law by allowing the court to retain <em>in rem</em> jurisdiction over the vessel even if the receiver operates the vessel outside the district in which the court is located.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 31326(a) provides for a court-ordered sale to enforce a preferred mortgage lien or a maritime lien and the priority of claims. When a mortgaged vessel is sold by court order in a civil action <em>in rem</em>, any prior claim in the vessel is terminated&mdash;including any possessory common law lien. This subsection makes a substantive change to law by making the process the same for maritime liens as was provided for preferred mortgage liens. This eliminates the requirement for making a new mortgagee for a court sale to enforce a maritime lien. This section also broadens the jurisdiction to courts in the territories, as defined in section 31301.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31326(b)(1) provides that each of these terminated claims attaches, in the same amount and priority, to the proceeds of sale&mdash;except that the preferred mortgage lien always has priority over these other claims. However, the preferred mortgage lien is still subordinated to expenses and fees allowed by the court, costs imposed by the court, and any preferred maritime liens. This may include statutory fees such as the fee of the United States Marshal under 28 U.S.C. 1921. Except for broadening its coverage under subsection (a), this makes no substantive change to law.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 31326(b)(2) provides in the case of a foreign vessel, the preferred mortgage lien is also subordinated to a maritime lien for necessaries performed or supplied for the vessel in the United States. &ldquo;Provided&rdquo; has been substituted for &ldquo;provided or supplied&rdquo; for consistency in usage. Except for broadening its coverage under subsection (a), this paragraph makes no substantive change to law.</p>

Second, while being held for resale, the vessel is subject to requisition or purchase during a national emergency under section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 App. U.S.C. 1242).
