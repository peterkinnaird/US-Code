<p class="statutory-body">(1) When necessary to the proper functioning of the Commission and the prompt and orderly conduct of its business, the Commission may, by published rule or by order, delegate any of its functions (except functions granted to the Commission by this paragraph and by paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of this subsection and except any action referred to in sections 204(a)(2), 208(b), and 405(b) of this title) to a panel of commissioners, an individual commissioner, an employee board, or an individual employee, including functions with respect to hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting, or otherwise acting as to any work, business, or matter; except that in delegating review functions to employees in cases of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title 5), the delegation in any such case may be made only to an employee board consisting of two or more employees referred to in paragraph (8) of this subsection. Any such rule or order may be adopted, amended, or rescinded only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Commission then holding office. Except for cases involving the authorization of service in the instructional television fixed service, or as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the Commission to provide for the conduct, by any person or persons other than persons referred to in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 556(b) of title 5, of any hearing to which such section applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any person aggrieved by any such order, decision, report or action may file an application for review by the Commission within such time and in such manner as the Commission shall prescribe, and every such application shall be passed upon by the Commission. The Commission, on its own initiative, may review in whole or in part, at such time and in such manner as it shall determine, any order, decision, report, or action made or taken pursuant to any delegation under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:37 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) In passing upon applications for review, the Commission may grant, in whole or in part, or deny such applications without specifying any reasons therefor. No such application for review shall rely on questions of fact or law upon which the panel of commissioners, individual commissioner, employee board, or individual employee has been afforded no opportunity to pass.</p>

The time within which a petition for review must be filed in a proceeding to which section 402(a) of this title applies, or within which an appeal must be taken under section 402(b) of this title, shall be computed from the date upon which public notice is given of orders disposing of all applications for review filed in any case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The employees to whom the Commission may delegate review functions in any case of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title 5) shall be qualified, by reason of their training, experience, and competence, to perform such review functions, and shall perform no duties inconsistent with such review functions. Such employees shall be in a grade classification or salary level commensurate with their important duties, and in no event less than the grade classification or salary level of the employee or employees whose actions are to be reviewed. In the performance of such review functions such employees shall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable and shall not be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of any officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for any agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The secretary and seal of the Commission shall be the secretary and seal of each panel of the Commission, each individual commissioner, and each employee board or individual employee exercising functions delegated pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Meetings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Meetings of the Commission shall be held at regular intervals, not less frequently than once each calendar month, at which times the functioning of the Commission and the handling of its work load shall be reviewed and such orders shall be entered and other action taken as may be necessary or appropriate to expedite the prompt and orderly conduct of the business of the Commission with the objective of rendering a final decision (1) within three months from the date of filing in all original application, renewal, and transfer cases in which it will not be necessary to hold a hearing, and (2) within six months from the final date of the hearing in all hearing cases.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recovery of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission, in accordance with this section, shall assess and collect regulatory fees to recover the costs of the following regulatory activities of the Commission: enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and international activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fees contingent on appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fees described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be collected only if, and only in the total amounts, required in Appropriations Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment and adjustment of regulatory fees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fees assessed under subsection (a) of this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be derived by determining the full-time equivalent number of employees performing the activities described in subsection (a) of this section within the Private Radio Bureau, Mass Media Bureau, Common Carrier Bureau, and other offices of the Commission, adjusted to take into account factors that are reasonably related to the benefits provided to the payor of the fee by the Commission's activities, including such factors as service area coverage, shared use versus exclusive use, and other factors that the Commission determines are necessary in the public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be established at amounts that will result in collection, during each fiscal year, of an amount that can reasonably be expected to equal the amount appropriated for such fiscal year for the performance of the activities described in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) until adjusted or amended by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), be the fees established by the Schedule of Regulatory Fees in subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mandatory adjustment of schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year after fiscal year 1994, the Commission shall, by rule, revise the Schedule of Regulatory Fees by proportionate increases or decreases to reflect, in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), changes in the amount appropriated for the performance of the activities described in subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year. Such proportionate increases or decreases shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be adjusted to reflect, within the overall amounts described in appropriations Acts under the authority of paragraph (1)(A), unexpected increases or decreases in the number of licensees or units subject to payment of such fees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be established at amounts that will result in collection of an aggregate amount of fees pursuant to this section that can reasonably be expected to equal the aggregate amount of fees that are required to be collected by appropriations Acts pursuant to paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Increases or decreases in fees made by adjustments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review. In making adjustments pursuant to this paragraph the Commission may round such fees to the nearest $5 in the case of fees under $1,000, or to the nearest $25 in the case of fees of $1,000 or more.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permitted amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the adjustments required by paragraph (2), the Commission shall, by regulation, amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees if the Commission determines that the Schedule requires amendment to comply with the requirements of paragraph (1)(A). In making such amendments, the Commission shall add, delete, or reclassify services in the Schedule to reflect additions, deletions, or changes in the nature of its services as a consequence of Commission rulemaking proceedings or changes in law. Increases or decreases in fees made by amendments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) transmit to the Congress notification of any adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (2) immediately upon the adoption of such adjustment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) transmit to the Congress notification of any amendment made pursuant to paragraph (3) not later than 90 days before the effective date of such amendment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Penalties for late payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prescribe by regulation an additional charge which shall be assessed as a penalty for late payment of fees required by subsection (a) of this section. Such penalty shall be 25 percent of the amount of the fee which was not paid in a timely manner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dismissal of applications for filings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may dismiss any application or other filing for failure to pay in a timely manner any fee or penalty under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Revocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to or in lieu of the penalties and dismissals authorized by paragraphs (1) and (2), the Commission may revoke any instrument of authorization held by any entity that has failed to make payment of a regulatory fee assessed pursuant to this section. Such revocation action may be taken by the Commission after notice of the Commission's intent to take such action is sent to the licensee by registered mail, return receipt requested, at the licensee's last known address. The notice will provide the licensee at least 30 days to either pay the fee or show cause why the fee does not apply to the licensee or should otherwise be waived or payment deferred. A hearing is not required under this subsection unless the licensee's response presents a substantial and <!-- PDFPage:46 -->material question of fact. In any case where a hearing is conducted pursuant to this section, the hearing shall be based on written evidence only, and the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be on the licensee. Unless the licensee substantially prevails in the hearing, the Commission may assess the licensee for the costs of such hearing. Any Commission order adopted pursuant to this subsection shall determine the amount due, if any, and provide the licensee with at least 30 days to pay that amount or have its authorization revoked. No order of revocation under this subsection shall become final until the licensee has exhausted its right to judicial review of such order under section 402(b)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver, reduction, and deferment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may waive, reduce, or defer payment of a fee in any specific instance for good cause shown, where such action would promote the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit of collections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Moneys received from fees established under this section shall be deposited as an offsetting collection in, and credited to, the account providing appropriations to carry out the functions of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Installment payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such rules and regulations shall permit payment by installments in the case of fees in large amounts, and in the case of fees in small amounts, shall require the payment of the fee in advance for a number of years not to exceed the term of the license held by the payor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until amended by the Commission pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Schedule of Regulatory Fees which the Federal Communications Commission shall, subject to subsection (a)(2) of this section, assess and collect shall be as follows:</p>

If the Commission determines that such forbearance will promote competition among providers of telecommunications services, that determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that forbearance is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petition for forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any telecommunications carrier, or class of telecommunications carriers, may submit a petition to the Commission requesting that the Commission exercise the authority granted under this section with respect to that carrier or those carriers, or any service offered by that carrier or carriers. Any such petition shall be deemed granted if the Commission does not deny the petition for failure to meet the requirements for forbearance under subsection (a) of this section within one year after the Commission receives it, unless the one-year period is extended by the Commission. The Commission may extend the initial one-year period by an additional 90 days if the Commission finds that an extension is necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (a) of this section. The Commission may grant or deny a petition in whole or in part and shall explain its decision in writing.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Whenever there is filed with the Commission any new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice, the Commission may either upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, upon reasonable notice, enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness thereof; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the Commission, upon delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such charge, classification, regulation, or practice, in whole or in part but not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; and after full hearing the Commission may make such order with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding initiated after such charge, classification, regulation, or practice had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of the suspension, the proposed new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall go into effect at the end of such period; but in case of a proposed charge for a new service or a revised charge, the Commission may by order require the interested carrier or carriers to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of such charge for a new service or revised charge, specifying by whom and in whose behalf such amounts are paid, and upon completion of the hearing and decision may by further order require the interested carrier or carriers to refund, with interest, to the persons in whose behalf such amounts were paid, such portion of such charge for a new service or revised charges as by its decision shall be found not justified. At any hearing involving a new or revised charge, or a proposed new or revised charge, the burden of proof to show that the new or revised charge, or proposed charge, is just and reasonable shall be upon the carrier, and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such ques<!-- PDFPage:50 -->tions preference over all other questions pending before it and decide the same as speedily as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Commission shall, with respect to any hearing under this section, issue an order concluding such hearing within 5 months after the date that the charge, classification, regulation, or practice subject to the hearing becomes effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commission shall, with respect to any such hearing initiated prior to November 3, 1988, issue an order concluding the hearing not later than 12 months after November 3, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any order concluding a hearing under this section shall be a final order and may be appealed under section 402(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A local exchange carrier may file with the Commission a new or revised charge, classification, regulation, or practice on a streamlined basis. Any such charge, classification, regulation, or practice shall be deemed lawful and shall be effective 7 days (in the case of a reduction in rates) or 15 days (in the case of an increase in rates) after the date on which it is filed with the Commission unless the Commission takes action under paragraph (1) before the end of that 7-day or 15-day period, as is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Commission may allow part of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice to go into effect, based upon a written showing by the carrier or carriers affected, and an opportunity for written comment thereon by affected persons, that such partial authorization is just, fair, and reasonable. Additionally, or in combination with a partial authorization, the Commission, upon a similar showing, may allow all or part of a charge, classification, regulation, or practice to go into effect on a temporary basis pending further order of the Commission. Authorizations of temporary new or increased charges may include an accounting order of the type provided for in subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may from time to time, as may be necessary for the proper administration of this chapter, and after opportunity for hearing, make a valuation of all or of any part of the property owned or used by any carrier subject to this chapter, as of such date as the Commission may fix.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inventory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may at any time require any such carrier to file with the Commission an inventory of all or of any part of the property owned or used by said carrier, which inventory shall show the units of said property classified in such detail, and in such manner, as the Commission shall direct, and shall show the estimated cost of reproduction new of said units, and their reproduction cost new less depreciation, as of such date as the Commission may direct; and such carrier shall file such inventory within such reasonable time as the Commission by order shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Original cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may at any time require any such carrier to file with the Commission a statement showing the original cost at the time of dedication to the public use of all or of any part of the property owned or used by said carrier. For the showing of such original cost said property shall be classified, and the original cost shall be defined, in such manner as the Commission may prescribe; and if any part of such cost cannot be determined from accounting or other records, the portion of the property for which such cost cannot be determined shall be reported to the Commission; and, if the Commission shall so direct, the original cost thereof shall be estimated in such manner as the Commission may prescribe. If the carrier owning the property at the time such original cost is reported shall have paid more or less than the original cost to acquire the same, the amount of such cost of acquisition, and any facts which the Commission may require in connection therewith, shall be reported with such original cost. The report made by a carrier under this subsection shall show the source or sources from which the original cost reported was obtained, and such other information as to the manner in which the report was prepared, as the Commission shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Easement, license or franchise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing shall be included in the original cost reported for the property of any carrier under <!-- PDFPage:53 -->subsection (c) of this section on account of any easement, license, or franchise granted by the United States or by any State or political subdivision thereof, beyond the reasonable necessary expense lawfully incurred in obtaining such easement, license, or franchise from the public authority aforesaid, which expense shall be reported separately from all other costs in such detail as the Commission may require; and nothing shall be included in any valuation of the property of any carrier made by the Commission on account of any such easement, license, or franchise, beyond such reasonable necessary expense lawfully incurred as aforesaid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Improvements; changes in condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall keep itself informed of all new construction, extensions, improvements, retirements, or other changes in the condition, quantity, use, and classification of the property of common carriers, and of the cost of all additions and betterments thereto and of all changes in the investment therein, and may keep itself informed of current changes in costs and values of carrier properties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional information; access to records and data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of enabling the Commission to make a valuation of any of the property of any such carrier, or to find the original cost of such property, or to find any other facts concerning the same which are required for use by the Commission, it shall be the duty of each such carrier to furnish to the Commission, within such reasonable time as the Commission may order, any information with respect thereto which the Commission may by order require, including copies of maps, contracts, reports of engineers, and other data, records, and papers, and to grant to all agents of the Commission free access to its property and its accounts, records, and memoranda whenever and wherever requested by any such duly authorized agent, and to cooperate with and aid the Commission in the work of making any such valuation or finding in such manner and to such extent as the Commission may require and direct, and all rules and regulations made by the Commission for the purpose of administering this section shall have the full force and effect of law. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, with the reasons therefor, the records and data of the Commission shall be open to the inspection and examination of the public. The Commission, in making any such valuation, shall be free to adopt any method of valuation which shall be lawful.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;214. Extension of lines or discontinuance of service; certificate of public convenience and necessity</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exceptions; temporary or emergency service or discontinuance of service; changes in plant, operation or equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No carrier shall undertake the construction of a new line or of an extension of any line, or shall acquire or operate any line, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transmission over or by means of such additional or extended line, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line: <em>Provided</em>, That no such certificate shall be required under this section for the construction, acquisition, or operation of (1) a line within a single State unless such line constitutes part of an interstate line, (2) local, branch, or terminal lines not exceeding ten miles in length, or (3) any line acquired under section 221 of this title: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Commission may, upon appropriate request being made, authorize temporary or emergency service, or the supplementing of existing facilities, without regard to the provisions of this section. No carrier shall discontinue, reduce, or impair service to a community, or part of a community, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that neither the present nor future public convenience and necessity will be adversely affected thereby; except that the Commission may, upon appropriate request being made, authorize temporary or emergency discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, or partial discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, without regard to the provisions of this section. As used in this section the term &ldquo;line&rdquo; means any channel of communication established by the use of appropriate equipment, other than a channel of communication established by the interconnection of two or more existing channels: <em>Provided, however</em>, That nothing in this section shall be construed to require a certificate or other authorization from the Commission for any installation, replacement, or other changes in plant, operation, or equipment, other than new construction, which will not impair the adequacy or quality of service provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification of Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and State Governor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon receipt of an application for any such certificate, the Commission shall cause notice thereof to be given to, and shall cause a copy of such application to be filed with, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State (with respect to such applications involving service to foreign points), and the Governor of each State in which such line is proposed to be constructed, extended, acquired, or operated, or in which such discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service is proposed, with the right to those noti<!-- PDFPage:54 -->fied to be heard; and the Commission may require such published notice as it shall determine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval or disapproval; injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall have power to issue such certificate as applied for, or to refuse to issue it, or to issue it for a portion or portions of a line, or extension thereof, or discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service, described in the application, or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and may attach to the issuance of the certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require. After issuance of such certificate, and not before, the carrier may, without securing approval other than such certificate, comply with the terms and conditions contained in or attached to the issuance of such certificate and proceed with the construction, extension, acquisition, operation, or discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service covered thereby. Any construction, extension, acquisition, operation, discontinuance, reduction, or impairment of service contrary to the provisions of this section may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction at the suit of the United States, the Commission, the State commission, any State affected, or any party in interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Order of Commission; hearing; penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, after full opportunity for hearing, in a proceeding upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, authorize or require by order any carrier, party to such proceeding, to provide itself with adequate facilities for the expeditious and efficient performance of its service as a common carrier and to extend its line or to establish a public office; but no such authorization or order shall be made unless the Commission finds, as to such provision of facilities, as to such establishment of public offices, or as to such extension, that it is reasonably required in the interest of public convenience and necessity, or as to such extension or facilities that the expense involved therein will not impair the ability of the carrier to perform its duty to the public. Any carrier which refuses or neglects to comply with any order of the Commission made in pursuance of this subsection shall forfeit to the United States $1,200 for each day during which such refusal or neglect continues.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Provision of universal service</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible telecommunications carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier under paragraph (2), (3), or (6) shall be eligible to receive universal service support in accordance with section 254 of this title and shall, throughout the service area for which the designation is received&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of this title, either using its own facilities or a combination of its own facilities and resale of another carrier's services (including the services offered by another eligible telecommunications carrier); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) advertise the availability of such services and the charges therefor using media of general distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission shall upon its own motion or upon request designate a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the State commission. Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the State commission may, in the case of an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the State commission, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the State commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Designation of eligible telecommunications carriers for unserved areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If no common carrier will provide the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms under section 254(c) of this title to an unserved community or any portion thereof that requests such service, the Commission, with respect to interstate services or an area served by a common carrier to which paragraph (6) applies, or a State commission, with respect to intrastate services, shall determine which common carrier or carriers are best able to provide such service to the requesting unserved community or portion thereof and shall order such carrier or carriers to provide such service for that unserved community or portion thereof. Any carrier or carriers ordered to provide such service under this paragraph shall meet the requirements of paragraph (1) and shall be designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier for that community or portion thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Relinquishment of universal service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall permit an eligible telecommunications carrier to relinquish its designation as such a carrier in any area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier. An eligible telecommunications carrier that seeks to relinquish its eligible telecommunications carrier designation for an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier shall give advance notice to the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) of such relinquishment. Prior to permitting a telecommunications carrier designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier to cease providing universal service in an area served by more than one eligible telecommunications carrier, the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier des<!-- PDFPage:55 -->ignated under paragraph (6)) shall require the remaining eligible telecommunications carrier or carriers to ensure that all customers served by the relinquishing carrier will continue to be served, and shall require sufficient notice to permit the purchase or construction of adequate facilities by any remaining eligible telecommunications carrier. The State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall establish a time, not to exceed one year after the State commission (or the Commission in the case of a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) approves such relinquishment under this paragraph, within which such purchase or construction shall be completed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Service area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;service area&rdquo; means a geographic area established by a State commission (or the Commission under paragraph (6)) for the purpose of determining universal service obligations and support mechanisms. In the case of an area served by a rural telephone company, &ldquo;service area&rdquo; means such company's &ldquo;study area&rdquo; unless and until the Commission and the States, after taking into account recommendations of a Federal-State Joint Board instituted under section 410(c) of this title, establish a different definition of service area for such company.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Common carriers not subject to State commission jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a common carrier providing telephone exchange service and exchange access that is not subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission, the Commission shall upon request designate such a common carrier that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated by the Commission consistent with applicable Federal and State law. Upon request and consistent with the public interest, convenience and necessity, the Commission may, with respect to an area served by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the case of all other areas, designate more than one common carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier for a service area designated under this paragraph, so long as each additional requesting carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating an additional eligible telecommunications carrier for an area served by a rural telephone company, the Commission shall find that the designation is in the public interest.</p>

While so employed or engaged in conducting an audit for the Commission under this section, any such person shall have the powers granted the Commission under this subsection and shall be subject to subsection (f) of this section in the same manner as if that person were an employee of the Commission.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of other forms; alterations in prescribed forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the Commission has prescribed the forms and manner of keeping of accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by any person as herein provided, it shall be unlawful for such person to keep any other accounts, records, or memoranda than those so prescribed or such as may be approved by the Commission or to keep the accounts in any other manner than that prescribed or approved by the Commission.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation or knowing distribution of communications that violate this section, or who knowingly advertises the availability of such communications.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The term &ldquo;utility&rdquo; means any person who is a local exchange carrier or an electric, gas, water, steam, or other public utility, and who owns or controls poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way used, in whole or in part, for any wire communications. Such term does not include any railroad, any person who is cooperatively organized, or any person owned by the Federal Government or any State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The term &ldquo;Federal Government&rdquo; means the Government of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The term &ldquo;pole attachment&rdquo; means any attachment by a cable television system or provider of telecommunications service to a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by a utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;telecommunications carrier&rdquo; (as defined in section 153 of this title) does not include any incumbent local exchange carrier as defined in section 251(h) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of Commission to regulate rates, terms, and conditions; enforcement powers; promulgation of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments to provide that such rates, terms, and conditions are just and reasonable, and shall adopt procedures necessary and appropriate to hear and resolve complaints concerning such rates, terms, and conditions. For purposes of enforcing any determinations resulting from complaint procedures established pursuant to this subsection, the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate and necessary, including issuing cease and desist orders, as authorized by section 312(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall prescribe by rule regulations to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State regulatory authority over rates, terms, and conditions; preemption; certification; circumstances constituting State regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to, or to give the Commission jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms, and conditions, or access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way as provided in subsection (f) of this section, for pole attachments in any case where such matters are regulated by a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each State which regulates the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments shall certify to the Commission that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it regulates such rates, terms, and conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in so regulating such rates, terms, and conditions, the State has the authority to consider and does consider the interests of the subscribers of the services offered via such attachments, as well as the interests of the consumers of the utility services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, a State shall not be considered to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions for pole attachments&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) unless the State has issued and made effective rules and regulations implementing the State's regulatory authority over pole attachments; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:65 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to any individual matter, unless the State takes final action on a complaint regarding such matter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) within 180 days after the complaint is filed with the State, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) within the applicable period prescribed for such final action in such rules and regulations of the State, if the prescribed period does not extend beyond 360 days after the filing of such complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of just and reasonable rates; &ldquo;usable space&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subsection (b) of this section, a rate is just and reasonable if it assures a utility the recovery of not less than the additional costs of providing pole attachments, nor more than an amount determined by multiplying the percentage of the total usable space, or the percentage of the total duct or conduit capacity, which is occupied by the pole attachment by the sum of the operating expenses and actual capital costs of the utility attributable to the entire pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;usable space&rdquo; means the space above the minimum grade level which can be used for the attachment of wires, cables, and associated equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable television system solely to provide cable service. Until the effective date of the regulations required under subsection (e) of this section, this subsection shall also apply to the rate for any pole attachment used by a cable system or any telecommunications carrier (to the extent such carrier is not a party to a pole attachment agreement) to provide any telecommunications service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations governing charges; apportionment of costs of providing space</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall, no later than 2 years after February 8, 1996, prescribe regulations in accordance with this subsection to govern the charges for pole attachments used by telecommunications carriers to provide telecommunications services, when the parties fail to resolve a dispute over such charges. Such regulations shall ensure that a utility charges just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates for pole attachments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing space on a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way other than the usable space among entities so that such apportionment equals two-thirds of the costs of providing space other than the usable space that would be allocated to such entity under an equal apportionment of such costs among all attaching entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A utility shall apportion the cost of providing usable space among all entities according to the percentage of usable space required for each entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The regulations required under paragraph (1) shall become effective 5 years after February 8, 1996. Any increase in the rates for pole attachments that result from the adoption of the regulations required by this subsection shall be phased in equal annual increments over a period of 5 years beginning on the effective date of such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nondiscriminatory access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A utility shall provide a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier with nondiscriminatory access to any pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way owned or controlled by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a utility providing electric service may deny a cable television system or any telecommunications carrier access to its poles, ducts, conduits, or rights-of-way, on a non-discriminatory&nbsp;<sup><a href="#224_1_target" name="224_1">1</a></sup> basis where there is insufficient capacity and for reasons of safety, reliability and generally applicable engineering purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Imputation to costs of pole attachment rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A utility that engages in the provision of telecommunications services or cable services shall impute to its costs of providing such services (and charge any affiliate, subsidiary, or associate company engaged in the provision of such services) an equal amount to the pole attachment rate for which such company would be liable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Modification or alteration of pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the owner of a pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way intends to modify or alter such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way, the owner shall provide written notification of such action to any entity that has obtained an attachment to such conduit or right-of-way so that such entity may have a reasonable opportunity to add to or modify its existing attachment. Any entity that adds to or modifies its existing attachment after receiving such notification shall bear a proportionate share of the costs incurred by the owner in making such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way accessible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Costs of rearranging or replacing attachment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An entity that obtains an attachment to a pole, conduit, or right-of-way shall not be required to bear any of the costs of rearranging or replacing its attachment, if such rearrangement or replacement is required as a result of an additional attachment or the modification of an existing attachment sought by any other entity (including the owner of such pole, duct, conduit, or right-of-way).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Common carrier or carrier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; or &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; includes any common carrier engaged in interstate communication by wire or radio as defined in section 153 of this title and any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication by wire or radio, notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) TDD</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;TDD&rdquo; means a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, which is a machine that employs graphic communication in the transmission of coded signals through a wire or radio communication system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Telecommunications relay services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;telecommunications relay services&rdquo; means telephone transmission services that provide the ability for an individual who has a hearing impairment or speech impairment to engage in communication by wire or radio with a hearing individual in a manner that is functionally equivalent to the ability of an individual who does not have a hearing impairment or speech impairment to communicate using voice communication services by wire or radio. Such term includes services that enable two-way communication between an individual who uses a TDD or other nonvoice terminal device and an individual who does not use such a device.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of telecommunications relay services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to carry out the purposes established under section 151 of this title, to make available to all individuals in the United States a rapid, efficient nationwide communication service, and to increase the utility of the telephone system of the Nation, the Commission shall ensure that interstate and intrastate telecommunications relay services are available, to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner, to hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of general authority and remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purposes of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder, the Commission shall have the same authority, power, and functions with respect to common carriers engaged in intrastate communication as the Commission has in administering and enforcing the provisions of this subchapter with respect to any common carrier engaged in interstate communication. Any violation of this section by any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication shall be subject to the same remedies, penalties, and procedures as are applicable to a violation of this chapter by a common carrier engaged in interstate communication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each common carrier providing telephone voice transmission services shall, not later than 3 years after July 26, 1990, provide in compliance with the regulations prescribed under this section, throughout the area in which it offers service, telecommunications relay services, individually, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or in concert with other carriers. A common carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with such regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that does not have a certified program under subsection (f) of this section and with respect to interstate telecommunications relay services, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the Commission's regulations under subsection (d) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services in any State that has a certified program under subsection (f) of this section for such State, if such common carrier (or other entity through which the carrier is providing such relay services) is in compliance with the program certified under subsection (f) of this section for such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, not later than 1 year after July 26, 1990, prescribe regulations to implement this section, including regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish functional requirements, guidelines, and operations procedures for telecommunications relay services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish minimum standards that shall be met in carrying out subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:67 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) require that telecommunications relay services operate every day for 24 hours per day;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) require that users of telecommunications relay services pay rates no greater than the rates paid for functionally equivalent voice communication services with respect to such factors as the duration of the call, the time of day, and the distance from point of origination to point of termination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) prohibit relay operators from failing to fulfill the obligations of common carriers by refusing calls or limiting the length of calls that use telecommunications relay services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prohibit relay operators from disclosing the content of any relayed conversation and from keeping records of the content of any such conversation beyond the duration of the call; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) prohibit relay operators from intentionally altering a relayed conversation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall ensure that regulations prescribed to implement this section encourage, consistent with section 157(a) of this title, the use of existing technology and do not discourage or impair the development of improved technology.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Jurisdictional separation of costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Consistent with the provisions of section 410 of this title, the Commission shall prescribe regulations governing the jurisdictional separation of costs for the services provided pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Recovering costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such regulations shall generally provide that costs caused by interstate telecommunications relay services shall be recovered from all subscribers for every interstate service and costs caused by intrastate telecommunications relay services shall be recovered from the intrastate jurisdiction. In a State that has a certified program under subsection (f) of this section, a State commission shall permit a common carrier to recover the costs incurred in providing intrastate telecommunications relay services by a method consistent with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, the Commission shall enforce this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall resolve, by final order, a complaint alleging a violation of this section within 180 days after the date such complaint is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Certification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any State desiring to establish a State program under this section shall submit documentation to the Commission that describes the program of such State for implementing intrastate telecommunications relay services and the procedures and remedies available for enforcing any requirements imposed by the State program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements for certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After review of such documentation, the Commission shall certify the State program if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the program makes available to hearing-impaired and speech-impaired individuals, either directly, through designees, through a competitively selected vendor, or through regulation of intrastate common carriers, intrastate telecommunications relay services in such State in a manner that meets or exceeds the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the program makes available adequate procedures and remedies for enforcing the requirements of the State program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Method of funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the Commission shall not refuse to certify a State program based solely on the method such State will implement for funding intrastate telecommunication relay services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Suspension or revocation of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission may suspend or revoke such certification if, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission determines that such certification is no longer warranted. In a State whose program has been suspended or revoked, the Commission shall take such steps as may be necessary, consistent with this section, to ensure continuity of telecommunications relay services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Complaint</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Referral of complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a complaint to the Commission alleges a violation of this section with respect to intrastate telecommunications relay services within a State and certification of the program of such State under subsection (f) of this section is in effect, the Commission shall refer such complaint to such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After referring a complaint to a State under paragraph (1), the Commission shall exercise jurisdiction over such complaint only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) final action under such State program has not been taken on such complaint by such State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) within 180 days after the complaint is filed with such State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) within a shorter period as prescribed by the regulations of such State; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Commission determines that such State program is no longer qualified for certification under subsection (f) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of State law or regulation</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;435 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the divestiture of AT&T and decisions allowing open entry for competitors in the telephone market<!-- PDFPage:71 -->place produced a variety of new services and many new providers of existing telephone services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the growth of competition in the telecommunications market makes it essential to ensure that safeguards are in place to assure fairness for consumers and service providers alike;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) a variety of providers of operator services now compete to win contracts to provide operator services to hotels, hospitals, airports, and other aggregators of telephone business from consumers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the mere existence of a variety of service providers in the operator services marketplace is significant in making that market competitive only when consumers are able to make informed choices from among those service providers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) however, often consumers have no choices in selecting a provider of operator services, and often attempts by consumers to reach their preferred long distance carrier by using a telephone billing card, credit card, or prearranged access code number are blocked;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a number of State regulatory authorities have taken action to protect consumers using intrastate operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) from January 1988 through February 1990, the Federal Communications Commission received over 4,000 complaints from consumers about operator services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) those consumers have complained that they are denied access to the interexchange carrier of their choice, that they are deceived about the identity of the company providing operator services for their calls and the rates being charged, that they lack information on what they can do to complain about unfair treatment by an operator service provider, and that they are, accordingly, being deprived of the free choice essential to the operation of a competitive market;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the Commission has testified that its actions have been insufficient to correct the problems in the operator services industry to date; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) a combination of industry self-regulation and government regulation is required to ensure that competitive operator services are provided in a fair and reasonable manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of subscriber privacy rights</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Rulemaking proceeding required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers&rsquo; privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object. The proceeding shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures (including the use of electronic databases, telephone network technologies, special directory markings, industry-based or company-specific &ldquo;do not call&rdquo; systems, and any other alternatives, individually or in combination) for their effectiveness in protecting such privacy rights, and in terms of their cost and other advantages and disadvantages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) evaluate the categories of public and private entities that would have the capacity to establish and administer such methods and procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider whether different methods and procedures may apply for local telephone solicitations, such as local telephone solicitations of small businesses or holders of second class mail permits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consider whether there is a need for additional Commission authority to further restrict telephone solicitations, including those calls exempted under subsection (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a finding is made and supported by the record, propose specific restrictions to the Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) develop proposed regulations to implement the methods and procedures that the Commission determines are most effective and efficient to accomplish the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall conclude the rulemaking proceeding initiated under paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights described in such paragraph in an efficient, effective, and economic manner and without the imposition of any additional charge to telephone subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of database permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the establishment and operation of a single national database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that compiled list and parts thereof available for purchase. If the Commission determines to require such a database, such regulations shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) specify a method by which the Commission will select an entity to administer such database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require each common carrier providing telephone exchange service, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to inform subscribers for telephone exchange service of the opportunity to provide notification, in accordance with regulations established under this paragraph, that such subscriber objects to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) specify the methods by which each telephone subscriber shall be informed, by the common carrier that provides local exchange service to that subscriber, of (i) the subscriber's right to give or revoke a notification of an objection under subparagraph (A), and (ii) the methods by which such right may be exercised by the subscriber;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) specify the methods by which such objections shall be collected and added to the database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) prohibit any residential subscriber from being charged for giving or revoking such notification or for being included in a database compiled under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) prohibit any person from making or transmitting a telephone solicitation to the telephone number of any subscriber included in such database;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring to make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain access to the database, by area code or local exchange prefix, as required to avoid calling the telephone numbers of subscribers included in such database; and (ii) the costs to be recovered from such persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) specify the methods for recovering, from persons accessing such database, the costs involved in identifying, collecting, updating, disseminating, and selling, and other activities relating to, the operations of the database that are incurred by the entities carrying out those activities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:73 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) specify the frequency with which such database will be updated and specify the method by which such updating will take effect for purposes of compliance with the regulations prescribed under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) be designed to enable States to use the database mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of administering or enforcing State law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) prohibit the use of such database for any purpose other than compliance with the requirements of this section and any such State law and specify methods for protection of the privacy rights of persons whose numbers are included in such database; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) require each common carrier providing services to any person for the purpose of making telephone solicitations to notify such person of the requirements of this section and the regulations thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Considerations required for use of database method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines to require the database mechanism described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the database, consider the different needs of telemarketers conducting business on a national, regional, State, or local level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for recouping the cost of such database that recognizes such differences and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) reflect the relative costs of providing a national, regional, State, or local list of phone numbers of subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reflect the relative costs of providing such lists on paper or electronic media; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) not place an unreasonable financial burden on small businesses; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers operating on a local basis could be met through special markings of area white pages directories, and (ii) if such directories are needed as an adjunct to database lists prepared by area code and local exchange prefix.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Private right of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State bring in an appropriate court of that State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an action based on a violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) both such actions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">It shall be an affirmative defense in any action brought under this paragraph that the defendant has established and implemented, with due care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively prevent telephone solicitations in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Relation to subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to permit a communication prohibited by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Technical and procedural standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to initiate any communication using a telephone facsimile machine, or to make any telephone call using any automatic telephone dialing system, that does not comply with the technical and procedural standards prescribed under this subsection, or to use any telephone facsimile machine or automatic telephone dialing system in a manner that does not comply with such standards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to use a computer or other electronic device to send any message via a telephone facsimile machine unless such person clearly marks, in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page of the message or on the first page of the transmission, the date and time it is sent and an identification of the business, other entity, or individual sending the message and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Telephone facsimile machines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall revise the regulations setting technical and procedural standards for telephone facsimile machines to require that any such machine which is manufactured after one year after December 20, 1991, clearly marks, in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted page or on the first page of each transmission, the date and time sent, an identification of the business, other entity, or individual sending the message, and the telephone number of the sending machine or of such business, other entity, or individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Artificial or prerecorded voice systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prescribe technical and procedural standards for systems that are used to transmit any artificial or prerecorded voice message via telephone. Such standards shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) all artificial or prerecorded telephone messages (i) shall, at the beginning of the message, state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity initiating the call, and (ii) shall, during or after the message, state clearly the telephone number or address of such business, other entity, or individual; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any such system will automatically release the called party's line within 5 seconds of the time notification is transmitted to the system that the called party has hung <!-- PDFPage:74 -->up, to allow the called party's line to be used to make or receive other calls.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect on State law</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State law not preempted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except for the standards prescribed under subsection (d) of this section and subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, nothing in this section or in the regulations prescribed under this section shall preempt any State law that imposes more restrictive intrastate requirements or regulations on, or which prohibits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the use of telephone facsimile machines or other electronic devices to send unsolicited advertisements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the use of automatic telephone dialing systems;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Actions by States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority of States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency designated by a State, has reason to believe that any person has engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of telephone calls or other transmissions to residents of that State in violation of this section or the regulations prescribed under this section, the State may bring a civil action on behalf of its residents to enjoin such calls, an action to recover for actual monetary loss or receive $500 in damages for each violation, or both such actions. If the court finds the defendant willfully or knowingly violated such regulations, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusive jurisdiction of Federal courts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The district courts of the United States, the United States courts of any territory, and the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all civil actions brought under this subsection. Upon proper application, such courts shall also have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, or orders affording like relief, commanding the defendant to comply with the provisions of this section or regulations prescribed under this section, including the requirement that the defendant take such action as is necessary to remove the danger of such violation. Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Rights of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State shall serve prior written notice of any such civil action upon the Commission and provide the Commission with a copy of its complaint, except in any case where such prior notice is not feasible, in which case the State shall serve such notice immediately upon instituting such action. The Commission shall have the right (A) to intervene in the action, (B) upon so intervening, to be heard on all matters arising therein, and (C) to file petitions for appeal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Venue; service of process</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Investigatory powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of bringing any civil action under this subsection, nothing in this section shall prevent the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency designated by a State, from exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general or such official by the laws of such State to conduct investigations or to administer oaths or affirmations or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary and other evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Effect on State court proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit an authorized State official from proceeding in State court on the basis of an alleged violation of any general civil or criminal statute of such State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Commission has instituted a civil action for violation of regulations prescribed under this section, no State may, during the pendency of such action instituted by the Commission, subsequently institute a civil action against any defendant named in the Commission's complaint for any violation as alleged in the Commission's complaint.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) &ldquo;Attorney general&rdquo; defined</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Statement of Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Pub. L. 102&ndash;243 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The use of the telephone to market goods and services to the home and other businesses is now pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Over 30,000 businesses actively telemarket goods and services to business and residential customers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) More than 300,000 solicitors call more than 18,000,000 Americans every day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Total United States sales generated through telemarketing amounted to $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold increase since 1984.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Unrestricted telemarketing, however, can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and, when an emergency or medical assistance telephone line is seized, a risk to public safety.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Over half the States now have statutes restricting various uses of the telephone for marketing, but telemarketers can evade their prohibitions through interstate operations; therefore, Federal law is needed to control residential telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Constitution does not prohibit restrictions on commercial telemarketing solicitations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Individuals&rsquo; privacy rights, public safety interests, and commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telemarketing practices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that residential telephone subscribers consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Technologies that might allow consumers to avoid receiving such calls are not universally available, are costly, are unlikely to be enforced, or place an inordinate burden on the consumer.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) While the evidence presented to the Congress indicates that automated or prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy, regardless of the type of call, the Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to design different rules for those types of automated or prerecorded calls that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of privacy, or for noncommercial calls, consistent with the free speech protections embodied in the First Amendment of the Constitution.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Businesses also have complained to the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission that automated or prerecorded telephone calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and interfere with interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The Federal Communications Commission should consider adopting reasonable restrictions on automated or prerecorded calls to businesses as well as to the home, consistent with the constitutional protections of free speech.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;228. Regulation of carrier offering of pay-per-call services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to put into effect a system of national regulation and review that will oversee interstate pay-per-call services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to recognize the Commission's authority to prescribe regulations and enforcement procedures and conduct oversight to afford reasonable protection to consumers of pay-per-call services and to assure that violations of Federal law do not occur.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General authority for regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission by regulation shall, within 270 days after October 28, 1992, establish a system for oversight and regulation of pay-per-call services in order to provide for the protection of consumers in accordance with this chapter and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations. The Commission's final rules shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) include measures that provide a consumer of pay-per-call services with adequate and clear descriptions of the rights of the caller;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) define the obligations of common carriers with respect to the provision of pay-per-call services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include requirements on such carriers to protect against abusive practices by providers of pay-per-call services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) identify procedures by which common carriers and providers of pay-per-call services may take affirmative steps to protect against nonpayment of legitimate charges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) require that any service described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (i)(1) of this section be offered only through the use of certain telephone number prefixes and area codes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Common carrier obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 270 days after October 28, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish the following requirements for common carriers:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Contractual obligations to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any common carrier assigning to a provider of pay-per-call services a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section shall require by contract or tariff that such provider comply with the provisions of titles II and III of the Telephone <!-- PDFPage:76 -->Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.; 5721 et seq.] and the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to those titles.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Information availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that by tariff or contract assigns a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider of a pay-per-call service shall make readily available on request to Federal and State agencies and other interested persons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a list of the telephone numbers for each of the pay-per-call services it carries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a short description of each such service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a statement of the total cost or the cost per minute and any other fees for each such service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a statement of the pay-per-call service's name, business address, and business telephone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such other information as the Commission considers necessary for the enforcement of this section and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Compliance procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that by contract or tariff assigns a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider of pay-per-call services shall terminate, in accordance with procedures specified in such regulations, the offering of a pay-per-call service of a provider if the carrier knows or reasonably should know that such service is not provided in compliance with title II or III of the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act [15 U.S.C. 5711 et seq.; 5721 et seq.] or the regulations prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to such titles.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Subscriber disconnection prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier shall not disconnect or interrupt a subscriber's local exchange telephone service or long distance telephone service because of nonpayment of charges for any pay-per-call service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Blocking and presubscription</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that provides local exchange service shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer telephone subscribers (where technically feasible) the option of blocking access from their telephone number to all, or to certain specific, prefixes or area codes used by pay-per-call services, which option&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be offered at no charge (I) to all subscribers for a period of 60 days after the issuance of the regulations under subsection (b) of this section, and (II) to any subscriber who subscribes to a new telephone number until 60 days after the time the new telephone number is effective; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall otherwise be offered at a reasonable fee; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) offer telephone subscribers (where the Commission determines it is technically and economically feasible), in combination with the blocking option described under subparagraph (A), the option of presubscribing to or blocking only specific pay-per-call services for a reasonable one-time charge.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A)(i) of this paragraph may permit the costs of such blocking to be recovered by contract or tariff, but such costs may not be recovered from local or long-distance ratepayers. Nothing in this subsection precludes a common carrier from filing its rates and regulations regarding blocking and presubscription in its interstate tariffs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Verification of charitable status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier that assigns by contract or tariff a telephone number with a prefix or area code designated by the Commission in accordance with subsection (b)(5) of this section to a provider of pay-per-call services that the carrier knows or reasonably should know is engaged in soliciting charitable contributions shall obtain from such provider proof of the tax exempt status of any person or organization for which contributions are solicited.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Billing for 800 calls</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A common carrier shall prohibit by tariff or contract the use of any 800 telephone number, or other telephone number advertised or widely understood to be toll free, in a manner that would result in&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and other interactive computer services available to individual Americans represent an extraordinary advance in the availability of educational and informational resources to our citizens.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) These services offer users a great degree of control over the information that they receive, as well as the potential for even greater control in the future as technology develops.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Increasingly Americans are relying on interactive media for a variety of political, educational, cultural, and entertainment services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to promote the continued development of the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received by individuals, families, and schools who use the Internet and other interactive computer services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children's access to objectionable or inappropriate online material; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of computer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection for &ldquo;Good Samaritan&rdquo; blocking and screening of offensive material</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A provider of interactive computer service shall, at the time of entering an agreement with a customer for the provision of interactive computer service and in a manner deemed appropriate by the provider, notify such customer that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist the customer in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Such notice shall identify, or provide the customer with access to information identifying, current providers of such protections.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State regulatory authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall affect the ability of a State to impose, on a competitively neutral basis and consistent with section 254 of this title, requirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service, protect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State and local government authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section affects the authority of a State or local government to manage the public rights-of-way or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, for use of public rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preemption</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures to review universal service requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal-State Joint Board on universal service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within one month after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall institute and refer to a Federal-State Joint Board under section 410(c) of this title a proceeding to recommend changes to any of its regulations in order to implement sections 214(e) of this title and this section, including the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms and a specific timetable for completion of such recommendations. In addition to the members of the Joint Board required under section 410(c) of this title, one member of such Joint Board shall be a State-appointed utility consumer advocate nominated by a national organization of State utility consumer advocates. The Joint Board shall, after notice and opportunity for public comment, make its recommendations to the Commission 9 months after February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall initiate a single proceeding to implement the recommendations from the Joint Board required by paragraph (1) and shall complete such proceeding within 15 months after February 8, 1996. The rules established by such proceeding shall include a definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms and a specific timetable for implementation. Thereafter, the Commission shall complete <!-- PDFPage:90 -->any proceeding to implement subsequent recommendations from any Joint Board on universal service within one year after receiving such recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Universal service principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Joint Board and the Commission shall base policies for the preservation and advancement of universal service on the following principles:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quality and rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Quality services should be available at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Access to advanced services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Access to advanced telecommunications and information services should be provided in all regions of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Access in rural and high cost areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consumers in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and high cost areas, should have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services and advanced telecommunications and information services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All providers of telecommunications services should make an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There should be specific, predictable and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Access to advanced telecommunications services for schools, health care, and libraries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should have access to advanced telecommunications services as described in subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Additional principles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such other principles as the Joint Board and the Commission determine are necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Universal service is an evolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission shall establish periodically under this section, taking into account advances in telecommunications and information technologies and services. The Joint Board in recommending, and the Commission in establishing, the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms shall consider the extent to which such telecommunications services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are essential to education, public health, or public safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have, through the operation of market choices by customers, been subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are being deployed in public telecommunications networks by telecommunications carriers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) are consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alterations and modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Joint Board may, from time to time, recommend to the Commission modifications in the definition of the services that are supported by Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the services included in the definition of universal service under paragraph (1), the Commission may designate additional services for such support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and health care providers for the purposes of subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service. The Commission may exempt a carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if the carrier's telecommunications activities are limited to such an extent that the level of such carrier's contribution to the preservation and advancement of universal service would be de minimis. Any other provider of interstate telecommunications may be required to contribute to the preservation and advancement of universal service if the public interest so requires.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Universal service support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the date on which Commission regulations implementing this section take effect, only an eligible telecommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal universal service support. A carrier that receives such support shall use that support only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. Any such support should be explicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with the Commission's rules to preserve and advance universal service. Every telecommunications carrier that provides intrastate telecommunications services shall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the preservation and advancement of universal service in that State. A State may adopt regulations to provide for additional definitions and standards to preserve and advance universal service within that State only to the extent that such regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, and <!-- PDFPage:91 -->sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or standards that do not rely on or burden Federal universal service support mechanisms.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interexchange and interstate services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged by providers of interexchange telecommunications services to subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be no higher than the rates charged by each such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. Such rules shall also require that a provider of interstate interexchange telecommunications services shall provide such services to its subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the rates charged to its subscribers in any other State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Telecommunications services for certain providers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Health care providers for rural areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiving a bona fide request, provide telecommunications services which are necessary for the provision of health care services in a State, including instruction relating to such services, to any public or nonprofit health care provider that serves persons who reside in rural areas in that State at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall be entitled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the rates for services provided to health care providers for rural areas in a State and the rates for similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas in that State treated as a service obligation as a part of its obligation to participate in the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Educational providers and libraries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">All telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal service under subsection (c)(3) of this section, provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to other parties. The discount shall be an amount that the Commission, with respect to interstate services, and the States, with respect to intrastate services, determine is appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable access to and use of such services by such entities. A telecommunications carrier providing service under this paragraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have an amount equal to the amount of the discount treated as an offset to its obligation to contribute to the mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (e) of this section, receive reimbursement utilizing the support mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advanced services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall establish competitively neutral rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to enhance, to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable, access to advanced telecommunications and information services for all public and nonprofit elementary and secondary school classrooms, health care providers, and libraries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to define the circumstances under which a telecommunications carrier may be required to connect its network to such public institutional telecommunications users.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Telecommunications services and network capacity provided to a public institutional telecommunications user under this subsection may not be sold, resold, or otherwise transferred by such user in consideration for money or any other thing of value.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Eligibility of users</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No entity listed in this subsection shall be entitled to preferential rates or treatment as required by this subsection, if such entity operates as a for-profit business, is a school described in paragraph (7)(A) with an endowment of more than $50,000,000, or is a library or library consortium not eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act [20 U.S.C. 9121 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Requirements for certain schools with computers having Internet access</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Internet safety</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (ii), an elementary or secondary school having computers with Internet access may not receive services at discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) unless the school, school board, local educational agency, or other authority with responsibility for administration of the school&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) submits to the Commission the certifications described in subparagraphs (B) and (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) submits to the Commission a certification that an Internet safety policy has been adopted and implemented for the school under subsection (<em>l</em>) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) ensures the use of such computers in accordance with the certifications.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The prohibition in clause (i) shall not apply with respect to a school that receives services at discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) only for purposes other than the provision of Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Public notice; hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An elementary or secondary school described in clause (i), or the school board, <!-- PDFPage:92 -->local educational agency, or other authority with responsibility for administration of the school, shall provide reasonable public notice and hold at least one public hearing or meeting to address the proposed Internet safety policy. In the case of an elementary or secondary school other than an elementary or secondary school as defined in section 8801&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254_1_target" name="254_1">1</a></sup> of title 20, the notice and hearing required by this clause may be limited to those members of the public with a relationship to the school.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In-region State</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">We live in a time when the technology of telecommunications is undergoing rapid change which will dramatically affect the whole of our society. It has long been recognized that the executive branch of the Federal government should be better equipped to deal with the issues which arise from telecommunications growth. As the largest single user of the nation's telecommunications facilities, the Federal government must also manage its internal communications operations in the most effective manner possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">That plan would establish a new Office of Telecommunications Policy in the Executive Office of the President. The new unit would be headed by a Director and a Deputy Director who would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The existing office held by the Director of Telecommunications Management in the Office of Emergency Preparedness would be abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to the functions which are transferred to it by the reorganization plan, the new Office would perform certain other duties which I intend to assign to it by Executive order as soon as the reorganization plan takes effect. That order would delegate to the new Office essentially those functions which are now assigned to the Director of Telecommunications Management. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would be assisted in its research and analysis responsibilities by the agencies and departments of the Executive Branch including another new office, located in the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office of Telecommunications Policy would play three essential roles:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. It would serve as the President's principal adviser on telecommunications policy, helping to formulate government policies concerning a wide range of domestic and international telecommunications issues and helping to develop plans and programs which take full advantage of the nation's technological capabilities. The speed of economic and technological advance in our time means that new questions concerning communications are constantly arising, questions on which the government must be well informed and well advised. The new Office will enable the President and all government officials to share more fully in the experience, the insights, and the forecasts of government and non-government experts.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would help formulate policies and coordinate operations for the Federal government's own vast communications systems. It would, for example, set guidelines for the various departments and agencies concerning their communications equipment and services. It would regularly review the ability of government communications systems to meet the security needs of the nation and to perform effectively in time of emergency. The Office would direct the assignment of those portions of the radio spectrum which are reserved for government use, carry out responsibilities conferred on the President by the Communications Satellite Act, advise State and local governments, and provide policy direction for the National Communications System.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Finally, the new Office would enable the executive branch to speak with a clearer vote and to act as a more effective partner in discussions of communications policy with both the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. This action would take away none of the prerogatives or functions assigned to the Federal Communications Commission by the Congress. It is my hope, however, that the new Office and the Federal Communications Commission would cooperate in achieving certain reforms in telecommunications policy, especially in their procedures for allocating portions of the radio spectrum for government and civilian use. Our current procedures must be more flexible if they are to deal adequately with problems such as the worsening spectrum shortage.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of <!-- PDFPage:122 -->title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), &ldquo;to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;&rdquo; and section 901(a)(3), &ldquo;to increase the efficiency of the operations of the government to the fullest extent practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan should result in the more efficient operation of the government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.</p>
<p class="note-body">The public interest requires that government policies concerning telecommunications be formulated with as much sophistication and vision as possible. This reorganization plan&mdash;and the executive order which would follow it&mdash;are necessary instruments if the government is to respond adequately to the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid pace of change in communications. I urge that the Congress allow this plan to become effective so that these necessary reforms can be accomplished.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation of facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In considering applications for licenses, and modifications and renewals thereof, when and insofar as there is demand for the same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same.</p>

Consistent with the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the Commission may by rule prescribe the period or periods for which licenses shall be granted and renewed for particular classes of stations, but the Commission may not adopt or follow any rule which would preclude it, in any case involving a station of a particular class, from granting or renewing a license for a shorter period than that prescribed for stations of such class if, in its judgment, the public interest, convenience, or necessity would be served by such action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Materials in application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to expedite action on applications for renewal of broadcasting station licenses and in order to avoid needless expense to applicants for such renewals, the Commission shall not require any such applicant to file any information which previously has been furnished to the Commission or which is not directly material to the considerations that affect the granting or denial of such application, but the Commission may require any new or additional facts it deems necessary to make its findings.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Continuation pending decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending any administrative or judicial hearing and final decision on such an application and the disposition of any petition for rehearing pursuant to section 405 or section 402 of this title, the Commission shall continue such license in effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Renewals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No renewal of an existing station license in the broadcast or the common carrier services shall be granted more than thirty days prior to the expiration of the original license.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Operation of certain radio stations without individual licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any license requirement established in this chapter, if the Commission determines that such authorization serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the <!-- PDFPage:126 -->Commission may by rule authorize the operation of radio stations without individual licenses in the following radio services: (A) the citizens band radio service; (B) the radio control service; (C) the aviation radio service for aircraft stations operated on domestic flights when such aircraft are not otherwise required to carry a radio station; and (D) the maritime radio service for ship stations navigated on domestic voyages when such ships are not otherwise required to carry a radio station.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;195, &sect;2, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 715, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in 1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum management principles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other advanced communications services. The Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The study being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation with the Department of Defense to determine whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other advanced communications services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the process of determining how to resolve the interference problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been conceived.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most productive use.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Commission's rules governing voluntary mechanisms for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services any earlier than the existing statutory framework provides; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) should advance the transition of digital television and must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent licensee.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Compliance With Auction Authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;195, &sect;4, June 19, 2002, 116 Stat. 717, provided that: &ldquo;The Federal Communications Commission shall conduct rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 prior to the expiration of the auction authority under section 309(j)(11) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)(11)).&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Answers by satellite carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within five business days after the date of service, the satellite carrier shall file an answer with the Commission and shall serve the answer by a commonly used overnight delivery service and by United States mail, on the counsel designated in the complaint at the address listed for such counsel in the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Defenses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Exclusive defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The defenses under this paragraph are the exclusive defenses available to a satellite carrier against which a complaint under this subsection is filed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Defenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The defenses referred to under subparagraph (A) are the defenses that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the satellite carrier did not retransmit the television broadcast station to any person in the local market of the station during the time period specified in the complaint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the television broadcast station had, in a writing signed by an officer of the television broadcast station, expressly authorized the retransmission of the station by the satellite carrier to each person in the local market of the television broadcast station to which the satellite carrier made such retransmissions for the entire time period during which it is alleged that a violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section has occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the retransmission was made after January 1, 2002, and the television broadcast station had elected to assert the right to carriage under section 338 of this title as against the satellite carrier for the relevant period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the station being retransmitted is a noncommercial television broadcast station.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Counting of violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The retransmission without consent of a particular television broadcast station on a particular day to one or more persons in the local market of the station shall be considered a separate violation of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Burden of proof</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to each alleged violation, the burden of proof shall be on a television broadcast station to establish that the satellite carrier retransmitted the station to at least one person in the local market of the station on the day in question. The burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Procedures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall issue procedural regulations implementing this subsection which shall supersede procedures under section 312 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Within 45 days after the filing of a complaint, the Commission shall issue a final determination in any proceeding brought under this subsection. The Commission's final determination shall specify the number of violations committed by the satellite carrier. The Commission shall hear witnesses only if it clearly appears, based on written filings by the parties, that there is a genuine dispute about material facts. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Commission may issue a final ruling based on written filings by the parties.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Discovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Commission may direct the parties to exchange pertinent documents, and if necessary to take prehearing depositions, on such schedule as the Commission may approve, but only if the Commission first determines that such discovery is necessary to resolve a genuine dispute about material facts, consistent with the obligation to make a final determination within 45 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission determines that a satellite carrier has retransmitted the television broadcast station to at least one person in the local market of such station and has failed to meet its burden of proving one of the defenses under paragraph (4) with respect to such retransmission, the Commission shall be required to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make a finding that the satellite carrier violated subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to that station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) issue an order, within 45 days after the filing of the complaint, containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a cease-and-desist order directing the satellite carrier immediately to stop making any further retransmissions of the television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station until such time as the Commission determines that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to such station;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the satellite carrier is found to have violated subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to more than two television broadcast stations, a cease-and-de<!-- PDFPage:152 -->sist order directing the satellite carrier to stop making any further retransmission of any television broadcast station to any person within the local market of such station, until such time as the Commission, after giving notice to the station, that the satellite carrier is in compliance with subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to such stations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an award to the complainant of that complainant's costs and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Court proceedings on enforcement of Commission order</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On entry by the Commission of a final order granting relief under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a television broadcast station may apply within 30 days after such entry to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a final judgment enforcing all relief granted by the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the satellite carrier may apply within 30 days after such entry to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia for a judgment reversing the Commission's order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The procedure for an appeal under this paragraph by the satellite carrier shall supersede any other appeal rights under Federal or State law. A United States district court shall be deemed to have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier if the carrier, or a company under common control with the satellite carrier, has delivered television programming by satellite to more than 30 customers in that district during the preceding 4-year period. If the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia does not have personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier, an enforcement action or appeal shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which may find personal jurisdiction based on the satellite carrier's ownership of licenses issued by the Commission. An application by a television broadcast station for an order enforcing any cease-and-desist relief granted by the Commission shall be resolved on a highly expedited schedule. No discovery may be conducted by the parties in any such proceeding. The district court shall enforce the Commission order unless the Commission record reflects manifest error and an abuse of discretion by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Civil action for statutory damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after issuance of an order by the Commission under this subsection, a television broadcast station may file a civil action in any United States district court that has personal jurisdiction over the satellite carrier for an award of statutory damages for any violation that the Commission has determined to have been committed by a satellite carrier under this subsection. Such action shall not be subject to transfer under section 1404(a) of title 28. On finding that the satellite carrier has committed one or more violations of subsection (b) of this section, the District Court shall be required to award the television broadcast station statutory damages of $25,000 per violation, in accordance with paragraph (5), and the costs and attorney's fees incurred by the station. Such statutory damages shall be awarded only if the television broadcast station has filed a binding stipulation with the court that such station will donate the full amount in excess of $1,000 of any statutory damage award to the United States Treasury for public purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a station shall incur no tax liability of any kind with respect to any amounts so donated. Discovery may be conducted by the parties in any proceeding under this paragraph only if and to the extent necessary to resolve a genuinely disputed issue of fact concerning one of the defenses under paragraph (4). In any such action, the defenses under paragraph (4) shall be exclusive, and the burden of proof shall be on the satellite carrier with respect to all defenses other than the defense under paragraph (4)(B)(i). A judgment under this paragraph may be enforced in any manner permissible under Federal or State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Appeals</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The nonprevailing party before a United States district court may appeal a decision under this subsection to the United States Court of Appeals with jurisdiction over that district court. The Court of Appeals shall not issue any stay of the effectiveness of any decision granting relief against a satellite carrier unless the carrier presents clear and convincing evidence that it is highly likely to prevail on appeal and only after posting a bond for the full amount of any monetary award assessed against it and for such further amount as the Court of Appeals may believe appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Commission denies relief in response to a complaint filed by a television broadcast station under this subsection, the television broadcast station filing the complaint may file an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(12) Sunset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No complaint or civil action may be filed under this subsection after December 31, 2001. This subsection shall continue to apply to any complaint or civil action filed on or before such date.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;332. Mobile services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Factors which Commission must consider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In taking actions to manage the spectrum to be made available for use by the private mobile services, the Commission shall consider, consistent with section 151 of this title, whether such actions will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote the safety of life and property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) improve the efficiency of spectrum use and reduce the regulatory burden upon spec<!-- PDFPage:156 -->trum users, based upon sound engineering principles, user operational requirements, and marketplace demands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage competition and provide services to the largest feasible number of users; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) increase interservice sharing opportunities between private mobile services and other services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Advisory coordinating committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission, in coordinating the assignment of frequencies to stations in the private mobile services and in the fixed services (as defined by the Commission by rule), shall have authority to utilize assistance furnished by advisory coordinating committees consisting of individuals who are not officers or employees of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority of the Commission established in this subsection shall not be subject to or affected by the provisions of part III of title 5 or section 1342 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person who provides assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be considered, by reason of having provided such assistance, a Federal employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any advisory coordinating committee which furnishes assistance to the Commission under this subsection shall not be subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulatory treatment of mobile services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Common carrier treatment of commercial mobile services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a commercial mobile service shall, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for purposes of this chapter, except for such provisions of subchapter II of this chapter as the Commission may specify by regulation as inapplicable to that service or person. In prescribing or amending any such regulation, the Commission may not specify any provision of section 201, 202, or 208 of this title, and may specify any other provision only if the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) enforcement of such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practices, classifications, or regulations for or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) enforcement of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) specifying such provision is consistent with the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Upon reasonable request of any person providing commercial mobile service, the Commission shall order a common carrier to establish physical connections with such service pursuant to the provisions of section 201 of this title. Except to the extent that the Commission is required to respond to such a request, this subparagraph shall not be construed as a limitation or expansion of the Commission's authority to order interconnection pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission shall review competitive market conditions with respect to commercial mobile services and shall include in its annual report an analysis of those conditions. Such analysis shall include an identification of the number of competitors in various commercial mobile services, an analysis of whether or not there is effective competition, an analysis of whether any of such competitors have a dominant share of the market for such services, and a statement of whether additional providers or classes of providers in those services would be likely to enhance competition. As a part of making a determination with respect to the public interest under subparagraph (A)(iii), the Commission shall consider whether the proposed regulation (or amendment thereof) will promote competitive market conditions, including the extent to which such regulation (or amendment) will enhance competition among providers of commercial mobile services. If the Commission determines that such regulation (or amendment) will promote competition among providers of commercial mobile services, such determination may be the basis for a Commission finding that such regulation (or amendment) is in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The Commission shall, not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993, complete a rulemaking required to implement this paragraph with respect to the licensing of personal communications services, including making any determinations required by subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Non-common carrier treatment of private mobile services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of a service that is a private mobile service shall not, insofar as such person is so engaged, be treated as a common carrier for any purpose under this chapter. A common carrier (other than a person that was treated as a provider of a private land mobile service prior to August 10, 1993) shall not provide any dispatch service on any frequency allocated for common carrier service, except to the extent such dispatch service is provided on stations licensed in the domestic public land mobile radio service before January 1, 1982. The Commission may by regulation terminate, in whole or in part, the prohibition contained in the preceding sentence if the Commission determines that such termination will serve the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding sections 152(b) and 221(b) of this title, no State or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service, except that this paragraph shall not prohibit a State from regulating the other terms and conditions of commercial mobile services. Nothing in this subparagraph shall exempt providers of commercial mobile services (where such services are a substitute for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the communications within such State) from requirements imposed by a State commission on all providers of telecommunications services necessary to ensure the universal availability of telecommunications service at affordable rates. Notwith<!-- PDFPage:157 -->standing the first sentence of this subparagraph, a State may petition the Commission for authority to regulate the rates for any commercial mobile service and the Commission shall grant such petition if such State demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) market conditions with respect to such services fail to protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such market conditions exist and such service is a replacement for land line telephone exchange service for a substantial portion of the telephone land line exchange service within such State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition. If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such periods of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a State has in effect on June 1, 1993, any regulation concerning the rates for any commercial mobile service offered in such State on such date, such State may, no later than 1 year after August 10, 1993, petition the Commission requesting that the State be authorized to continue exercising authority over such rates. If a State files such a petition, the State's existing regulation shall, notwithstanding subparagraph (A), remain in effect until the Commission completes all action (including any reconsideration) on such petition. The Commission shall review such petition in accordance with the procedures established in such subparagraph, shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) within 12 months after such petition is filed, and shall grant such petition if the State satisfies the showing required under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii). If the Commission grants such petition, the Commission shall authorize the State to exercise under State law such authority over rates, for such period of time, as the Commission deems necessary to ensure that such rates are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. After a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Commission, has elapsed from the issuance of an order under subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph, any interested party may petition the Commission for an order that the exercise of authority by a State pursuant to such subparagraph is no longer necessary to ensure that the rates for commercial mobile services are just and reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission shall provide reasonable opportunity for public comment in response to such petition, and shall, within 9 months after the date of its submission, grant or deny such petition in whole or in part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulatory treatment of communications satellite corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter or affect the regulatory treatment required by title IV of the Communications Satellite Act of 1962 [47 U.S.C. 741 et seq.] of the corporation authorized by title III of such Act [47 U.S.C. 731 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Space segment capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from continuing to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite systems to providers of commercial mobile services shall be treated as common carriage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Foreign ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission, upon a petition for waiver filed within 6 months after August 10, 1993, may waive the application of section 310(b) of this title to any foreign ownership that lawfully existed before May 24, 1993, of any provider of a private land mobile service that will be treated as a common carrier as a result of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, but only upon the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The extent of foreign ownership interest shall not be increased above the extent which existed on May 24, 1993.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such waiver shall not permit the subsequent transfer of ownership to any other person in violation of section 310(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Preservation of local zoning authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The regulation of the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities by any State or local government or instrumentality thereof&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A State or local government or instrumentality thereof shall act on any request for authorization to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with such government or instrumentality, taking into account the nature and scope of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Any decision by a State or local government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:158 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) No State or local government or instrumentality thereof may regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the Commission's regulations concerning such emissions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) Any person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court shall hear and decide such action on an expedited basis. Any person adversely affected by an act or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with clause (iv) may petition the Commission for relief.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &ldquo;personal wireless services&rdquo; means commercial mobile services, unlicensed wireless services, and common carrier wireless exchange access services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the term &ldquo;personal wireless service facilities&rdquo; means facilities for the provision of personal wireless services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the term &ldquo;unlicensed wireless service&rdquo; means the offering of telecommunications services using duly authorized devices which do not require individual licenses, but does not mean the provision of direct-to-home satellite services (as defined in section 303(v) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Mobile services access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person engaged in the provision of commercial mobile services, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not be required to provide equal access to common carriers for the provision of telephone toll services. If the Commission determines that subscribers to such services are denied access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&rsquo; choice, and that such denial is contrary to the public interest, convenience, and necessity, then the Commission shall prescribe regulations to afford subscribers unblocked access to the provider of telephone toll services of the subscribers&rsquo; choice through the use of a carrier identification code assigned to such provider or other mechanism. The requirements for unblocking shall not apply to mobile satellite services unless the Commission finds it to be in the public interest to apply such requirements to such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;commercial mobile service&rdquo; means any mobile service (as defined in section 153 of this title) that is provided for profit and makes interconnected service available (A) to the public or (B) to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;interconnected service&rdquo; means service that is interconnected with the public switched network (as such terms are defined by regulation by the Commission) or service for which a request for interconnection is pending pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission determines to issue additional licenses for advanced television services, the Commission&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall adopt regulations that allow the holders of such licenses to offer such ancillary or supplementary services on designated frequencies as may be consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In prescribing the regulations required by subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) only permit such licensee or permittee to offer ancillary or supplementary services if the use of a designated frequency for such services is consistent with the technology or method designated by the Commission for the provision of advanced television services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If the Commission grants a license for advanced television services to a person that, as of the date of such issuance, is licensed to operate a television broadcast station or holds a permit to construct such a station (or both), the Commission shall, as a condition of such license, require that either the additional license or the original license held by the licensee be surrendered to the Commission for reallocation or reassignment (or both) pursuant to Commission regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Public interest requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed as relieving a television broadcasting station from its obligation to serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In the Commission's review of any application for renewal of a broad<!-- PDFPage:161 -->cast license for a television station that provides ancillary or supplementary services, the television licensee shall establish that all of its program services on the existing or advanced television spectrum are in the public interest.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Creation of class A licenses</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Rulemaking required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 120 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall prescribe regulations to establish a class A television license to be available to licensees of qualifying low-power television stations. Such regulations shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the license shall be subject to the same license terms and renewal standards as the licenses for full-power television stations except as provided in this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) each such class A licensee shall be accorded primary status as a television broadcaster as long as the station continues to meet the requirements for a qualifying low-power station in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice to and certification by licensees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 30 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall send a notice to the licensees of all low-power television licenses that describes the requirements for class A designation. Within 60 days after November 29, 1999, licensees intending to seek class A designation shall submit to the Commission a certification of eligibility based on the qualification requirements of this subsection. Absent a material deficiency, the Commission shall grant certification of eligibility to apply for class A status.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application for and award of licenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection, a licensee may submit an application for class A designation under this paragraph within 30 days after final regulations are adopted under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Except as provided in paragraphs (6) and (7), the Commission shall, within 30 days after receipt of an application of a licensee of a qualifying low-power television station that is acceptable for filing, award such a class A television station license to such licensee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Resolution of technical problems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall act to preserve the service areas of low-power television licensees pending the final resolution of a class A application. If, after granting certification of eligibility for a class A license, technical problems arise requiring an engineering solution to a full-power station's al<!-- PDFPage:162 -->lotted parameters or channel assignment in the digital television Table of Allotments, the Commission shall make such modifications as necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to ensure replication of the full-power digital television applicant's service area, as provided for in sections 73.622 and 73.623 of the Commission's regulations (47 CFR 73.622, 73.623); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">if such applicant has filed an application for maximization or a notice of its intent to seek such maximization by December 31, 1999, and filed a bona fide application for maximization by May 1, 2000. Any such applicant shall comply with all applicable Commission rules regarding the construction of digital television facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Change applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a station that is awarded a construction permit to maximize or significantly enhance its digital television service area, later files a change application to reduce its digital television service area, the protected contour of that station shall be reduced in accordance with such change modification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualifying low-power television stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a station is a qualifying low-power television station if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) during the 90 days preceding November 29, 1999&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) such station broadcast a minimum of 18 hours per day;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) such station broadcast an average of at least 3 hours per week of programming that was produced within the market area served by such station, or the market area served by a group of commonly controlled low-power stations that carry common local programming produced within the market area served by such group; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) such station was in compliance with the Commission's requirements applicable to low-power television stations; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) from and after the date of its application for a class A license, the station is in compliance with the Commission's operating rules for full-power television stations; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Common ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No low-power television station authorized as of November 29, 1999, shall be disqualified for a class A license based on common ownership with any other medium of mass communication.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Issuance of licenses for advanced television services to television translator stations and qualifying low-power television stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission is not required to issue any additional license for advanced television services to the licensee of a class A television station under this subsection, or to any licensee of any television translator station, but shall accept a license application for such services proposing facilities that will not cause interference to the service area of any other broadcast facility applied for, protected, permitted, or authorized on the date of filing of the advanced television application. Such new license or the original license of the applicant shall be forfeited after the end of the digital television service transition period, as determined by the Commission.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;338. Carriage of local television signals by satellite carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each satellite carrier providing, under section 122 of title 17, secondary transmissions to subscribers located within the local market of a television broadcast station of a primary transmission made by that station shall carry upon request the signals of all television broadcast stations located within that local market, subject to section 325(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Remedies for failure to carry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the remedies available to television broadcast stations under section 501(f) of title 17, the Commission may use the Commission's authority under this chapter to assure compliance with the obligations of this subsection, but in no instance shall a Commission enforcement proceeding be required as a predicate to the pursuit of a remedy available under such section 501(f).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#338_1_target" name="338_1">1</a></sup> Low power station carriage optional</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No low power television station whose signals are provided under section 119(a)(14) of <!-- PDFPage:168 -->title 17 shall be entitled to insist on carriage under this section, regardless of whether the satellite carrier provides secondary transmissions of the primary transmissions of other stations in the same local market pursuant to section 122 of such title, nor shall any such carriage be considered in connection with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#338_1_target" name="338_1">1</a></sup> Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No satellite carrier shall be required to carry local television broadcast stations under paragraph (1) until January 1, 2002.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Carriage of signals of local stations in certain markets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A satellite carrier that offers multichannel video programming distribution service in the United States to more than 5,000,000 subscribers shall (A) within 1 year after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as analog signals of each television broadcast station located in any local market within a State that is not part of the contiguous United States, and (B) within 30 months after December 8, 2004, retransmit the signals originating as digital signals of each such station. The retransmissions of such stations shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in each station's local market, and the retransmissions of the stations in at least one market in the State shall be made available to substantially all of the satellite carrier's subscribers in areas of the State that are not within a designated market area. The cost to subscribers of such retransmissions shall not exceed the cost of retransmissions of local television stations in other States. Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall promulgate regulations concerning elections by television stations in such State between mandatory carriage pursuant to this section and retransmission consent pursuant to section 325(b) of this title, which shall take into account the schedule on which local television stations are made available to viewers in such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Good signal required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A television broadcast station asserting its right to carriage under subsection (a) of this section shall be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the designated local receive facility of the satellite carrier or to another facility that is acceptable to at least one-half the stations asserting the right to carriage in the local market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under subsection (g) of this section shall set forth the obligations necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duplication not required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commercial stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, a satellite carrier shall not be required to carry upon request the signal of any local commercial television broadcast station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television broadcast station which is secondarily transmitted by the satellite carrier within the same local market, or to carry upon request the signals of more than one local commercial television broadcast station in a single local market that is affiliated with a particular television network unless such stations are licensed to communities in different States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noncommercial stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall prescribe regulations limiting the carriage requirements under subsection (a) of this section of satellite carriers with respect to the carriage of multiple local noncommercial television broadcast stations. To the extent possible, such regulations shall provide the same degree of carriage by satellite carriers of such multiple stations as is provided by cable systems under section 535 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No satellite carrier shall be required to provide the signal of a local television broadcast station to subscribers in that station's local market on any particular channel number or to provide the signals in any particular order, except that the satellite carrier shall retransmit the signal of the local television broadcast stations to subscribers in the stations&rsquo; local market on contiguous channels and provide access to such station's signals at a nondiscriminatory price and in a nondiscriminatory manner on any navigational device, on-screen program guide, or menu.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Compensation for carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A satellite carrier shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local television broadcast stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal to the local receive facility of the satellite carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaints by broadcast stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a local television broadcast station believes that a satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations under subsections (b) through (e) of this section, such station shall notify the carrier, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the satellite carrier failed to comply with such obligations. The satellite carrier shall, within 30 days after such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and comply with such obligations or state its reasons for believing that it is in compliance with such obligations. A local television broadcast station that disputes a response by a satellite carrier that it is in compliance with such obligations may obtain review of such denial or response by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such satellite carrier has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:169 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford the satellite carrier against which a complaint is filed under paragraph (1) an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed under paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether the satellite carrier has met its obligations under subsections (b) through (e) of this section. If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the satellite carrier to take appropriate remedial action. If the Commission determines that the satellite carrier has fully met the requirements of such subsections, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Carriage of local stations on a single dish</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Single dish</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each satellite carrier that retransmits the analog signals of local television broadcast stations in a local market shall retransmit such analog signals in such market by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the carrier retransmits signals in the digital television service, the carrier shall retransmit such digital signals in such market by means of a single reception antenna and associated equipment, but such antenna and associated equipment may be separate from the single reception antenna and associated equipment used for analog television service signals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall apply on and after 18 months after December 8, 2004.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice of disruptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A carrier that is providing signals of a local television broadcast station in a local market under this section on December 8, 2004, shall, not later than 15 months after December 8, 2004, provide to the licensees for such stations and the carrier's subscribers in such local market a notice that displays prominently and conspicuously a clear statement of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any reallocation of signals between different reception antennas and associated equipment that the carrier intends to make in order to comply with the requirements of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the need, if any, for subscribers to obtain an additional reception antenna and associated equipment to receive such signals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any cessation of carriage or other material change in the carriage of signals as a consequence of the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Additional notices to subscribers, networks, and stations concerning signal carriage</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 180 days after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall revise the regulations under this section relating to notice to broadcast station licensees to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Contents of commencement notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The notice required by such regulations shall inform each television broadcast station licensee within any local market in which a satellite carrier proposes to commence carriage of signals of stations from that market, not later than 60 days prior to the commencement of such carriage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) of the carrier's intention to launch local-into-local service under this section in a local market, the identity of that local market, and the location of the carrier's proposed local receive facility for that local market;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) of the right of such licensee to elect carriage under this section or grant retransmission consent under section 325(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) that such licensee has 30 days from the date of the receipt of such notice to make such election; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) that failure to make such election will result in the loss of the right to demand carriage under this section for the remainder of the 3-year cycle of carriage under section 325 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for retransmission</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study of digital strength testing procedures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Study required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry regarding whether, for purposes of identifying if a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under section 119(d)(10) of title 17, the digital signal strength standard in section 73.622(e)(1) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or the testing procedures in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, such statutes or regulations should be revised to take into account the types of antennas that are available to consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Study considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In conducting the study under this paragraph, the Commission shall consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to account for the fact that an antenna can be mounted on a roof or placed in a home and can be fixed or capable of rotating;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, should be amended to create different procedures for determining if the requisite digital signal strength is present than for determining if the requisite analog signal strength is present;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a standard should be used other than the presence of a signal of a certain strength to ensure that a household can receive a high-quality picture using antennas of reasonable cost and ease of installation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) to develop a predictive methodology for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal under section 119(d)(10) of title 17;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) there is a wide variation in the ability of reasonably priced consumer digital television sets to receive over-the-air signals, such that at a given signal strength some may be able to display high-quality pictures while others cannot, whether such variation is related to the price of the television set, and whether such variation should be factored into setting a standard for determining whether a household is unserved by an adequate digital signal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) to account for factors such as building loss, external interference sources, or undesired signals from both digital television and analog television stations using either the same or adjacent channels in nearby markets, foliage, and man-made clutter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Federal Communications Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the results of the study under this paragraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) recommendations, if any, as to what changes should be made to Federal statutes or regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Waivers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A subscriber who is denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119 of title 17 may request a waiver from such denial by submitting a request, through such subscriber's satellite carrier, to the network station asserting that the retransmission is prohibited. The network station shall accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within 30 days after receipt of the request. The subscriber shall be permitted to receive such retransmission under section 119(d)(10)(B) of title 17, if such station agrees to the waiver request and files with the satellite carrier a written waiver with respect to that subscriber allowing the subscriber to receive such retransmission. If a television network station fails to accept or reject a subscriber's request for a waiver within the 30-day <!-- PDFPage:177 -->period after receipt of the request, that station shall be deemed to agree to the waiver request and have filed such written waiver.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Establishment of improved predictive model required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after November 29, 1999, the Commission shall take all actions necessary, including any reconsideration, to develop and prescribe by rule a point-to-point predictive model for reliably and presumptively determining the ability of individual locations to receive signals in accordance with the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17. In prescribing such model, the Commission shall rely on the Individual Location Longley-Rice model set forth by the Federal Communications Commission in Docket No. 98&ndash;201 and ensure that such model takes into account terrain, building structures, and other land cover variations. The Commission shall establish procedures for the continued refinement in the application of the model by the use of additional data as it becomes available.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Objective verification</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a subscriber's request for a waiver under paragraph (2) is rejected and the subscriber submits to the subscriber's satellite carrier a request for a test verifying the subscriber's inability to receive a signal that meets the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited with respect to that subscriber shall select a qualified and independent person to conduct a test in accordance with section 73.686(d) of its regulations (47 CFR 73.686(d)), or any successor regulation. Such test shall be conducted within 30 days after the date the subscriber submits a request for the test. If the written findings and conclusions of a test conducted in accordance with such section (or any successor regulation) demonstrate that the subscriber does not receive a signal that meets or exceeds the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, the subscriber shall not be denied the retransmission of a signal of a network station under section 119 of title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Designation of tester and allocation of costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the satellite carrier and the network station or stations asserting that the retransmission is prohibited are unable to agree on such a person to conduct the test, the person shall be designated by an independent and neutral entity designated by the Commission by rule. Unless the satellite carrier and the network station or stations otherwise agree, the costs of conducting the test under this paragraph shall be borne by the satellite carrier, if the station's signal meets or exceeds the signal intensity standard in effect under section 119(d)(10)(A) of title 17, or by the network station, if its signal fails to meet or exceed such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Avoidance of undue burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Commission regulations prescribed under this paragraph shall seek to avoid any undue burden on any party.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Reduction of verification burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 1 year after December 8, 2004, the Commission shall by rule exempt from the verification requirements of subparagraph (A) any request for a test made by a subscriber to a satellite carrier to whom the retransmission of the signals of local broadcast stations is available under section 338 of this title from such carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A satellite carrier may refuse to engage in the testing process. If the carrier does so refuse, a subscriber in a local market in which the satellite carrier does not offer the signals of local broadcast stations under section 338 of this title may, at his or her own expense, authorize a signal intensity test to be performed pursuant to the procedures specified by the Commission in section 73.686(d) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, by a tester who is approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station, or who has been previously approved by the satellite carrier and by each affected network station but not previously disapproved. A tester may not be so disapproved for a test after the tester has commenced such test. The tester shall give 5 business days advance written notice to the satellite carrier and to the affected network station or stations. A signal intensity test conducted in accordance with this subparagraph shall be determinative of the signal strength received at that household for purposes of determining whether the household is capable of receiving a Grade B intensity signal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (d)(4) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;satellite carrier&rdquo; includes a distributor (as defined in section 119(d)(1) of title 17), but only if the satellite distributor's relationship with the subscriber includes billing, collection, service activation, and service deactivation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary is authorized and directed to enforce this subsection and to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall provide for close coordination with the Commission in the administration of the responsibilities of the Secretary under this subsection which are of interest to or affect the functions of the Commission so that, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the enforcement responsibilities of each, the reporting requirements of public telecommunications entities shall be uniformly based upon consistent definitions and categories of information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Corporation shall incorporate into each grant agreement or contract with any recipient entered into on or after the effective date of the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2)(A), a statement indicating that, as a material part of the terms and conditions of the grant agreement or contract, the recipient will comply with the provisions of paragraph (1) and the rules and regulations prescribed pursuant to paragraph (2)(A). Any person which desires to be a recipient (within the meaning of paragraph (1)) of funds under subpart C&nbsp;<sup><a href="#398_1_target" name="398_1">1</a></sup> shall, before receiving any such funds, provide to the Corporation any information which the Corporation may require to satisfy itself that such person is affording equal opportunity in employment in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. Determinations made by the Corporation in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be based upon guidelines relating to equal opportunity in employment which shall be established by rule by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Corporation is not satisfied that any such person is affording equal opportunity in employment in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, the Corporation shall notify the Secretary, and the Secretary shall review the matter and make a final determination regarding whether such person is affording equal opportunity in employment. In any case in which the Secretary conducts a review under the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall make funds available to the person involved pursuant to the grant application of such person (if the Corporation would have approved such application but for the finding of the Corporation under this paragraph) pending a final determination of the Secretary upon completion of such review. The Corporation shall monitor the equal employment opportunity practices of each recipient throughout the duration of the grant or contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The provisions of subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B) shall take effect on the effective date of the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>

A recipient whose funds have been reduced or suspended under this paragraph may apply at any time to the Secretary for such certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Control over content or distribution of programs</h4>

A petition for reconsideration must be filed within thirty days from the date upon which public notice is given of the order, decision, report, or action complained of. No such application shall excuse any person from complying with or obeying any order, decision, report, or action of the Commission, or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof, without the special order of the Commission.

<p class="statutory-body">In every case of adjudication (as defined in section 551 of title 5) which has been designated by the Commission for hearing, any party to the proceeding shall be permitted to file exceptions and memoranda in support thereof to the initial, tentative, or recommended decision, which shall be passed upon by the Commission or by the authority within the Commission, if any, to whom the function of passing upon the exceptions is delegated under section 155(d)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#409_1_target" name="409_1">1</a></sup> of this title: <!-- PDFPage:219 --><em>Provided, however</em>, That such authority shall not be the same authority which made the decision to which the exception is taken.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">To the extent that the foregoing provisions of this section and section 155(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#409_1_target" name="409_1">1</a></sup> of this title are in conflict with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5, such provisions of this section and section 155(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#409_1_target" name="409_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall be held to supersede and modify the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this chapter the Commission shall have the power to require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all books, papers, schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, and documents relating to any matter under investigation. Witnesses summoned before the Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Designated place of hearing; aid in enforcement of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such attendance of witnesses, and the production of such documentary evidence, may be required from any place in the United States, at any designated place of hearing. And in case of disobedience to a subpena the Commission, or any party to a proceeding before the Commission, may invoke the aid of any court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents under the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Contempts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any of the district courts of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena issued to any common carrier or licensee or other person, issue an order requiring such common carrier, licensee, or other person to appear before the Commission (and produce books and papers if so ordered) and give evidence touching the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Depositions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The testimony of any witness may be taken, at the instance of a party, in any proceeding or investigation pending before the Commission, by deposition, at any time after a cause or proceeding is at issue on petition and answer. The Commission may also order testimony to be taken by deposition in any proceeding or investigation pending before it, at any stage of such proceeding or investigation. Such depositions may be taken before any judge of any court of the United States, or any United States magistrate judge, or any clerk of a district court, or any chancellor, justice, or judge of a supreme or superior court, mayor, or chief magistrate of a city, judge of a county court, or court of common pleas of any of the United States, or any notary public, not being of counsel or attorney to either of the parties, nor interested in the event of the proceeding or investigation. Reasonable notice must first be given in writing by the party or his attorney proposing to take such deposition to the opposite party or his attorney of record, as either may be nearest, which notice shall state the name of the witness and the time and place of the taking of his deposition. Any person may be compelled to appear and depose, and to produce documentary evidence, in the same manner as witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify and produce documentary evidence before the Commission, as hereinbefore provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Oaths; testimony in writing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every person deposing as herein provided shall be cautioned and sworn (or affirm, if he so request) to testify the whole truth, and shall be carefully examined.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Foreign depositions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a witness whose testimony may be desired to be taken by deposition be in a foreign country, the deposition may be taken before an officer or person designated by the Commission, or agreed upon by the parties by stipulation in writing to be filed with the Commission. All depositions must be promptly filed with the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Deposition fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Witnesses whose depositions are taken as authorized in this chapter, and the magistrate or other officer taking the same, shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Policy for Pub. L. 102&ndash;385</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;385, &sect;2(a), (b), Oct. 5, 1992, 106 Stat. 1460, 1463, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 [Pub. L. 98&ndash;549, enacting this subchapter and section 611 of this title, amending sections 152, 224, 309, and 605 of this title, section 2511 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and section 1805 of Title 50, War and National Defense, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 543, 605, and 609 of this title], rates for cable television services have been deregulated in approximately 97 percent of all franchises since December 29, 1986. Since rate deregulation, monthly rates for the lowest priced basic cable service have increased by 40 percent or more for 28 percent of cable television subscribers. Although the average number of basic chan<!-- PDFPage:229 -->nels has increased from about 24 to 30, average monthly rates have increased by 29 percent during the same period. The average monthly cable rate has increased almost 3 times as much as the Consumer Price Index since rate deregulation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) For a variety of reasons, including local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area, most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to select between competing cable systems. Without the presence of another multichannel video programming distributor, a cable system faces no local competition. The result is undue market power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and video programmers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) There has been a substantial increase in the penetration of cable television systems over the past decade. Nearly 56,000,000 households, over 60 percent of the households with televisions, subscribe to cable television, and this percentage is almost certain to increase. As a result of this growth, the cable television industry has become a dominant nationwide video medium.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The cable industry has become highly concentrated. The potential effects of such concentration are barriers to entry for new programmers and a reduction in the number of media voices available to consumers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The cable industry has become vertically integrated; cable operators and cable programmers often have common ownership. As a result, cable operators have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated programmers. This could make it more difficult for noncable-affiliated programmers to secure carriage on cable systems. Vertically integrated program suppliers also have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated cable operators over nonaffiliated cable operators and programming distributors using other technologies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in promoting a diversity of views provided through multiple technology media.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in ensuring that cable subscribers have access to local noncommercial educational stations which Congress has authorized, as expressed in section 396(a)(5) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 396(a)(5)]. The distribution of unique noncommercial, educational programming services advances that interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in making all nonduplicative local public television services available on cable systems because&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) public television provides educational and informational programming to the Nation's citizens, thereby advancing the Government's compelling interest in educating its citizens;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) public television is a local community institution, supported through local tax dollars and voluntary citizen contributions in excess of $10,800,000,000 since 1972, that provides public service programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of the local community;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the Federal Government, in recognition of public television's integral role in serving the educational and informational needs of local communities, has invested more than $3,000,000,000 in public broadcasting since 1969; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) absent carriage requirements there is a substantial likelihood that citizens, who have supported local public television services, will be deprived of those services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in having cable systems carry the signals of local commercial television stations because the carriage of such signals is necessary to serve the goals contained in section 307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 307(b)] of providing a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of broadcast services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) A primary objective and benefit of our Nation's system of regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of programming. There is a substantial governmental interest in ensuring its continuation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Broadcast television stations continue to be an important source of local news and public affairs programming and other local broadcast services critical to an informed electorate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Broadcast television programming is supported by revenues generated from advertising broadcast over stations. Such programming is otherwise free to those who own television sets and do not require cable transmission to receive broadcast signals. There is a substantial governmental interest in promoting the continued availability of such free television programming, especially for viewers who are unable to afford other means of receiving programming.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) As a result of the growth of cable television, there has been a marked shift in market share from broadcast television to cable television services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Cable television systems and broadcast television stations increasingly compete for television advertising revenues. As the proportion of households subscribing to cable television increases, proportionately more advertising revenues will be reallocated from broadcast to cable television systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) A cable television system which carries the signal of a local television broadcaster is assisting the broadcaster to increase its viewership, and thereby attract additional advertising revenues that otherwise might be earned by the cable system operator. As a result, there is an economic incentive for cable systems to terminate the retransmission of the broadcast signal, refuse to carry new signals, or reposition a broadcast signal to a disadvantageous channel position. There is a substantial likelihood that absent the reimposition of such a requirement, additional local broadcast signals will be deleted, repositioned, or not carried.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) As a result of the economic incentive that cable systems have to delete, reposition, or not carry local broadcast signals, coupled with the absence of a requirement that such systems carry local broadcast signals, the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously jeopardized.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Consumers who subscribe to cable television often do so to obtain local broadcast signals which they otherwise would not be able to receive, or to obtain improved signals. Most subscribers to cable television systems do not or cannot maintain antennas to receive broadcast television services, do not have input selector switches to convert from a cable to antenna reception system, or cannot otherwise receive broadcast television services. The regulatory system created by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 was premised upon the continued existence of mandatory carriage obligations for cable systems, ensuring that local stations would be protected from anticompetitive conduct by cable systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Cable television systems often are the single most efficient distribution system for television programming. A Government mandate for a substantial societal investment in alternative distribution systems for cable subscribers, such as the &lsquo;A/B&rsquo; input selector antenna system, is not an enduring or feasible method of distribution and is not in the public interest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) At the same time, broadcast programming that is carried remains the most popular programming on cable systems, and a substantial portion of the benefits for which consumers pay cable systems is derived from carriage of the signals of network affiliates, independent television stations, and public television stations. Also cable programming placed on channels adjacent to popular off-the-air signals obtains a larger audience than on other channel positions. Cable systems, therefore, obtain great benefits <!-- PDFPage:230 -->from local broadcast signals which, until now, they have been able to obtain without the consent of the broadcaster or any copyright liability. This has resulted in an effective subsidy of the development of cable systems by local broadcasters. While at one time, when cable systems did not attempt to compete with local broadcasters for programming, audience, and advertising, this subsidy may have been appropriate, it is so no longer and results in a competitive imbalance between the 2 industries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, in its amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], limited the regulatory authority of franchising authorities over cable operators. Franchising authorities are finding it difficult under the current regulatory scheme to deny renewals to cable systems that are not adequately serving cable subscribers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) Cable systems should be encouraged to carry low-power television stations licensed to the communities served by those systems where the low-power station creates and broadcasts, as a substantial part of its programming day, local programming.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Statement of Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the policy of the Congress in this Act [enacting sections 334, 335, 534 to 537, 544a, 548, and 555a of this title, amending sections 325, 332, 522, 532, 533, 541 to 544, 546, 551 to 555, and 558 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 325, 531, 543, and 554 of this title] to&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;532. Cable channels for commercial use</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to promote competition in the delivery of diverse sources of video programming and to assure that the widest possible diversity of information sources are made available to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent with growth and development of cable systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of channel capacity for commercial use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A cable operator shall designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator in accordance with the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An operator of any cable system with 36 or more (but not more than 54) activated channels shall designate 10 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An operator of any cable system with 55 or more (but not more than 100) activated channels shall designate 15 percent of such channels which are not otherwise required for use (or the use of which is not prohibited) by Federal law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An operator of any cable system with more than 100 activated channels shall designate 15 percent of all such channels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) An operator of any cable system with fewer than 36 activated channels shall not be required to designate channel capacity for commercial use by persons unaffiliated with the operator, unless the cable system is required to provide such channel capacity under the terms of a franchise in effect on October 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) An operator of any cable system in operation on October 30, 1984, shall not be required to remove any service actually being provided on July 1, 1984, in order to comply with this section, but shall make channel capacity available for commercial use as such capacity becomes available until such time as the cable operator is in full compliance with this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not require any cable system to designate channel capacity for commercial use by unaffiliated persons in excess of the capacity specified in paragraph (1), except as otherwise provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A cable operator may not be required, as part of a request for proposals or as part of a proposal for renewal, subject to section 546 of this title, to designate channel capacity for any use (other than commercial use by unaffiliated persons under this section) except as provided in sections 531 and 557 of this title, but a cable operator may offer in a franchise, or proposal for renewal thereof, to provide, consistent with applicable law, such capacity for other than commercial use by such persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A cable operator may use any unused channel capacity designated pursuant to this section until the use of such channel capacity is obtained, pursuant to a written agreement, by a person unaffiliated with the operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;commercial use&rdquo; means the provision of video programming, whether or not for profit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any channel capacity which has been designated for public, educational, or governmental use may not be considered as designated under this section for commercial use for purpose of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:233 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of channel capacity by unaffiliated persons; editorial control; restriction on service; rules on rates, terms, and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a person unaffiliated with the cable operator seeks to use channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for commercial use, the cable operator shall establish, consistent with the purpose of this section and with rules prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (4), the price, terms, and conditions of such use which are at least sufficient to assure that such use will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cable operator shall not exercise any editorial control over any video programming provided pursuant to this section, or in any other way consider the content of such programming, except that a cable operator may refuse to transmit any leased access program or portion of a leased access program which contains obscenity, indecency, or nudity and may consider such content to the minimum extent necessary to establish a reasonable price for the commercial use of designated channel capacity by an unaffiliated person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any cable system channel designated in accordance with this section shall not be used to provide a cable service that is being provided over such system on October 30, 1984, if the provision of such programming is intended to avoid the purpose of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Commission shall have the authority to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) determine the maximum reasonable rates that a cable operator may establish pursuant to paragraph (1) for commercial use of designated channel capacity, including the rate charged for the billing of rates to subscribers and for the collection of revenue from subscribers by the cable operator for such use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) establish reasonable terms and conditions for such use, including those for billing and collection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) establish procedures for the expedited resolution of disputes concerning rates or carriage under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall establish rules for determining maximum reasonable rates under subparagraph (A)(i), for establishing terms and conditions under subparagraph (A)(ii), and for providing procedures under subparagraph (A)(iii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Right of action in district court; relief; factors not to be considered by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available for use pursuant to this section may bring an action in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the cable system is located to compel that such capacity be made available. If the court finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or finds that the price, terms, or conditions established by the cable operator are unreasonable, the court may order such system to make available to such person the channel capacity sought, and further determine the appropriate price, terms, or conditions for such use consistent with subsection (c) of this section, and may award actual damages if it deems such relief appropriate. In any such action, the court shall not consider any price, term, or condition established between an operator and an affiliate for comparable services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Petition to Commission; relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make channel capacity available pursuant to this section may petition the Commission for relief under this subsection upon a showing of prior adjudicated violations of this section. Records of previous adjudications resulting in a court determination that the operator has violated this section shall be considered as sufficient for the showing necessary under this subsection. If the Commission finds that the channel capacity sought by such person has not been made available in accordance with this section, or that the price, terms, or conditions established by such system are unreasonable under subsection (c) of this section, the Commission shall, by rule or order, require such operator to make available such channel capacity under price, terms, and conditions consistent with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by an operator, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that the operator provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the Commission finds that the prior adjudicated violations of this section constitute a pattern or practice of violations by any person who is an operator of more than one cable system, the Commission may also establish any further rule or order necessary to assure that such person provides the diversity of information sources required by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Presumption of reasonableness and good faith</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any action brought under this section in any Federal district court or before the Commission, there shall be a presumption that the price, terms, and conditions for use of channel capacity designated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section are reasonable and in good faith unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Promulgation of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding sections 541(c) and 543(a) of this title, at such time as cable systems with 36 or more activated channels are available to 70 percent of households within the United States and are subscribed to by 70 percent of the households to which such systems are available, the Commission may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources. Any rules promulgated by the Commission pursuant to this subsection shall not preempt authority expressly granted to franchising authorities under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Cable service unprotected by Constitution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any cable service offered pursuant to this section shall not be provided, or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable service in the <!-- PDFPage:234 -->judgment of the franchising authority or the cable operator is obscene, or is in conflict with community standards in that it is lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States. This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforce prospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the cable operator reasonably believes describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Programming from qualified minority or educational programming sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a cable operator required by this section to designate channel capacity for commercial use may use any such channel capacity for the provision of programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source, whether or not such source is affiliated with the cable operator. The channel capacity used to provide programming from a qualified minority programming source or from any qualified educational programming source pursuant to this subsection may not exceed 33 percent of the channel capacity designated pursuant to this section. No programming provided over a cable system on July 1, 1990, may qualify as minority programming or educational programming on that cable system under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified minority programming source&rdquo; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to coverage of minority viewpoints, or to programming directed at members of minority groups, and which is over 50 percent minority-owned, as the term &ldquo;minority&rdquo; is defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified educational programming source&rdquo; means a programming source which devotes substantially all of its programming to educational or instructional programming that promotes public understanding of mathematics, the sciences, the humanities, and the arts and has a documented annual expenditure on programming exceeding $15,000,000. The annual expenditure on programming means all annual costs incurred by the programming source to produce or acquire programs which are scheduled to be televised, and specifically excludes marketing, promotion, satellite transmission and operational costs, and general administrative costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall substitute for the requirements to carry qualified noncommercial educational television stations as specified under section 535 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Single channel access to indecent programming</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 120 days following October 5, 1992, the Commission shall promulgate regulations designed to limit the access of children to indecent programming, as defined by Commission regulations, and which cable operators have not voluntarily prohibited under subsection (h) of this section by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) requiring cable operators to place on a single channel all indecent programs, as identified by program providers, intended for carriage on channels designated for commercial use under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requiring cable operators to block such single channel unless the subscriber requests access to such channel in writing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) requiring programmers to inform cable operators if the program would be indecent as defined by Commission regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Cable operators shall comply with the regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may prescribe rules with respect to the ownership or control of cable systems by persons who own or control other media of mass communications which serve the same community served by a cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Regulation of ownership by States or franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State or franchising authority may not prohibit the ownership or control of a cable system by any person because of such person's ownership or control of any other media of mass communications or other media interests. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State or franchising authority from prohibiting the ownership or control of a cable system in a jurisdiction by any person (1) because of such person's ownership or control of any other cable system in such jurisdiction; or (2) in circumstances in which the State or franchising authority determines that the acquisition of such a cable system may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Holding of ownership interests or exercise of editorial control by States or franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a State or franchising authority may hold any ownership interest in any cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any State or franchising authority shall not exercise any editorial control regarding the content of any cable service on a cable system in which such governmental entity holds ownership interest (other than programming on any channel designated for educational or governmental use), unless such control is exercised through an entity separate from the franchising authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Enhancement of effective competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to enhance effective competition, the Commission shall, within one year after October 5, 1992, conduct a proceeding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through cable systems owned by such person, or in which such person has an attributable interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prescribe rules and regulations establishing reasonable limits on the number of channels on a cable system that can be occupied by a video programmer in which a cable operator has an attributable interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to consider the necessity and appropriateness of imposing limitations on the degree to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In prescribing rules and regulations under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, among other public interest objectives&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that no cable operator or group of cable operators can unfairly impede, either because of the size of any individual operator or because of joint actions by a group of operators of sufficient size, the flow of video programming from the video programmer to the consumer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ensure that cable operators affiliated with video programmers do not favor such programmers in determining carriage on their cable systems or do not unreasonably restrict the flow of the video programming of such programmers to other video distributors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take particular account of the market structure, ownership patterns, and other relationships of the cable television industry, including the nature and market power of the local franchise, the joint ownership of cable systems and video programmers, and the various types of non-equity controlling interests;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) make such rules and regulations reflect the dynamic nature of the communications marketplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) not impose limitations which would bar cable operators from serving previously unserved rural areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) not impose limitations which would impair the development of diverse and high quality video programming.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to prohibit any combination of any interests held by any person on July 1, 1984, to the extent of the interests so held as of such date, if the holding of such interests was not inconsistent with any applicable Federal or State law or regulations in effect on that date.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;534. Carriage of local commercial television signals</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Carriage obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cable operator shall carry, on the cable system of that operator, the signals of local commercial television stations and qualified low power stations as provided by this section. Carriage of additional broadcast television signals on such system shall be at the discretion of such operator, subject to section 325(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Signals required</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator of a cable system with 12 or fewer usable activated channels shall carry the signals of at least three local commercial television stations, except that if such a system has 300 or fewer subscribers, it shall not be subject to any requirements under this section so long as such system does not delete from carriage by that system any signal of a broadcast television station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A cable operator of a cable system with more than 12 usable activated channels shall carry the signals of local commercial television stations, up to one-third of the aggregate number of usable activated channels of such system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection of signals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the number of local commercial television stations exceeds the maximum number of signals a cable system is required to carry under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall have discretion in selecting which such stations shall be carried on its cable system, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under no circumstances shall a cable operator carry a qualified low power station in lieu of a local commercial television station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the cable operator elects to carry an affiliate of a broadcast network (as such term is defined by the Commission by regulation), such cable operator shall carry the affiliate of such broadcast network whose city of license reference point, as defined in section 76.53 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulation thereto, is closest to the principal headend of the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Content to be carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A cable operator shall carry in its entirety, on the cable system of that operator, the primary video, accompanying audio, and line 21 closed caption transmission of each of the local commercial television stations carried on the cable system and, to the extent technically feasible, program-related material carried in the vertical blanking interval or on subcarriers. Retransmission of other material in the vertical blanking internal or other nonprogram-related material (including teletext and other subscription and advertiser-supported information services) shall be at the discretion of the cable operator. Where appropriate and feasible, operators may delete signal enhancements, such as ghost-canceling, from the broadcast signal and employ such enhancements at the system headend or headends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The cable operator shall carry the entirety of the program schedule of any television station carried on the cable system unless carriage of specific programming is prohibited, and other programming authorized to be substituted, under section 76.67 or subpart F of part 76 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on January 1, 1991), or any successor regulations thereto.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Signal quality</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nondegradation; technical specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The signals of local commercial television stations that a cable operator carries shall be carried without material degradation. The Commission shall adopt carriage standards to ensure that, to the extent technically feasible, the quality of signal processing and carriage provided by a cable system for the carriage of local commercial television stations will be no less than that provided by the system for carriage of any other type of signal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Advanced television</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At such time as the Commission prescribes modifications of the standards for television broadcast signals, the Commission shall initiate a proceeding to establish any changes in the signal carriage requirements of cable television systems necessary to ensure cable carriage of such broadcast signals of local <!-- PDFPage:237 -->commercial television stations which have been changed to conform with such modified standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duplication not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a cable operator shall not be required to carry the signal of any local commercial television station that substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station which is carried on its cable system, or to carry the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network (as such term is defined by regulation). If a cable operator elects to carry on its cable system a signal which substantially duplicates the signal of another local commercial television station carried on the cable system, or to carry on its system the signals of more than one local commercial television station affiliated with a particular broadcast network, all such signals shall be counted toward the number of signals the operator is required to carry under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Channel positioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each signal carried in fulfillment of the carriage obligations of a cable operator under this section shall be carried on the cable system channel number on which the local commercial television station is broadcast over the air, or on the channel on which it was carried on July 19, 1985, or on the channel on which it was carried on January 1, 1992, at the election of the station, or on such other channel number as is mutually agreed upon by the station and the cable operator. Any dispute regarding the positioning of a local commercial television station shall be resolved by the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Signal availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section shall be provided to every subscriber of a cable system. Such signals shall be viewable via cable on all television receivers of a subscriber which are connected to a cable system by a cable operator or for which a cable operator provides a connection. If a cable operator authorizes subscribers to install additional receiver connections, but does not provide the subscriber with such connections, or with the equipment and materials for such connections, the operator shall notify such subscribers of all broadcast stations carried on the cable system which cannot be viewed via cable without a converter box and shall offer to sell or lease such a converter box to such subscribers at rates in accordance with section 543(b)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Identification of signals carried</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall identify, upon request by any person, the signals carried on its system in fulfillment of the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall provide written notice to a local commercial television station at least 30 days prior to either deleting from carriage or repositioning that station. No deletion or repositioning of a local commercial television station shall occur during a period in which major television ratings services measure the size of audiences of local television stations. The notification provisions of this paragraph shall not be used to undermine or evade the channel positioning or carriage requirements imposed upon cable operators under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Compensation for carriage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator shall not accept or request monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange either for carriage of local commercial television stations in fulfillment of the requirements of this section or for the channel positioning rights provided to such stations under this section, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any such station may be required to bear the costs associated with delivering a good quality signal or a baseband video signal to the principal headend of the cable system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator may accept payments from stations which would be considered distant signals under section 111 of title 17 as indemnification for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage of such signal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a cable operator may continue to accept monetary payment or other valuable consideration in exchange for carriage or channel positioning of the signal of any local commercial television station carried in fulfillment of the requirements of this section, through, but not beyond, the date of expiration of an agreement thereon between a cable operator and a local commercial television station entered into prior to June 26, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Low power station carriage obligation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there are not sufficient signals of full power local commercial television stations to fill the channels set aside under subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of 35 or fewer usable activated channels shall be required to carry one qualified low power station; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a cable operator of a cable system with a capacity of more than 35 usable activated channels shall be required to carry two qualified low power stations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of public, educational, or governmental channels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A cable operator required to carry more than one signal of a qualified low power station under this subsection may do so, subject to approval by the franchising authority pursuant to section 531 of this title, by placing such additional station on public, educational, or governmental channels not in use for their designated purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaints by broadcast stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a local commercial television station believes that a cable operator has failed to meet its obligations under this section, <!-- PDFPage:238 -->such station shall notify the operator, in writing, of the alleged failure and identify its reasons for believing that the cable operator is obligated to carry the signal of such station or has otherwise failed to comply with the channel positioning or repositioning or other requirements of this section. The cable operator shall, within 30 days of such written notification, respond in writing to such notification and either commence to carry the signal of such station in accordance with the terms requested or state its reasons for believing that it is not obligated to carry such signal or is in compliance with the channel positioning and repositioning and other requirements of this section. A local commercial television station that is denied carriage or channel positioning or repositioning in accordance with this section by a cable operator may obtain review of such denial by filing a complaint with the Commission. Such complaint shall allege the manner in which such cable operator has failed to meet its obligations and the basis for such allegations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Opportunity to respond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall afford such cable operator an opportunity to present data and arguments to establish that there has been no failure to meet its obligations under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedial actions; dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 120 days after the date a complaint is filed, the Commission shall determine whether the cable operator has met its obligations under this section. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has failed to meet such obligations, the Commission shall order the cable operator to reposition the complaining station or, in the case of an obligation to carry a station, to commence carriage of the station and to continue such carriage for at least 12 months. If the Commission determines that the cable operator has fully met the requirements of this section, it shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Input selector switch rules abolished</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No cable operator shall be required&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide or make available any input selector switch as defined in section 76.5(mm) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any comparable device; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide information to subscribers about input selector switches or comparable devices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, following a rulemaking proceeding, issue regulations implementing the requirements imposed by this section. Such implementing regulations shall include necessary revisions to update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sales presentations and program length commercials</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Carriage pending proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pending the outcome of the proceeding under paragraph (2), nothing in this chapter shall require a cable operator to carry on any tier, or prohibit a cable operator from carrying on any tier, the signal of any commercial television station or video programming service that is predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proceeding concerning certain stations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 270 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission, notwithstanding prior proceedings to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, shall complete a proceeding in accordance with this paragraph to determine whether broadcast television stations that are predominantly utilized for the transmission of sales presentations or program length commercials are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In conducting such proceeding, the Commission shall provide appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. The Commission shall consider the viewing of such stations, the level of competing demands for the spectrum allocated to such stations, and the role of such stations in providing competition to nonbroadcast services offering similar programming. In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall qualify such stations as local commercial television stations for purposes of subsection (a) of this section. In the event that the Commission concludes that one or more of such stations are not serving the public interest, convenience, and necessity, the Commission shall allow the licensees of such stations a reasonable period within which to provide different programming, and shall not deny such stations a renewal expectancy solely because their programming consisted predominantly of sales presentations or program length commercials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Definitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Local commercial television station</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;local commercial television station&rdquo; means any full power television broadcast station, other than a qualified noncommercial educational television station within the meaning of section 535(<em>l</em>)(1) of this title, licensed and operating on a channel regularly assigned to its community by the Commission that, with respect to a particular cable system, is within the same television market as the cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;local commercial television station&rdquo; shall not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) low power television stations, television translator stations, and passive repeaters which operate pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulations thereto;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:239 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a television broadcast station that would be considered a distant signal under section 111 of title 17, if such station does not agree to indemnify the cable operator for any increased copyright liability resulting from carriage on the cable system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a television broadcast station that does not deliver to the principal headend of a cable system either a signal level of &minus;45dBm for UHF signals or &minus;49dBm for VHF signals at the input terminals of the signal processing equipment, if such station does not agree to be responsible for the costs of delivering to the cable system a signal of good quality or a baseband video signal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Market determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For purposes of this section, a broadcasting station's market shall be determined by the Commission by regulation or order using, where available, commercial publications which delineate television markets based on viewing patterns, except that, following a written request, the Commission may, with respect to a particular television broadcast station, include additional communities within its television market or exclude communities from such station's television market to better effectuate the purposes of this section. In considering such requests, the Commission may determine that particular communities are part of more than one television market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In considering requests filed pursuant to clause (i), the Commission shall afford particular attention to the value of localism by taking into account such factors as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) whether the station, or other stations located in the same area, have been historically carried on the cable system or systems within such community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) whether the television station provides coverage or other local service to such community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) whether any other television station that is eligible to be carried by a cable system in such community in fulfillment of the requirements of this section provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) evidence of viewing patterns in cable and noncable households within the areas served by the cable system or systems in such community.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) A cable operator shall not delete from carriage the signal of a commercial television station during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Within 120 days after the date on which a request is filed under this subparagraph (or 120 days after February 8, 1996, if later), the Commission shall grant or deny the request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified low power station</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified low power station&rdquo; means any television broadcast station conforming to the rules established for Low Power Television Stations contained in part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such station meets all obligations and requirements applicable to television broadcast stations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to the broadcast of nonentertainment programming; programming and rates involving political candidates, election issues, controversial issues of public importance, editorials, and personal attacks; programming for children; and equal employment opportunity; and the Commission determines that the provision of such programming by such station would address local news and informational needs which are not being adequately served by full power television broadcast stations because of the geographic distance of such full power stations from the low power station's community of license;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such station complies with interference regulations consistent with its secondary status pursuant to part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such station is located no more than 35 miles from the cable system's headend, and delivers to the principal headend of the cable system an over-the-air signal of good quality, as determined by the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the community of license of such station and the franchise area of the cable system are both located outside of the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, ranked by population, as determined by the Office of Management and Budget on June 30, 1990, and the population of such community of license on such date did not exceed 35,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) there is no full power television broadcast station licensed to any community within the county or other political subdivision (of a State) served by the cable system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to change the secondary status of any low power station as provided in part 74 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on October 5, 1992.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Remedies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Complaint</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a qualified local noncommercial educational television station believes that a cable operator of a cable system has failed to comply with the signal carriage requirements of this section, the station may file a complaint with the Commission.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of fees per annum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any twelve-month period, the franchise fees paid by a cable operator with respect to any cable system shall not exceed 5 percent of such cable operator's gross revenues derived in such period from the operation of the cable system to provide cable services. For purposes of this section, the 12-month period shall be the 12-month period applicable under the franchise for accounting purposes. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a franchising authority and a cable operator from agreeing that franchise fees which lawfully could be collected for any such 12-month period shall be paid on a prepaid or deferred basis; except that the sum of the fees paid during the term of the franchise may not exceed the amount, including the time value of money, which would have lawfully been collected if such fees had been paid per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Itemization of subscriber bills</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cable operator may identify, consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 543 of this title, as a separate line item on each regular bill of each subscriber, each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The amount of the total bill assessed as a franchise fee and the identity of the franchising authority to which the fee is paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount of the total bill assessed to satisfy any requirements imposed on the cable operator by the franchise agreement to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The amount of any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any governmental authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Court actions; reflection of costs in rate structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any court action under subsection (c) of this section, the franchising authority shall demonstrate that the rate structure reflects all costs of the franchise fees.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:245 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Decreases passed through to subscribers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any cable operator shall pass through to subscribers the amount of any decrease in a franchise fee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Itemization of franchise fee in bill</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator may designate that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the franchise fee as a separate item on the bill.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Franchise fee&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;franchise fee&rdquo; includes any tax, fee, or assessment of any kind imposed by a franchising authority or other governmental entity on a cable operator or cable subscriber, or both, solely because of their status as such;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;franchise fee&rdquo; does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any tax, fee, or assessment of general applicability (including any such tax, fee, or assessment imposed on both utilities and cable operators or their services but not including a tax, fee, or assessment which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or cable subscribers);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any franchise in effect on October 30, 1984, payments which are required by the franchise to be made by the cable operator during the term of such franchise for, or in support of the use of, public, educational, or governmental access facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of any franchise granted after October 30, 1984, capital costs which are required by the franchise to be incurred by the cable operator for public, educational, or governmental access facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) requirements or charges incidental to the awarding or enforcing of the franchise, including payments for bonds, security funds, letters of credit, insurance, indemnification, penalties, or liquidated damages; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) any fee imposed under title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Uncompensated services; taxes, fees and other assessments; limitation on fees</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;543. Regulation of rates</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Competition preference; local and Federal regulation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No Federal agency or State may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service except to the extent provided under this section and section 532 of this title. Any franchising authority may regulate the rates for the provision of cable service, or any other communications service provided over a cable system to cable subscribers, but only to the extent provided under this section. No Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may regulate the rates for cable service of a cable system that is owned or operated by a local government or franchising authority within whose jurisdiction that cable system is located and that is the only cable system located within such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preference for competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission finds that a cable system is subject to effective competition, the rates for the provision of cable service by such system shall not be subject to regulation by the Commission or by a State or franchising authority under this section. If the Commission finds that a cable system is not subject to effective competition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for the provision of basic cable service shall be subject to regulation by a franchising authority, or by the Commission if the Commission exercises jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (6), in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rates for cable programming services shall be subject to regulation by the Commission under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualification of franchising authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A franchising authority that seeks to exercise the regulatory jurisdiction permitted under paragraph (2)(A) shall file with the Commission a written certification that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:246 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority will adopt and administer regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority has the legal authority to adopt, and the personnel to administer, such regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Approval by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification filed by a franchising authority under paragraph (3) shall be effective 30 days after the date on which it is filed unless the Commission finds, after notice to the authority and a reasonable opportunity for the authority to comment, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the franchising authority has adopted or is administering regulations with respect to the rates subject to regulation under this section that are not consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchising authority does not have the legal authority to adopt, or the personnel to administer, such regulations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) procedural laws and regulations applicable to rate regulation proceedings by such authority do not provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification, the Commission shall notify the franchising authority of any revisions or modifications necessary to obtain approval.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Revocation of jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon petition by a cable operator or other interested party, the Commission shall review the regulation of cable system rates by a franchising authority under this subsection. A copy of the petition shall be provided to the franchising authority by the person filing the petition. If the Commission finds that the franchising authority has acted inconsistently with the requirements of this subsection, the Commission shall grant appropriate relief. If the Commission, after the franchising authority has had a reasonable opportunity to comment, determines that the State and local laws and regulations are not in conformance with the regulations prescribed by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall revoke the jurisdiction of such authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exercise of jurisdiction by Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commission disapproves a franchising authority's certification under paragraph (4), or revokes such authority's jurisdiction under paragraph (5), the Commission shall exercise the franchising authority's regulatory jurisdiction under paragraph (2)(A) until the franchising authority has qualified to exercise that jurisdiction by filing a new certification that meets the requirements of paragraph (3). Such new certification shall be effective upon approval by the Commission. The Commission shall act to approve or disapprove any such new certification within 90 days after the date it is filed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Aggregation of equipment costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall allow cable operators, pursuant to any rules promulgated under subsection (b)(3) of this section, to aggregate, on a franchise, system, regional, or company level, their equipment costs into broad categories, such as converter boxes, regardless of the varying levels of functionality of the equipment within each such broad category. Such aggregation shall not be permitted with respect to equipment used by subscribers who receive only a rate regulated basic service tier.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Revision to Commission rules; forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 120 days of February 8, 1996, the Commission shall issue revisions to the appropriate rules and forms necessary to implement subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of basic service tier rate regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission obligation to subscribers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, by regulation, ensure that the rates for the basic service tier are reasonable. Such regulations shall be designed to achieve the goal of protecting subscribers of any cable system that is not subject to effective competition from rates for the basic service tier that exceed the rates that would be charged for the basic service tier if such cable system were subject to effective competition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Commission regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe, and periodically thereafter revise, regulations to carry out its obligations under paragraph (1). In prescribing such regulations, the Commission&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall seek to reduce the administrative burdens on subscribers, cable operators, franchising authorities, and the Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may adopt formulas or other mechanisms and procedures in complying with the requirements of subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall take into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the direct costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing signals carried on the basic service tier, including signals and services carried on the basic service tier pursuant to paragraph (7)(B), and changes in such costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) only such portion of the joint and common costs (if any) of obtaining, transmitting, and otherwise providing such signals as is determined, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to be reasonably and properly allocable to the basic service tier, and changes in such costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from pro<!-- PDFPage:247 -->gramming that is carried as part of the basic service tier or from other consideration obtained in connection with the basic service tier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the reasonably and properly allocable portion of any amount assessed as a franchise fee, tax, or charge of any kind imposed by any State or local authority on the transactions between cable operators and cable subscribers or any other fee, tax, or assessment of general applicability imposed by a governmental entity applied against cable operators or cable subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) any amount required, in accordance with paragraph (4), to satisfy franchise requirements to support public, educational, or governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) a reasonable profit, as defined by the Commission consistent with the Commission's obligations to subscribers under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to establish, on the basis of actual cost, the price or rate for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) installation and lease of the equipment used by subscribers to receive the basic service tier, including a converter box and a remote control unit and, if requested by the subscriber, such addressable converter box or other equipment as is required to access programming described in paragraph (8); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) installation and monthly use of connections for additional television receivers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Costs of franchise requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include standards to identify costs attributable to satisfying franchise requirements to support public, educational, and governmental channels or the use of such channels or any other services required under the franchise.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Implementation and enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection shall include additional standards, guidelines, and procedures concerning the implementation and enforcement of such regulations, which shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) procedures by which cable operators may implement and franchising authorities may enforce the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) procedures for the expeditious resolution of disputes between cable operators and franchising authorities concerning the administration of such regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) standards and procedures to prevent unreasonable charges for changes in the subscriber's selection of services or equipment subject to regulation under this section, which standards shall require that charges for changing the service tier selected shall be based on the cost of such change and shall not exceed nominal amounts when the system's configuration permits changes in service tier selection to be effected solely by coded entry on a computer terminal or by other similarly simple method; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) standards and procedures to assure that subscribers receive notice of the availability of the basic service tier required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The procedures prescribed by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (5)(A) shall require a cable operator to provide 30 days&rsquo; advance notice to a franchising authority of any increase proposed in the price to be charged for the basic service tier.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Components of basic tier subject to rate regulation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Minimum contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each cable operator of a cable system shall provide its subscribers a separately available basic service tier to which subscription is required for access to any other tier of service. Such basic service tier shall, at a minimum, consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) All signals carried in fulfillment of the requirements of sections 534 and 535 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Any public, educational, and governmental access programming required by the franchise of the cable system to be provided to subscribers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Any signal of any television broadcast station that is provided by the cable operator to any subscriber, except a signal which is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier beyond the local service area of such station.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Permitted additions to basic tier</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may add additional video programming signals or services to the basic service tier. Any such additional signals or services provided on the basic service tier shall be provided to subscribers at rates determined under the regulations prescribed by the Commission under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Buy-through of other tiers prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A cable operator may not require the subscription to any tier other than the basic service tier required by paragraph (7) as a condition of access to video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. A cable operator may not discriminate between subscribers to the basic service tier and other subscribers with regard to the rates charged for video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception; limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prohibition in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a cable system that, by reason of the lack of addressable converter boxes or other technological limitations, does not permit the operator to offer programming on a per channel or per program basis in the same manner required by subparagraph (A). This subparagraph shall not be available to any cable operator after&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:248 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the technology utilized by the cable system is modified or improved in a way that eliminates such technological limitation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 10 years after October 5, 1992, subject to subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If, in any proceeding initiated at the request of any cable operator, the Commission determines that compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (A) would require the cable operator to increase its rates, the Commission may, to the extent consistent with the public interest, grant such cable operator a waiver from such requirements for such specified period as the Commission determines reasonable and appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulation of unreasonable rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commission regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) criteria prescribed in accordance with paragraph (2) for identifying, in individual cases, rates for cable programming services that are unreasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fair and expeditious procedures for the receipt, consideration, and resolution of complaints from any franchising authority (in accordance with paragraph (3)) alleging that a rate for cable programming services charged by a cable operator violates the criteria prescribed under subparagraph (A), which procedures shall include the minimum showing that shall be required for a complaint to obtain Commission consideration and resolution of whether the rate in question is unreasonable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the procedures to be used to reduce rates for cable programming services that are determined by the Commission to be unreasonable and to refund such portion of the rates or charges that were paid by subscribers after the filing of the first complaint filed with the franchising authority under paragraph (3) and that are determined to be unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the criteria for determining in individual cases whether rates for cable programming services are unreasonable under paragraph (1)(A), the Commission shall consider, among other factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rates for similarly situated cable systems offering comparable cable programming services, taking into account similarities in facilities, regulatory and governmental costs, the number of subscribers, and other relevant factors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rates for cable systems, if any, that are subject to effective competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the history of the rates for cable programming services of the system, including the relationship of such rates to changes in general consumer prices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the rates, as a whole, for all the cable programming, cable equipment, and cable services provided by the system, other than programming provided on a per channel or per program basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) capital and operating costs of the cable system, including the quality and costs of the customer service provided by the cable system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the revenues (if any) received by a cable operator from advertising from programming that is carried as part of the service for which a rate is being established, and changes in such revenues, or from other consideration obtained in connection with the cable programming services concerned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review of rate changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall review any complaint submitted by a franchising authority after February 8, 1996, concerning an increase in rates for cable programming services and issue a final order within 90 days after it receives such a complaint, unless the parties agree to extend the period for such review. A franchising authority may not file a complaint under this paragraph unless, within 90 days after such increase becomes effective it receives subscriber complaints.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sunset of upper tier rate regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection shall not apply to cable programming services provided after March 31, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Uniform rate structure required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall have a rate structure, for the provision of cable service, that is uniform throughout the geographic area in which cable service is provided over its cable system. This subsection does not apply to (1) a cable operator with respect to the provision of cable service over its cable system in any geographic area in which the video programming services offered by the operator in that area are subject to effective competition, or (2) any video programming offered on a per channel or per program basis. Bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units shall not be subject to this subsection, except that a cable operator of a cable system that is not subject to effective competition may not charge predatory prices to a multiple dwelling unit. Upon a prima facie showing by a complainant that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the discounted price is predatory, the cable system shall have the burden of showing that its discounted price is not predatory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Discrimination; services for the hearing impaired</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting any Federal agency, State, or a franchising authority from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prohibiting discrimination among subscribers and potential subscribers to cable service, except that no Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may prohibit a cable operator from offering reasonable discounts to senior citizens or other economically disadvantaged group discounts; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requiring and regulating the installation or rental of equipment which facilitates the reception of cable service by hearing impaired individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Negative option billing prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator shall not charge a subscriber for any service or equipment that the subscriber <!-- PDFPage:249 -->has not affirmatively requested by name. For purposes of this subsection, a subscriber's failure to refuse a cable operator's proposal to provide such service or equipment shall not be deemed to be an affirmative request for such service or equipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Collection of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, by regulation, require cable operators to file with the Commission or a franchising authority, as appropriate, within one year after October 5, 1992, and annually thereafter, such financial information as may be needed for purposes of administering and enforcing this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prevention of evasions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall, by regulation, establish standards, guidelines, and procedures to prevent evasions, including evasions that result from retiering, of the requirements of this section and shall, thereafter, periodically review and revise such standards, guidelines, and procedures.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Small system burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing and prescribing regulations pursuant to this section, the Commission shall design such regulations to reduce the administrative burdens and cost of compliance for cable systems that have 1,000 or fewer subscribers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Rate regulation agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the term of an agreement made before July 1, 1990, by a franchising authority and a cable operator providing for the regulation of basic cable service rates, where there was not effective competition under Commission rules in effect on that date, nothing in this section (or the regulations thereunder) shall abridge the ability of such franchising authority to regulate rates in accordance with such an agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports on average prices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall annually publish statistical reports on the average rates for basic cable service and other cable programming, and for converter boxes, remote control units, and other equipment, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cable systems that the Commission has found are subject to effective competition under subsection (a)(2) of this section, compared with</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cable systems that the Commission has found are not subject to such effective competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;effective competition&rdquo; means that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) fewer than 30 percent of the households in the franchise area subscribe to the cable service of a cable system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the franchise area is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) served by at least two unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors each of which offers comparable video programming to at least 50 percent of the households in the franchise area; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cable service unprotected by Constitution; blockage of premium channel upon request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as prohibiting a franchising authority and a cable operator from specifying, in a franchise or renewal thereof, that certain cable services shall not be provided or shall be provided subject to conditions, if such cable services are obscene or are otherwise unprotected by the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to restrict the viewing of of of&nbsp;<sup><a href="#544_1_target" name="544_1">1</a></sup> programming which is obscene or indecent, upon <!-- PDFPage:251 -->the request of a subscriber, a cable operator shall provide (by sale or lease) a device by which the subscriber can prohibit viewing of a particular cable service during periods selected by that subscriber.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If a cable operator provides a premium channel without charge to cable subscribers who do not subscribe to such premium channel, the cable operator shall, not later than 30 days before such premium channel is provided without charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) notify all cable subscribers that the cable operator plans to provide a premium channel without charge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notify all cable subscribers when the cable operator plans to offer a premium channel without charge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) notify all cable subscribers that they have a right to request that the channel carrying the premium channel be blocked; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) block the channel carrying the premium channel upon the request of a subscriber.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purpose of this section, the term &ldquo;premium channel&rdquo; shall mean any pay service offered on a per channel or per program basis, which offers movies rated by the Motion Picture Association of America as X, NC&ndash;17, or R.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Technical standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within one year after October 5, 1992, the Commission shall prescribe regulations which establish minimum technical standards relating to cable systems&rsquo; technical operation and signal quality. The Commission shall update such standards periodically to reflect improvements in technology. No State or franchising authority may prohibit, condition, or restrict a cable system's use of any type of subscriber equipment or any transmission technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on regulatory powers of Federal agencies, States, or franchising authorities; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any Federal agency, State, or franchising authority may not impose requirements regarding the provision or content of cable services, except as expressly provided in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any rule, regulation, or order issued under any Federal law, as such rule, regulation, or order (i) was in effect on September 21, 1983, or (ii) may be amended after such date if the rule, regulation, or order as amended is not inconsistent with the express provisions of this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any rule, regulation, or order under title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Access to emergency information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any such rule, regulation, or order, each cable operator shall comply with such standards as the Commission shall prescribe to ensure that viewers of video programming on cable systems are afforded the same emergency information as is afforded by the emergency broadcasting system pursuant to Commission regulations in subpart G of part 73, title 47, Code of Federal Regulations.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;544a. Consumer electronics equipment compatibility</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) new and recent models of television receivers and video cassette recorders often contain premium features and functions that are disabled or inhibited because of cable scrambling, encoding, or encryption technologies and devices, including converter boxes and remote control devices required by cable operators to receive programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if these problems are allowed to persist, consumers will be less likely to purchase, and electronics equipment manufacturers will be less likely to develop, manufacture, or offer for sale, television receivers and video cassette recorders with new and innovative features and functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) cable operators should use technologies that will prevent signal thefts while permitting consumers to benefit from such features and functions in such receivers and recorders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) compatibility among televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems can be assured with narrow technical standards that mandate a minimum degree of common design and operation, leaving all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options for selection through open competition in the market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compatible interfaces</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report; regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 1 year after October 5, 1992, the Commission, in consultation with representatives of the cable industry and the consumer electronics industry, shall report to Congress on means of assuring compatibility between televisions and video cassette recorders and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable systems and the functions available on their televisions and video cassette recorders. Within 180 days after the date of submission of the report required by this subsection, the Commission shall issue such regulations as are necessary to assure such compatibility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scrambling and encryption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing the regulations referred to in paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether and, if so, under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict cable systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals, except that the Commission shall not limit the use of scrambling or encryption technology where the use of such technology does not interfere with the functions of subscribers&rsquo; television receivers or video cassette recorders.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rulemaking requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing the regulations required by this section, the Commission shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need to maximize open competition in the market for all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options of converter boxes and other cable converters unrelated to the descrambling or decryption of cable television signals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the costs and benefits to consumers of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators and television manufacturers in a manner that, while providing effective protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable service, will minimize interference with or nullification of the special functions of subscribers&rsquo; television receivers or video cassette recorders, including functions that permit the subscriber&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or to protect such signals against unauthorized reception.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section shall include such regulations as are necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to specify the technical requirements with which a television receiver or video cassette recorder must comply in order to be sold as &ldquo;cable compatible&rdquo; or &ldquo;cable ready&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to require cable operators offering channels whose reception requires a converter box&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may be unable to benefit from the special functions of their television receivers and video cassette recorders, including functions that permit subscribers&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent technically and economically feasible, to offer subscribers the option of having all other channels delivered directly to the subscribers&rsquo; television receivers or video cassette recorders without passing through the converter box;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:253 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote the commercial availability, from cable operators and retail vendors that are not affiliated with cable systems, of converter boxes and of remote control devices compatible with converter boxes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to ensure that any standards or regulations developed under the authority of this section to ensure compatibility between televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems do not affect features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options other than those specified in paragraph (1)(B), including telecommunications interface equipment, home automation communications, and computer network services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to require a cable operator who offers subscribers the option of renting a remote control unit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to notify subscribers that they may purchase a commercially available remote control device from any source that sells such devices rather than renting it from the cable operator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to specify the types of remote control units that are compatible with the converter box supplied by the cable operator; and</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grounds for modification by franchising authority; public proceeding; time of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the period a franchise is in effect, the cable operator may obtain from the franchising authority modifications of the requirements in such franchise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of any such requirement for facilities or equipment, including public, educational, or governmental access facilities or equipment, if the cable operator demonstrates that (i) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement, and (ii) the proposal by the cable operator for modification of such requirement is appropriate because of commercial impracticability; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any such requirement for services, if the cable operator demonstrates that the mix, quality, and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any final decision by a franchising authority under this subsection shall be made in a public proceeding. Such decision shall be made within 120 days after receipt of such request by the franchising authority, unless such 120 day period is extended by mutual agreement of the cable operator and the franchising authority.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial proceedings; grounds for modification by court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cable operator whose request for modification under subsection (a) of this section has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority may obtain modification of such franchise requirements pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for facilities or equipment, the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the terms of the modification requested are appropriate because of commercial impracticability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of any proposed modification of a requirement for services, the court shall grant such modification only if the cable operator demonstrates to the court that the mix, quality, and level of services required by the franchise at the time it was granted will be maintained after such modification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rearrangement, replacement, or removal of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable operator may, upon 30 days&rsquo; advance notice to the franchising authority, rearrange, replace, or remove a particular cable service required by the franchise if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such service is no longer available to the operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such service is available to the operator only upon the payment of a royalty required under section 801(b)(2) of title 17, which the cable operator can document&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is substantially in excess of the amount of such payment required on the date of the operator's offer to provide such service, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has not been specifically compensated for through a rate increase or other adjustment.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:254 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rearrangement of particular services from one service tier to another or other offering of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a cable operator may take such actions to rearrange a particular service from one service tier to another, or otherwise offer the service, if the rates for all of the service tiers involved in such actions are not subject to regulation under section 543 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Requirements for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A cable operator may not obtain modification under this section of any requirement for services relating to public, educational, or governmental access.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Commercially impracticable&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;commercially impracticable&rdquo; means, with respect to any requirement applicable to a cable operator, that it is commercially impracticable for the operator to comply with such requirement as a result of a change in conditions which is beyond the control of the operator and the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the requirement was based.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;546. Renewal</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement of proceedings; public notice and participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A franchising authority may, on its own initiative during the 6-month period which begins with the 36th month before the franchise expiration, commence a proceeding which affords the public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of (A) identifying the future cable-related community needs and interests, and (B) reviewing the performance of the cable operator under the franchise during the then current franchise term. If the cable operator submits, during such 6-month period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such a proceeding, the franchising authority shall commence such a proceeding not later than 6 months after the date such notice is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The cable operator may not invoke the renewal procedures set forth in subsections (b) through (g) of this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such a proceeding is requested by the cable operator by timely submission of such notice; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such a proceeding is commenced by the franchising authority on its own initiative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission of renewal proposals; contents; time</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection (a) of this section, a cable operator seeking renewal of a franchise may, on its own initiative or at the request of a franchising authority, submit a proposal for renewal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to section 544 of this title, any such proposal shall contain such material as the franchising authority may require, including proposals for an upgrade of the cable system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The franchising authority may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice of proposal; renewal; preliminary assessment of nonrenewal; administrative review; issues; notice and opportunity for hearing; transcript; written decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon submittal by a cable operator of a proposal to the franchising authority for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the franchising authority shall provide prompt public notice of such proposal and, during the 4-month period which begins on the date of the submission of the cable operator's proposal pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, renew the franchise or, issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the operator or on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding, after providing prompt public notice of such proceeding, in accordance with paragraph (2) to consider whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cable operator has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing franchise and with applicable law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the quality of the operator's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in light of community needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment as set forth in the operator's proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any proceeding under paragraph (1), the cable operator shall be afforded adequate notice and the cable operator and the franchise authority, or its designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under subsection (a) of this section), to require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the completion of a proceeding under this subsection, the franchising authority shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for renewal based upon the record of such proceeding, and transmit a copy of such decision to the cable operator. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basis for denial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with subsection (b) of this section shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) of this section, pursuant to the record of the proceeding under subsection (c) <!-- PDFPage:255 -->of this section. A franchising authority may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section or on events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section in any case in which a violation of the franchise or the events considered under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section occur after the effective date of this subchapter unless the franchising authority has provided the operator with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the franchising authority has waived its right to object, or the cable operator gives written notice of a failure or inability to cure and the franchising authority fails to object within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial review; grounds for relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any cable operator whose proposal for renewal has been denied by a final decision of a franchising authority made pursuant to this section, or has been adversely affected by a failure of the franchising authority to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section, may appeal such final decision or failure pursuant to the provisions of section 555 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any action of the franchising authority, other than harmless error, is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the event of a final decision of the franchising authority denying the renewal proposal, the operator has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the franchising authority with respect to each of the factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of subsection (c)(1) of this section on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the proceeding conducted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Finality of administrative decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any decision of a franchising authority on a proposal for renewal shall not be considered final unless all administrative review by the State has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Franchise expiration&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;franchise expiration&rdquo; means the date of the expiration of the term of the franchise, as provided under the franchise, as it was in effect on October 30, 1984.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Alternative renewal procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section, a cable operator may submit a proposal for the renewal of a franchise pursuant to this subsection at any time, and a franchising authority may, after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time (including after proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced). The provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of this section shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a proposal under this subsection. The denial of a renewal pursuant to this subsection shall not affect action on a renewal proposal that is submitted in accordance with subsections (a) through (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Effect of renewal procedures upon action to revoke franchise for cause</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) through (h) of this section, any lawful action to revoke a cable operator's franchise for cause shall not be negated by the subsequent initiation of renewal proceedings by the cable operator under this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Geographic limitations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commercial consumer availability of equipment used to access services provided by multichannel video programming distributors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, in consultation with appropriate industry standard-setting organizations, adopt regulations to assure the commercial availability, to consumers of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel video programming distributor. Such regulations shall not prohibit any multichannel video programming distributor from also offering converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, to consumers, if the system operator's charges to consumers for such devices and equipment are separately stated and not subsidized by charges for any such service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of system security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall not prescribe regulations under subsection (a) of this section which would jeopardize security of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, or impede the legal rights of a provider of such services to prevent theft of service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall waive a regulation adopted under subsection (a) of this section for a limited time upon an appropriate showing by a provider of multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, or an equipment provider, that such waiver is necessary to assist the development or introduction of a new or improved multichannel video programming or other service offered over multichannel video programming systems, technology, or products. Upon an appropriate showing, the Commission shall grant any such waiver request within 90 days of any application filed under this subsection, and such waiver shall be effective for all service providers and products in that category and for all providers of services and products.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Avoidance of redundant regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Commercial availability determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Determinations made or regulations prescribed by the Commission with respect to commercial availability to consumers of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel video programming and other services offered over multichannel video programming systems, before February 8, 1996, shall fulfill the requirements of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sunset</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations adopted under this section shall cease to apply when the Commission determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the market for the multichannel video programming distributors is fully competitive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the market for converter boxes, and interactive communications equipment, used in conjunction with that service is fully competitive; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;554. Equal employment opportunity</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Entities within scope of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply to any corporation, partnership, association, joint-stock company, or trust engaged primarily in the management or operation of any cable system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discrimination prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Equal opportunity in employment shall be afforded by each entity specified in subsection (a) of this section, and no person shall be discriminated against in employment by such entity because of race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Equal opportunity programs; establishment; maintenance; execution; terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any entity specified in subsection (a) of this section shall establish, maintain, and execute a positive continuing program of specific practices designed to ensure equal opportunity in every aspect of its employment policies and practices. Under the terms of its program, each such entity shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) define the responsibility of each level of management to ensure a positive application and vigorous enforcement of its policy of equal opportunity, and establish a procedure to review and control managerial and supervisory performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) inform its employees and recognized employee organizations of the equal employment opportunity policy and program and enlist their cooperation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) communicate its equal employment opportunity policy and program and its employment needs to sources of qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex, and solicit their recruitment assistance on a continuing basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conduct a continuing program to exclude every form of prejudice or discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, or sex, from its personnel policies and practices and working conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) conduct a continuing review of job structure and employment practices and adopt positive recruitment, training, job design, and other measures needed to ensure genuine equality of opportunity to participate fully in all its organizational units, occupations, and levels of responsibility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Revision of rules; required provisions; annual statistical report; notice and comment on amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, and after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall prescribe revisions in the rules under this section in order to implement the amendments made to this section by such Act. Such revisions shall be designed to promote equality of employment opportunities for females and minorities in each of the job categories itemized in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such rules shall specify the terms under which an entity specified in subsection (a) of this section shall, to the extent possible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) disseminate its equal opportunity program to job applicants, employees, and those with whom it regularly does business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) use minority organizations, organizations for women, media, educational institutions, and other potential sources of minority and female applicants, to supply referrals whenever jobs are available in its operation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) evaluate its employment profile and job turnover against the availability of minorities and women in its franchise area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) undertake to offer promotions of minorities and women to positions of greater responsibility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) encourage minority and female entrepreneurs to conduct business with all parts of its operation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) analyze the results of its efforts to recruit, hire, promote, and use the services of minorities and women and explain any difficulties encountered in implementing its equal employment opportunity program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Such rules also shall require an entity specified in subsection (a) of this section with more than 5 full-time employees to file with the Commission an annual statistical report identifying by race, sex, and job title the number of employees in each of the following full-time and part-time job categories:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Corporate officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) General Manager.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Chief Technician.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xi) Office and Clerical Personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xii) Skilled Craftspersons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xiii) Semiskilled Operatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xiv) Unskilled Laborers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(xv) Service Workers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The report required by subparagraph (A) shall be made on separate forms, provided by the Commission, for full-time and part-time employees. The Commission's rules shall sufficiently define the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (vi) of such subparagraph so as to ensure that only employees who are principal decisionmakers and who have supervisory authority are reported for such categories. The Commission shall adopt rules that define the job categories listed in clauses (vii) through (xv) in a manner that is consistent with the Commission policies in effect on June 1, 1990. The Commission shall prescribe the method by which entities shall be required to compute and report the number of minorities and women in the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (x) and the number of minorities and women in the job categories listed in clauses (i) through (xv) in proportion to the total number of qualified minorities and women in the relevant labor market. The report shall include information on hiring, promotion, and recruitment practices necessary for the Commission to evaluate the efforts of entities to comply with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection. The report shall be available for public inspection at the entity's central location and at every location where 5 or more full-time employees are regularly assigned <!-- PDFPage:263 -->to work. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the Commission from collecting or continuing to collect statistical or other employment information in a manner that it deems appropriate to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission may amend such rules from time to time to the extent necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Any such amendment shall be made after notice and opportunity for comment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Annual certification of compliance; periodic investigation of employment practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) On an annual basis, the Commission shall certify each entity described in subsection (a) of this section as in compliance with this section if, on the basis of information in the possession of the Commission, including the report filed pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section, such entity was in compliance, during the annual period involved, with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall, periodically but not less frequently than every five years, investigate the employment practices of each entity described in subsection (a) of this section, in the aggregate, as well as in individual job categories, and determine whether such entity is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, including whether such entity's employment practices deny or abridge women and minorities equal employment opportunities. As part of such investigation, the Commission shall review whether the entity's reports filed pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section accurately reflect employee responsibilities in the reported job classifications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Substantial failure to comply; penalties; notice to public and franchising authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Commission finds after notice and hearing that the entity involved has willfully or repeatedly without good cause failed to comply with the requirements of this section, such failure shall constitute a substantial failure to comply with this subchapter. The failure to obtain certification under subsection (e) of this section shall not itself constitute the basis for a determination of substantial failure to comply with this title. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;repeatedly&rdquo;, when used with respect to failures to comply, refers to 3 or more failures during any 7-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who is determined by the Commission, through an investigation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section or otherwise, to have failed to meet or failed to make best efforts to meet the requirements of this section, or rules under this section, shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty of $500 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute a separate offense. Any entity defined in subsection (a) of this section shall not be liable for more than 180 days of forfeitures which accrued prior to notification by the Commission of a potential violation. Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the forfeiture imposed on any person as a result of any violation that continues subsequent to such notification. In addition, any person liable for such penalty may also have any license under this chapter for cable auxiliary relay service suspended until the Commission determines that the failure involved has been corrected. Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or submits documentation which he knows to be false, pursuant to an application for certification under this section shall be in violation of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4), and the last 2 sentences of paragraph (2), of section 503(b) of this title shall apply to forfeitures under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commission shall provide for notice to the public and appropriate franchising authorities of any penalty imposed under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Discrimination complaints; investigation; enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Employees or applicants for employment who believe they have been discriminated against in violation of the requirements of this section, or rules under this section, or any other interested person, may file a complaint with the Commission. A complaint by any such person shall be in writing, and shall be signed and sworn to by that person. The regulations under subsection (d)(1) of this section shall specify a program, under authorities otherwise available to the Commission, for the investigation of complaints and violations, and for the enforcement of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;Cable operator&rdquo; defined; owners of multiple unit dwellings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;cable operator&rdquo; includes any operator of any satellite master antenna television system, including a system described in section 522(7)(A) of this title and any multichannel video programming distributor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such term does not include any operator of a system which, in the aggregate, serves fewer than 50 subscribers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which a cable operator is the owner of a multiple unit dwelling, the requirements of this section shall only apply to such cable operator with respect to its employees who are primarily engaged in cable telecommunications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Regulatory powers of States and franchising authorities; nonexclusive nature of remedies and enforcement provisions; covered franchises</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of any State or any franchising authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to establish or enforce any requirement which is consistent with the requirements of this section, including any requirement which affords equal employment opportunity protection for employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to establish or enforce any provision requiring or encouraging any cable operator to conduct business with enterprises which are owned or controlled by members of minority groups (as defined in section 309(i)(3)(C)(ii) of this title) or which have their principal operations located within the community served by the cable operator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to enforce any requirement of a franchise in effect on the effective date of this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:264 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The remedies and enforcement provisions of this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of, those available under this or any other law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this section shall apply to any cable operator, whether operating pursuant to a franchise granted before, on, or after October 30, 1984.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Small cable systems in nonurban areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c) of this section, a local exchange carrier with less than $100,000,000 in annual operating revenues (or any affiliate of such carrier owned by, operated by, controlled by, or under common control with such carrier) may purchase or otherwise acquire more than a 10 percent financial interest in, or any management interest in, or enter into a joint venture or partnership with, any cable system within the local exchange carrier's telephone service area that serves no more than 20,000 cable subscribers, if no more than 12,000 of those subscribers live within an urbanized area, as defined by the Bureau of the Census.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Open video systems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Certificates of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local exchange carrier may provide cable service to its cable service subscribers in its telephone service area through an open video system that complies with this section. To the extent permitted by such regulations as the Commission may prescribe consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, an operator of a cable system or any other person may provide video programming through an open video system that complies with this section. An operator of an open video system shall qualify for reduced regulatory burdens under subsection (c) of this section if the operator of such system certifies to the Commission that such carrier complies with the Commission's regulations under subsection (b) of this section and the Commission approves such certification. The Commission shall publish notice of the receipt of any such certification and shall act to approve or disapprove any such certification within 10 days after receipt of such certification.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:269 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Dispute resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall have the authority to resolve disputes under this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder. Any such dispute shall be resolved within 180 days after notice of such dispute is submitted to the Commission. At that time or subsequently in a separate damages proceeding, the Commission may, in the case of any violation of this section, require carriage, award damages to any person denied carriage, or any combination of such sanctions. Any aggrieved party may seek any other remedy available under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Commission actions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Regulations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall complete all actions necessary (including any reconsideration) to prescribe regulations that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as required pursuant to section 531, 534, or 535 of this title, prohibit an operator of an open video system from discriminating among video programming providers with regard to carriage on its open video system, and ensure that the rates, terms, and conditions for such carriage are just and reasonable, and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if demand exceeds the channel capacity of the open video system, prohibit an operator of an open video system and its affiliates from selecting the video programming services for carriage on more than one-third of the activated channel capacity on such system, but nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to limit the number of channels that the carrier and its affiliates may offer to provide directly to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) permit an operator of an open video system to carry on only one channel any video programming service that is offered by more than one video programming provider (including the local exchange carrier's video programming affiliate): <em>Provided</em>, That subscribers have ready and immediate access to any such video programming service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) extend to the distribution of video programming over open video systems the Commission's regulations concerning sports exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.67), network nonduplication (47 C.F.R. 76.92 et seq.), and syndicated exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.151 et seq.); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E)(i) prohibit an operator of an open video system from unreasonably discriminating in favor of the operator or its affiliates with regard to material or information (including advertising) provided by the operator to subscribers for the purposes of selecting programming on the open video system, or in the way such material or information is presented to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) require an operator of an open video system to ensure that video programming providers or copyright holders (or both) are able suitably and uniquely to identify their programming services to subscribers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if such identification is transmitted as part of the programming signal, require the carrier to transmit such identification without change or alteration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) prohibit an operator of an open video system from omitting television broadcast stations or other unaffiliated video programming services carried on such system from any navigational device, guide, or menu.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consumer access</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) and the regulations thereunder, nothing in this section prohibits a common carrier or its affiliate from negotiating mutually agreeable terms and conditions with over-the-air broadcast stations and other unaffiliated video programming providers to allow consumer access to their signals on any level or screen of any gateway, menu, or other program guide, whether provided by the carrier or its affiliate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduced regulatory burdens for open video systems</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any provision that applies to a cable operator under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sections 533 (other than subsection (a) thereof), 536, 543(f), 548, 551, and 554 of this title, shall apply,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) sections 531, 534, and 535 of this title, and section 325 of this title, shall apply in accordance with the regulations prescribed under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) sections 532 and 537 of this title, and parts III and IV of this subchapter (other than sections 543(f), 548, 551, and 554 of this title), shall not apply,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">to any operator of an open video system for which the Commission has approved a certification under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Commission action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the rulemaking proceeding to prescribe the regulations required by subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Commission shall, to the extent possible, impose obligations that are no greater or lesser than the obligations contained in the provisions described in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection. The Commission shall complete all action (including any reconsideration) to prescribe such regulations no later than 6 months after February 8, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An operator of an open video system under this part may be subject to the payment of fees on the gross revenues of the operator for the provision of cable service imposed by a local franchising authority or other governmental entity, in lieu of the franchise fees permitted under section 542 of this title. The rate at which such fees are imposed shall not exceed the rate at which franchise fees are imposed on any cable operator transmitting video programming in the franchise area, as determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission. An operator of an open video system may designate that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to <!-- PDFPage:270 -->the fee under this subparagraph as a separate item on the bill.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulatory streamlining</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the establishment and operation of an open video system, the requirements of this section shall apply in lieu of, and not in addition to, the requirements of subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment as cable operator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this chapter precludes a video programming provider making use of an open video system from being treated as an operator of a cable system for purposes of section 111 of title 17.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Telephone service area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;telephone service area&rdquo; when used in connection with a common carrier subject in whole or in part to subchapter II of this chapter means the area within which such carrier is offering telephone exchange service.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall establish such regulations as are necessary to ensure reasonable access to telephone service by persons with impaired hearing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hearing aid compatibility requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the Commission shall require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all essential telephones, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all telephones manufactured in the United States (other than for export) more than one year after August 16, 1988, or imported for use in the United States more than one year after August 16, 1988,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Costs and benefits; encouragement of use of currently available technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any rulemaking to implement the provisions of this section, the Commission shall specifically consider the costs and benefits to all telephone users, including persons with and without hearing impairments. The Commission shall ensure that regulations adopted to implement this section encourage the use of currently available technology and do not discourage or impair the development of improved technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Periodic review of regulations; retrofitting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall periodically review the regulations established pursuant to this section. Except for coin-operated telephones and telephones provided for emergency use, the Commission may not require the retrofitting of equipment to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commission inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after February 8, 1996, the Federal Communications Commission shall complete an inquiry to ascertain the level at which video programming is closed captioned. Such inquiry shall examine the extent to which existing or previously published programming is closed captioned, the size of the video programming provider or programming owner providing closed captioning, the size of the market served, the relative audience shares achieved, or any other related factors. The Commission shall submit to the Congress a report on the results of such inquiry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Accountability criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 18 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to implement this section. Such regulations shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) video programming first published or exhibited after the effective date of such regulations is fully accessible through the provision of closed captions, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) video programming providers or owners maximize the accessibility of video programming first published or exhibited prior to the effective date of such regulations through the provision of closed captions, except as provided in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deadlines for captioning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such regulations shall include an appropriate schedule of deadlines for the provision of closed captioning of video programming.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Commission may exempt by regulation programs, classes of programs, or services for which the Commission has determined that the provision of closed captioning would be economically burdensome to the provider or owner of such programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a provider of video programming or the owner of any program carried by the provider shall not be obligated to supply closed captions if such action would be inconsistent with contracts in effect on February 8, 1996, except that nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a video programming provider of its obligations to provide services required by Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a provider of video programming or program owner may petition the Commission for an exemption from the requirements of this section, and the Commission may grant such petition upon a showing that the requirements contained in this section would result in an undue burden.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Undue burden</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;undue burden&rdquo; means significant difficulty or expense. In determining whether the closed captions necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph would result in an undue economic burden, the factors to be considered include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the nature and cost of the closed captions for the programming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the impact on the operation of the provider or program owner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the financial resources of the provider or program owner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the type of operations of the provider or program owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Video descriptions inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall commence an inquiry to examine the use of video descriptions on video programming in order to ensure the accessibility of video programming to persons with visual impairments, and report to Congress on its findings. The Commission's report shall assess appropriate methods and schedules for phasing video descriptions into the marketplace, technical and quality standards for video descriptions, a definition of programming for which video descriptions would apply, and other technical and legal issues that the Commission deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Video description</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, &ldquo;video description&rdquo; means the insertion of audio narrated descriptions of a television program's key visual elements into natural pauses between the program's dialogue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Private rights of actions prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any private right of action to enforce any requirement of this section or any regulation thereunder. The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction with respect to any complaint under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to establish, in conjunction and in cooperation with other countries, as expeditiously as practicable a commercial communications satellite system, as part of an improved global communications network, which will be responsive to public needs and national objectives, which will serve the communication needs of the United States and other countries, and which will contribute to world peace and understanding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of telecommunication services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The new and expanded telecommunication services are to be made available as promptly as possible and are to be extended to provide global coverage at the earliest practicable date. In effectuating this program, care and attention will be directed toward providing such services to economically less developed countries and areas as well as those more highly developed, toward efficient and economical use of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum, and toward the reflection of the benefits of this new technology in both quality of services and charges for such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Private enterprise; access; competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to facilitate this development and to provide for the widest possible participation by private enterprise, United States participation in the global system shall be in the form of a private corporation, subject to appropriate governmental regulation. It is the intent of Congress that all authorized users shall have nondiscriminatory access to the system; that maximum competition be maintained in the provision of equipment and services utilized by the system; that the corporation created under this chapter be so organized and operated as to maintain and strengthen competition in the provision of communications services to the public; and that the activities of the corporation created under this chapter and of the persons or companies participating in the ownership of the corporation shall be consistent with the Federal antitrust laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Domestic use; additional systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is not the intent of Congress by this chapter to preclude the use of the communications satellite system for domestic communication services where consistent with the provisions of this chapter nor to preclude the creation of additional communications satellite systems, if required to meet unique governmental needs or if otherwise required in the national interest.</p>

After due notice and opportunity for comment, the Commission shall apply the same limitations, restrictions, and conditions to all entities subject to United States jurisdiction using space segment owned, leased, or operated by INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) National security, law enforcement, and public safety</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commission shall not impose any limitation, condition, or restriction under subparagraph (B) in a manner that will, or is reasonably likely to, result in limitation, denial, or revocation of authority for non-core services that are used by and required for a national security agency or law enforcement department or agency of the United States, or used by and required for, and otherwise in the public interest, any other Department or Agency of the United States to protect the health and safety of the public. Such services may be obtained by the United States directly from INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or a successor entity, or indirectly through COMSAT, or authorized carriers or distributors of the successor entity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude the Commission from acting upon applications of INTELSAT, Inmarsat, or their successor entities prior to the latest date set out in section 763(5)(A) of this title, including such actions as may be necessary for the United States to become the licensing jurisdiction for INTELSAT, but the Commission shall condition a grant of authority pursuant to this subsection upon compliance with sections 763 and 763a of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making the determination required by paragraph (1), the Commission shall use the licensing criteria in sections 763, 763a, and 763c of this title, and shall determine that competition in the telecommunications markets of the United States will be harmed unless the Commission finds that the privatization referred to in paragraph (1) is consistent with such criteria.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Clarification: competitive safeguards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making its licensing decisions under this subsection, the Commission shall consider whether users of non-core services provided by INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated entities are able to obtain non-core services from providers offering services other than through INTELSAT or Inmarsat or successor or separated entities, at competitive rates, terms, or conditions. Such consideration shall also include whether such licensing decisions would require users to replace equipment at substantial costs prior to the termination of its design life. In making its licensing decisions, the Commission shall also con<!-- PDFPage:292 -->sider whether competitive alternatives in individual markets do not exist because they have been foreclosed due to anticompetitive actions undertaken by or resulting from the INTELSAT or Inmarsat systems. Such licensing decisions shall be made in a manner which facilitates achieving the purposes and goals in this subchapter and shall be subject to notice and comment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional considerations in determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making its determinations and licensing decisions under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Commission shall construe such subsections in a manner consistent with the United States obligations and commitments for satellite services under the Fourth Protocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Independent facilities competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed as precluding COMSAT from investing in or owning satellites or other facilities independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or separated entities, or from providing services through reselling capacity over the facilities of satellite systems independent from INTELSAT and Inmarsat, and successor or separated entities. This subsection shall not be construed as restricting the types of contracts which can be executed or services which may be provided by COMSAT over the independent satellites or facilities described in this subsection.</p>

Such offering shall substantially dilute the aggregate ownership of such entities by such signatories or former signatories. In determining whether a public offering attains such substantial dilution, the Commission shall take into account the purposes and intent, privatization criteria, and other provisions of this subchapter, as well as market conditions. No intergovernmental organization, including INTELSAT or Inmarsat, shall have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an ownership interest in INTELSAT or the successor or separated entities of INTELSAT; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) more than minimal ownership interest in Inmarsat or the successor or separated entities of Inmarsat.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) privileges or immunities or other competitive advantages of the type accorded INTELSAT and Inmarsat and their signatories through the terms and operation of the INTELSAT Agreement and the associated Headquarters Agreement and the Inmarsat Convention; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) preferential access to orbital locations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Access to new, or renewal of access to, orbital locations shall be subject to the legal or regulatory processes of a national government that applies due diligence requirements intended to prevent the warehousing of orbital locations.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Identification required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, within 18 months after August 10, 1993, and within 6 months after August 5, 1997, prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a report identifying and recommending for reallocation bands of frequencies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that are allocated on a primary basis for Federal Government use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that are not required for the present or identifiable future needs of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that can feasibly be made available, as of the date of submission of the report or at any time during the next 15 years, for use under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] (other than for Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 305]);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the transfer of which (from Federal Government use) will not result in costs to the Federal Government, or losses of services or benefits to the public, that are excessive in relation to the benefits to the public that may be provided by non-Federal licensees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that are most likely to have the greatest potential for productive uses and public benefits under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] if allocated for non-Federal use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum amount of spectrum recommended</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial reallocation report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for reallocation in the initial report required by subsection (a) of this section, for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that in the aggregate span not less than 200 megahertz, that are located below 5 gigahertz, and that meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a) of this section. Such bands of frequencies shall include bands of frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that span in the aggregate not less than 100 megahertz.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mixed uses permitted to be counted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Bands of frequencies which a report of the Secretary under subsection (a) or (d)(1) of this section recommends be partially retained for use by Federal Government stations, but which are also recommended to be reallocated to be made available under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] for use by non-Federal stations, may be counted toward the minimum spectrum required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the bands of frequencies counted under this paragraph may not count toward more than one-half of the minimums required by paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a band of frequencies may not be counted under this paragraph unless the as<!-- PDFPage:308 -->signments of the band to Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305) are limited by geographic area, by time, or by other means so as to guarantee that the potential use to be made by such Federal Government stations is substantially less (as measured by geographic area, time, or otherwise) than the potential use to be made by non-Federal stations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the operational sharing permitted under this paragraph shall be subject to the interference regulations prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 305(a) of the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 305(a)] and to coordination procedures that the Commission and the Secretary shall jointly establish and implement to ensure against harmful interference.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Second reallocation report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall recommend for reallocation in the second report required by subsection (a) of this section, for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), a band or bands of frequencies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the aggregate span not less than 12 megahertz;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are located below 3 gigahertz; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) meet the criteria specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Criteria for identification</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Needs of the Federal Government</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider whether the band of frequencies is used to provide a communications service that is or could be available from a commercial provider or other vendor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) seek to promote&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the maximum practicable reliance on commercially available substitutes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sharing of frequencies (as permitted under subsection (b)(2) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the development and use of new communications technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the use of nonradiating communications systems where practicable; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) seek to avoid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) serious degradation of Federal Government services and operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) excessive costs to the Federal Government and users of Federal Government services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) excessive disruption of existing use of Federal Government frequencies by amateur radio licensees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Feasibility of use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a frequency band meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assume that the frequency will be assigned by the Commission under section 303 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 303) within 15 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assume reasonable rates of scientific progress and growth of demand for telecommunications services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) seek to include frequencies which can be used to stimulate the development of new technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consider the immediate and recurring costs to reestablish services displaced by the reallocation of spectrum.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Analysis of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether a band of frequencies meets the criteria specified in subsection (a)(5) of this section, the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the extent to which equipment is or will be available that is capable of utilizing the band;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the proximity of frequencies that are already assigned for commercial or other non-Federal use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the extent to which, in general, commercial users could share the frequency with amateur radio licensees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the activities of foreign governments in making frequencies available for experimentation or commercial assignments in order to support their domestic manufacturers of equipment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Power agency frequencies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Applicability of criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The criteria specified by subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed not to be met for any purpose under this subchapter with regard to any frequency assignment to, or any frequency assignment used by, a Federal power agency for the purpose of withdrawing that assignment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Mixed use eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The frequencies assigned to any Federal power agency may only be eligible for mixed use under subsection (b)(2) of this section in geographically separate areas, but in those cases where a frequency is to be shared by an affected Federal power agency and a non-Federal user, such use by the non-Federal user shall not cause harmful interference to the affected Federal power agency or adversely affect the reliability of its power system.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) &ldquo;Federal power agency&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As used in this paragraph, the term &ldquo;Federal power agency&rdquo; means the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Bonneville Power Administration, the Western Area Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, the Southeastern Power Administration, or the Alaska Power Administration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on reallocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">None of the frequencies recommended for reallocation in the reports required by this subsection shall have been recommended, prior to August 10, 1993, for reallocation to non-Federal use by international agreement.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:309 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure for identification of reallocable bands of frequencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Submission of preliminary identification to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after August 10, 1993, the Secretary shall prepare, make publicly available, and submit to the President, the Congress, and the Commission a report which makes a preliminary identification of reallocable bands of frequencies which meet the criteria established by this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Public comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide interested persons with the opportunity to submit, within 90 days after the date of its publication, written comment on the preliminary report required by paragraph (1). The Secretary shall immediately transmit a copy of any such comment to the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Comment and recommendations from Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commission shall, within 90 days after the conclusion of the period for comment provided pursuant to paragraph (2), submit to the Secretary the Commission's analysis of such comments and the Commission's recommendations for responses to such comments, together with such other comments and recommendations as the Commission deems appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Direct discussions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall encourage and provide opportunity for direct discussions among commercial representatives and Federal Government users of the spectrum to aid the Secretary in determining which frequencies to recommend for reallocation. The Secretary shall provide notice to the public and the Commission of any such discussions, including the name or names of any businesses or other persons represented in such discussions. A representative of the Commission (and of the Secretary at the election of the Secretary) shall be permitted to attend any such discussions. The Secretary shall provide the public and the Commission with an opportunity to comment on the results of any such discussions prior to the submission of the initial report required by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Timetable for reallocation and limitation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Timetable required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, as part of the reports required by subsections (a) and (d)(1) of this section, include a timetable that recommends effective dates by which the President shall withdraw or limit assignments of the frequencies specified in such reports.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expedited reallocation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Required reallocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall, as part of the report required by subsection (d)(1) of this section, specifically identify and recommend for immediate reallocation bands of frequencies that in the aggregate span not less than 50 megahertz, that meet the criteria described in subsection (a) of this section, and that can be made available for reallocation immediately upon issuance of the report required by subsection (d)(1) of this section. Such bands of frequencies shall include bands of frequencies, located below 3 gigahertz, that in the aggregate span not less than 25 megahertz.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Permitted reallocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, as part of such report, identify and recommend bands of frequencies for immediate reallocation for a mixed use pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, but such bands of frequencies may not count toward the minimums required by subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Delayed effective dates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In setting the recommended delayed effective dates, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider the need to reallocate bands of frequencies as early as possible, taking into account the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 925(b) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be based on the useful remaining life of equipment that has been purchased or contracted for to operate on identified frequencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consider the need to coordinate frequency use with other nations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) take into account the relationship between the costs to the Federal Government of changing to different frequencies and the benefits that may be obtained from commercial and other non-Federal uses of the reassigned frequencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional reallocation report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary receives a notice from the Commission pursuant to section 3002(c)(5) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the President, the Commission, and the Congress a report recommending for reallocation for use other than by Federal Government stations under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305), bands of frequencies that are suitable for the licensees identified in the Commission's notice. The Commission shall, not later than one year after receipt of such report, prepare, submit to the President and the Congress, and implement, a plan for the immediate allocation and assignment of such frequencies under the 1934 Act [47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.] to incumbent licensees described in the Commission's notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Relocation of Federal Government stations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible Federal entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any Federal entity that operates a Federal Government station assigned to a band of frequencies specified in paragraph (2) and that incurs relocation costs because of the reallocation of frequencies from Federal use to non-Federal use shall receive payment for such costs from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, in accordance with section 928 of this title. For purposes of this paragraph, Federal power agencies exempted under subsection (c)(4) of this section that choose to relocate from the frequencies identified for reallocation pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, are eligible to receive payment under this paragraph.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:310 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible frequencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The bands of eligible frequencies for purposes of this section are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the 216&ndash;220 megahertz band, the 1432&ndash;1435 megahertz band, the 1710&ndash;1755 megahertz band, and the 2385&ndash;2390 megahertz band of frequencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any other band of frequencies reallocated from Federal use to non-Federal use after January 1, 2003, that is assigned by competitive bidding pursuant to section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), except for bands of frequencies previously identified by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report, NTIA Special Publication 95&ndash;32 (1995).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition of relocation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;relocation costs&rdquo; means the costs incurred by a Federal entity to achieve comparable capability of systems, regardless of whether that capability is achieved by relocating to a new frequency assignment or by utilizing an alternative technology. Such costs include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the costs of any modification or replacement of equipment, software, facilities, operating manuals, training costs, or regulations that are attributable to relocation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the costs of all engineering, equipment, software, site acquisition and construction costs, as well as any legitimate and prudent transaction expense, including outside consultants, and reasonable additional costs incurred by the Federal entity that are attributable to relocation, including increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the costs of engineering studies, economic analyses, or other expenses reasonably incurred in calculating the estimated relocation costs that are provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the one-time costs of any modification of equipment reasonably necessary to accommodate commercial use of such frequencies prior to the termination of the Federal entity's primary allocation or protected status, when the eligible frequencies as defined in paragraph (2) of this subsection are made available for private sector uses by competitive bidding and a Federal entity retains primary allocation or protected status in those frequencies for a period of time after the completion of the competitive bidding process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the costs associated with the accelerated replacement of systems and equipment if such acceleration is necessary to ensure the timely relocation of systems to a new frequency assignment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice to Commission of estimated relocation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Commission shall notify the NTIA at least 18 months prior to the commencement of any auction of eligible frequencies defined in paragraph (2). At least 6 months prior to the commencement of any such auction, the NTIA, on behalf of the Federal entities and after review by the Office of Management and Budget, shall notify the Commission of estimated relocation costs and timelines for such relocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Upon timely request of a Federal entity, the NTIA shall provide such entity with information regarding an alternative frequency assignment or assignments to which their radiocommunications operations could be relocated for purposes of calculating the estimated relocation costs and timelines to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) To the extent practicable and consistent with national security considerations, the NTIA shall provide the information required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) by the geographic location of the Federal entities&rsquo; facilities or systems and the frequency bands used by such facilities or systems.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice to congressional committees and GAO</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall, at the time of providing an initial estimate of relocation costs to the Commission under paragraph (4)(A), submit to&nbsp;<sup><a href="#923_1_target" name="923_1">1</a></sup> Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives for approval, to the Committees on Appropriations and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate for approval, and to the Comptroller General a copy of such estimate and the timelines for relocation. Unless disapproved within 30 days, the estimate shall be approved. If disapproved, the NTIA may resubmit a revised initial estimate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Implementation of procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall take such actions as necessary to ensure the timely relocation of Federal entities&rsquo; spectrum-related operations from frequencies defined in paragraph (2) to frequencies or facilities of comparable capability. Upon a finding by the NTIA that a Federal entity has achieved comparable capability of systems by relocating to a new frequency assignment or by utilizing an alternative technology, the NTIA shall terminate the entity's authorization and notify the Commission that the entity's relocation has been completed. The NTIA shall also terminate such entity's authorization if the NTIA determines that the entity has unreasonably failed to comply with the timeline for relocation submitted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under section 928(d)(2)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Federal action to expedite spectrum transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal Government station which operates on electromagnetic spectrum that has been identified in any reallocation report under this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable through the use of the authority granted under subsection (g) of this section and any other applicable provision of law, take action to relocate its spectrum use to other frequencies that are reserved for Federal use or to consolidate its spectrum use with other Federal Gov<!-- PDFPage:311 -->ernment stations in a manner that maximizes the spectrum available for non-Federal use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Federal entity&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Federal entity&rdquo; means any department, agency, or other instrumentality of the Federal Government that utilizes a Government station license obtained under section 305 of the 1934 Act (47 U.S.C. 305).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the Comptroller General shall, within 30 days after receiving such plan, review such plan and submit to such committees an assessment of the explanation for the subsequent transfer or transfers.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions of contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial registry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The NTIA shall not exercise any option periods under any contract between the NTIA and the initial registry to operate and maintain the United States country code Internet domain unless the initial registry agrees, during the 90-day period beginning upon December 4, 2002, to carry out, and to operate the new domain in accordance with, the requirements under subsection (c) of this section.

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;317, &sect;2, Dec. 4, 2002, 116 Stat. 2766, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the World Wide Web presents a stimulating and entertaining opportunity for children to learn, grow, and develop educationally and intellectually;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Internet technology also makes available an extensive amount of information that is harmful to children, as studies indicate that a significant portion of all material available on the Internet is related to pornography;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) young children, when trying to use the World Wide Web for positive purposes, are often presented&mdash;either mistakenly or intentionally&mdash;with material that is inappropriate for their age, which can be extremely frustrating for children, parents, and educators;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) exposure of children to material that is inappropriate for them, including pornography, can distort the education and development of the Nation's youth and represents a serious harm to American families that can lead to a host of other problems for children, including inappropriate use of chat rooms, physical molestation, harassment, and legal and financial difficulties;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) young boys and girls, older teens, troubled youth, frequent Internet users, chat room participants, online risk takers, and those who communicate online with strangers are at greater risk for receiving unwanted sexual solicitation on the Internet;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) studies have shown that 19 percent of youth (ages 10 to 17) who used the Internet regularly were the targets of unwanted sexual solicitation, but less than 10 percent of the solicitations were reported to the police;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) children who come across illegal content should report it to the congressionally authorized CyberTipline, an online mechanism developed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, for citizens to report sexual crimes against children;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the CyberTipline has received more than 64,400 reports, including reports of child pornography, online enticement for sexual acts, child molestation (outside the family), and child prostitution;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) although the computer software and hardware industries, and other related industries, have developed innovative ways to help parents and educators restrict material that is harmful to minors through parental control protections and self-regulation, to date such efforts have not provided a national solution to the problem of minors accessing harmful material on the World Wide Web;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the creation of a &lsquo;green-light&rsquo; area within the United States country code Internet domain, that will contain only content that is appropriate for children under the age of 13, is analogous to the creation of a children's section within a library and will promote the positive experiences of children and families in the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first with the parent, the protection of the physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding them from material that is harmful to them is a compelling governmental interest.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendment note set out under section 901 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to facilitate the creation of a second-level domain within the United States country code Internet domain for the location of material that is suitable for minors and not harmful to minors; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to ensure that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration oversees the creation of such a second-level domain and ensures the effective and efficient establishment and operation of the new domain.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 1 year after October 25, 1994, after consulting with State and local law enforcement agencies, telecommunications carriers, providers of telecommunications support services, and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, and after notice and comment, the Attorney General shall publish in the Federal Register and provide to appropriate telecommunications industry associations and standard-setting organizations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notice of the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices, representing a portion of the maximum capacity set forth under subparagraph (B), that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously by the date that is 4 years after October 25, 1994; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notice of the maximum capacity required to accommodate all of the communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that the Attorney General estimates that government agencies authorized to conduct electronic surveillance may conduct and use simultaneously after the date that is 4 years after October 25, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Basis of notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The notices issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may be based upon the type of equipment, type of service, number of subscribers, type or size or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1003_1_target" name="1003_1">1</a></sup> carrier, nature of service area, or any other measure; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with capacity notices</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements or within 4 years after October 25, 1994, whichever is longer, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that its systems are capable of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) accommodating simultaneously the number of interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) expanding to the maximum capacity set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expansion to maximum capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the date described in paragraph (1), a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that it can accommodate expeditiously any increase in the actual number of communication interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices that authorized agencies may seek to conduct and use, up to the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notices of increased maximum capacity requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall periodically publish in the Federal Register, after notice and comment, notice of any necessary increases in the maximum capacity requirement set forth in the notice under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 3 years after notice of increased maximum capacity requirements is published under paragraph (1), or within such longer time period as the Attorney General may specify, a telecommunications carrier shall, subject to subsection (e) of this section, ensure that its systems are capable of expanding to the increased maximum capacity set forth in the notice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Carrier statement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after the publication by the Attorney General of a notice of capacity requirements pursuant to subsection (a) or (c) of this section, a telecommunications carrier shall submit to the Attorney General a statement identifying any of its systems or services that do not have the capacity to accommodate simultaneously the number of interceptions, pen registers, and trap and trace devices set forth in the notice under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement required for compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall review the statements submitted under subsection (d) of this section and may, subject to the availability of appropriations, agree to reimburse a telecommunications carrier for costs directly associated with modifications to attain such capacity requirement that are determined to be reasonable in accordance with section 1008(e) of this title. Until the Attorney General agrees to reimburse such carrier for such modification, such carrier shall be considered to be in compliance with the capacity notices under subsection (a) or (c) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to approve loan guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of this section and consistent with the purpose of this chapter, the Board may approve loan guarantees under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator (as defined in section 1104 of this title), under the direction of and for approval by the Board, shall prescribe regulations to implement the provisions of this chapter and shall do so not later than 120 days after funds authorized to be appropriated under section 1109 of this title have been appropriated in a bill signed into law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Elements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations prescribed under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) set forth the form of any application to be submitted to the Board under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) set forth time periods for the review and consideration by the Board of applications to be submitted to the Board under this chapter, and for any other action to be taken by the Board with respect to such applications;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide appropriate safeguards against the evasion of the provisions of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) set forth the circumstances in which an applicant, together with any affiliate of an applicant, shall be treated as an applicant for a loan guarantee under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) include requirements that appropriate parties submit to the Board any documents and assurances that are required for the administration of the provisions of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) include such other provisions consistent with the purpose of this chapter as the Board considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the Board from requiring, to the extent and under circumstances considered appropriate by the Board, that affiliates of an applicant be subject to certain obligations of the applicant as a condition to the approval or maintenance of a loan guarantee under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If any provision of this chapter or the application of such provision to any person or entity or circumstance is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter, or the application of such provision to such person or entity or circumstance other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority limited by appropriations acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board may approve loan guarantees under this chapter only to the extent provided for in advance in appropriations Acts, and the Board may accept credit risk premiums from a non-Federal source in order to cover the cost of a loan guarantee under this chapter, to the extent that appropriations of budget authority are insufficient to cover such costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirements and criteria applicable to approval</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall utilize the underwriting criteria developed under subsection (g) of this <!-- PDFPage:329 -->section, and any relevant information provided by the departments and agencies with which the Board consults under section 1102 of this title, to determine which loans may be eligible for a loan guarantee under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prerequisites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to meeting the underwriting criteria under paragraph (1), a loan may not be guaranteed under this chapter unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the loan is made to finance the acquisition, improvement, enhancement, construction, deployment, launch, or rehabilitation of the means by which local television broadcast signals will be delivered to a nonserved area or underserved area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the proceeds of the loan will not be used for operating, advertising, or promotion expenses, or for the acquisition of licenses for the use of spectrum in any competitive bidding under section 309(j) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the proposed project, as determined by the Board in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, is not likely to have a substantial adverse impact on competition that outweighs the benefits of improving access to the signals of a local television station in a nonserved area or underserved area and is commercially viable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D)(i) the loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is provided by any entity engaged in the business of commercial lending&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) if the loan is made in accordance with loan-to-one-borrower and affiliate transaction restrictions to which the entity is subject under applicable law; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) if item (aa) does not apply, the loan is made only to a borrower that is not an affiliate of the entity and only if the amount of the loan and all outstanding loans by that entity to that borrower and any of its affiliates does not exceed 10 percent of the net equity of the entity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is provided by a nonprofit corporation, including the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, engaged primarily in commercial lending, if the Board determines that such nonprofit corporation has one or more issues of outstanding long-term debt that is rated within the highest 3 rating categories of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the loan is provided by a lender described in clause (i)(II) and the Board determines that the making of the loan by such lender will cause a decline in such lender's debt rating as described in that clause, the Board at its discretion may disapprove the loan guarantee on this basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) no loan may be made for purposes of this chapter by a governmental entity or affiliate thereof, or by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or any institution supervised by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the Federal Housing Finance Board, or any affiliate of such entities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) any loan must have terms, in the judgment of the Board, that are consistent in material respects with the terms of similar obligations in the private capital market;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) for purposes of clause (i)(I)(bb), the term &ldquo;net equity&rdquo; means the value of the total assets of the entity, less the total liabilities of the entity, as recorded under generally accepted accounting principles for the fiscal quarter ended immediately prior to the date on which the subject loan is approved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) repayment of the loan is required to be made within a term of the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 25 years from the date of the execution of the loan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the economically useful life, as determined by the Board or in consultation with persons or entities deemed appropriate by the Board, of the primary assets to be used in the delivery of the signals concerned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the loan meets any additional criteria developed under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Protection of United States financial interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may not approve the guarantee of a loan under this chapter unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Board has been given documentation, assurances, and access to information, persons, and entities necessary, as determined by the Board, to address issues relevant to the review of the loan by the Board for purposes of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Board makes a determination in writing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to the best of its knowledge upon due inquiry, the assets, facilities, or equipment covered by the loan will be utilized economically and efficiently;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the terms, conditions, security, and schedule and amount of repayments of principal and the payment of interest with respect to the loan protect the financial interests of the United States and are reasonable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the value of collateral provided by an applicant is at least equal to the unpaid balance of the loan amount covered by the loan guarantee (the &ldquo;Amount&rdquo; for purposes of this clause); and if the value of collateral provided by an applicant is less than the Amount, the additional required collateral is provided by any affiliate of the applicant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) all necessary and required regulatory and other approvals, spectrum licenses, and delivery permissions have been received for the loan and the project under the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and conditions without a loan guarantee under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) repayment of the loan can reasonably be expected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Considerations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Type of market</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Priority considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent practicable, the Board shall give priority in the approval of <!-- PDFPage:330 -->loan guarantees under this chapter in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) First, to projects that will serve households in nonserved areas. In considering such projects, the Board shall balance projects that will serve the largest number of households with projects that will serve remote, isolated communities (including noncontiguous States) in areas that are unlikely to be served through market mechanisms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Second, to projects that will serve households in underserved areas. In considering such projects, the Board shall balance projects that will serve the largest number of households with projects that will serve remote, isolated communities (including noncontiguous States) in areas that are unlikely to be served through market mechanisms.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Within each category, the Board shall consider the project's estimated cost per household and shall give priority to those projects that provide the highest quality service at the lowest cost per household.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board should give additional consideration to projects that also provide high-speed Internet service.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may not approve a loan guarantee under this chapter for a project that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is designed primarily to serve 1 or more of the top 40 designated market areas (as that term is defined in section 122(j) of title 17); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) would alter or remove National Weather Service warnings from local broadcast signals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board shall consider other factors, which shall include projects that would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) offer a separate tier of local broadcast signals, but for applicable Federal, State, or local laws or regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide lower projected costs to consumers of such separate tier; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) enable the delivery of local broadcast signals consistent with the purpose of this chapter by a means reasonably compatible with existing systems or devices predominantly in use.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Further consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In implementing this chapter, the Board shall support the use of loan guarantees for projects that would serve households not likely to be served in the absence of loan guarantees under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Guarantee limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation on aggregate value of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The aggregate value of all loans for which loan guarantees are issued under this chapter (including the unguaranteed portion of such loans) may not exceed $1,250,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Guarantee level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A loan guarantee issued under this chapter may not exceed an amount equal to 80 percent of a loan meeting in its entirety the requirements of subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section. If only a portion of a loan meets the requirements of that subsection, the Board shall determine that percentage of the loan meeting such requirements (the &ldquo;applicable portion&rdquo;) and may issue a loan guarantee in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the applicable portion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Underwriting criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within the period provided for under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Board shall, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and an independent public accounting firm, develop underwriting criteria relating to the guarantee of loans that are consistent with the purpose of this chapter, including appropriate collateral and cash flow levels for loans guaranteed under this chapter, and such other matters as the Board considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Credit risk premiums</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment and acceptance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board may establish and approve the acceptance of credit risk premiums with respect to a loan guarantee under this chapter in order to cover the cost, as defined in section 661a(5) of title 2, of the loan guarantee. To the extent that appropriations of budget authority are insufficient to cover the cost, as so determined, of a loan guarantee under this chapter, credit risk premiums shall be accepted from a non-Federal source under this subsection on behalf of the applicant for the loan guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Authority limited by appropriations Acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be imposed only to the extent provided for in advance in appropriations Acts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit risk premium amount</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall determine the amount of any credit risk premium to be accepted with respect to a loan guarantee under this chapter on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the financial and economic circumstances of the applicant for the loan guarantee, including the amount of collateral offered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the proposed schedule of loan disbursements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the business plans of the applicant for providing service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) any financial commitment from a broadcast signal provider; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as to the amount of the credit risk premium.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Proportionality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that appropriations of budget authority are sufficient to cover the cost, as determined under section 661a(5) of title 2, of loan guarantees under this chapter, the credit risk premium with respect to each loan guarantee shall be reduced proportionately.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:331 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Payment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be paid to an account (the &ldquo;Escrow Account&rdquo;) established in the Treasury which shall accrue interest and such interest shall be retained by the account, subject to subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Deductions from Escrow Account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a default occurs with respect to any loan guaranteed under this chapter and the default is not cured in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan or loan guarantee agreement, the Administrator, in accordance with subsections (i) and (j) of section 1104 of this title, shall liquidate, or shall cause to be liquidated, all assets collateralizing such loan as to which it has a lien or security interest. Any shortfall between the proceeds of the liquidation net of costs and expenses relating to the liquidation, and the guarantee amount paid pursuant to this chapter shall be deducted from funds in the Escrow Account and credited to the Administrator for payment of such shortfall. At such time as determined under subsection (d)(2)(E) of this section when all loans guaranteed under this chapter have been repaid or otherwise satisfied in accordance with this chapter and the regulations promulgated hereunder, remaining funds in the Escrow Account, if any, shall be refunded, on a pro rata basis, to applicants whose loans guaranteed under this chapter were not in default, or where any default was cured in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan or loan guarantee agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Limitations on guarantees for certain cable operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no loan guarantee under this chapter may be granted or used to provide funds for a project that extends, upgrades, or enhances the services provided over any cable system to an area that, as of December 21, 2000, is covered by a cable franchise agreement that expressly obligates a cable system operator to serve such area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The decision of the Board to approve or disapprove the making of a loan guarantee under this chapter shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Applicability of APA</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j) of this section, the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of title 5 (commonly referred to as the Administrative Procedure Act), shall apply to actions taken under this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service (in this chapter referred to as the &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;) shall issue and otherwise administer loan guarantees that have been approved by the Board in accordance with sections 1102 and 1103 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Security for protection of United States financial interests</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An applicant shall agree to such terms and conditions as are satisfactory, in the judgment of the Board, to ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and payable on a loan guaranteed under this chapter, the applicant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall maintain assets, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall not make any discretionary dividend payments that impair its ability to repay obligations guaranteed under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall remain sufficiently capitalized; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) shall submit to, and cooperate fully with, any audit of the applicant under section 1105(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Collateral</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Existence of adequate collateral</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An applicant shall provide the Board such documentation as is necessary, in the judgment of the Board, to provide satisfactory evidence that appropriate and adequate collateral secures a loan guaranteed under this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Collateral required by subparagraph (A) shall consist solely of assets of the applicant, any affiliate of the applicant, or both (whichever the Board considers appropriate), including primary assets to be used in the delivery of signals for which the loan is guaranteed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review of valuation</h4>
