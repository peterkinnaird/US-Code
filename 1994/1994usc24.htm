<h3 class="section-head">&sect;225. Findings and purposes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Governmentally administered mental health services in the District of Columbia are currently provided through two separate public entities, the federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital and the Mental Health Services Administration of the District of Columbia Department of Human Resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The District of Columbia has a continuing responsibility to provide mental health services to its residents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government, through its operation of a national mental health program at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, has for over 100 years assisted the District of Columbia in carrying out that responsibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Since its establishment by Congress in 1855, Saint Elizabeths Hospital has developed into a respected national mental health hospital and study, training, and treatment center, providing a range of quality mental health and related services, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) acute and chronic inpatient psychiatric care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) outpatient psychiatric and substance abuse clinical and related services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Federal court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient treatment services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or post-sentence psychiatric evaluation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) patient care and related services for designated classes of individuals entitled to mental health benefits under Federal law, such as certain members and employees of the United States Armed Forces and the Foreign Service, and residents of American overseas dependencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) District of Columbia court system forensic psychiatry referral, evaluation, and patient treatment services for prisoners, and for individuals awaiting trial or requiring post-trial or postsentence psychiatric evaluation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) programs for special populations such as the mentally ill deaf;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) support for basic and applied clinical psychiatric research and related patient services conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and other institutions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(viii) professional and paraprofessional training in the major mental health disciplines.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The continuation of the range of services currently provided by federally administered Saint Elizabeths Hospital must be assured, as these services are integrally related to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the availability of adequate mental health services to District of Columbia residents, nonresidents who require mental health services while in the District of Columbia, individuals entitled to mental health services under Federal law, and individuals referred by both Federal and local court systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Nation's capacity to increase our knowledge and understanding about mental illness and to facilitate and continue the development and broad availability of sound and modern methods and approaches for the treatment of mental illness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital from the Federal Government by the District of Columbia, and the integration of those functions, resources, and programs into a comprehensive mental health care system administered solely by the District of Columbia, will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the services currently provided through those two separate entities by shifting the primary focus of care to an integrated community-based system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Such assumption of all or selected functions, programs, and resources of Saint Elizabeths Hospital by the District of Columbia would further the principle of home rule for the District of Columbia.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the intent of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the District of Columbia have in operation no later than October 1, 1993, an integrated coordinated mental health system in the District which provides&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) high quality, cost-effective, and community-based programs and facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a continuum of inpatient and outpatient mental health care, residential treatment, and support services through an appropriate balance of public and private resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) assurances that patient rights and medical needs are protected;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the comprehensive District mental health care system be in full compliance with the Federal court consent decree in Dixon v. Heckler;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the District and Federal Governments bear equitable shares of the costs of a transition from the present system to a comprehensive District mental health system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the transition to a comprehensive District mental health system provided for by this subchapter be carried out with maximum consideration for the interests of employees of the Hospital and provide a right-of-first-re<!-- PDFPage:17 -->fusal to such employees for employment at comparable levels in positions created under the system implementation plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Federal Government have the responsibility for the retraining of Hospital employees to prepare such employees for the requirements of employment in a comprehensive District mental health system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Federal Government continue high quality mental health research, training, and demonstration programs at Saint Elizabeths Hospital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the District government establish and maintain accreditation and licensing standards for all services provided in District mental health facilities which assure quality care consistent with appropriate Federal regulations and comparable with standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the comprehensive mental health system plan include a component for direct services for the homeless mentally ill.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Director of each facility that is maintained as a separate establishment of the Retirement Home shall safeguard and dispose of the estate and personal effects of deceased residents, including effects delivered to such facility under sections 4712(f) and 9712(f) of title 10, and shall ensure the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A will or other instrument of a testamentary nature involving property rights executed by a resident shall be promptly delivered, upon the death of the resident, to the proper court of record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If a resident dies intestate and the heirs or legal representative of the deceased cannot be immediately ascertained, the Director shall <!-- PDFPage:38 -->retain all property left by the decedent for a three-year period beginning on the date of the death. If entitlement to such property is established to the satisfaction of the Director at any time during the three-year period, the Director shall distribute the decedent's property, in equal pro-rata shares when multiple beneficiaries have been identified, to the highest following categories of identified survivors (listed in the order of precedence indicated):</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) If the disposition of the estate of a resident of the Retirement Home cannot be accomplished under subsection (a)(2) of this section or if a resident dies testate and the nominated fiduciary, legatees, or heirs of the resident cannot be immediately ascertained, the entirety of the deceased resident's domiciliary estate and the entirety of any ancillary estate that is unclaimed at the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the death of the resident shall escheat to the Retirement Home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Upon the sale of any such unclaimed estate property, the proceeds of the sale shall be deposited in the Retirement Home Trust Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a personal representative or other fiduciary is appointed to administer a deceased resident's estate and the administration is completed before the end of such three-year period, the balance of the entire net proceeds of the estate, less expenses, shall be deposited directly in the Retirement Home Trust Fund. The heirs or legatees of the deceased resident may file a claim made with the Comptroller General of the United States to reclaim such proceeds. A determination of the claim by the Comptroller General shall be subject to judicial review exclusively by the United States Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Director of a facility maintained as a separate establishment of the Retirement Home may designate an attorney to serve as attorney or agent for the facility in any probate proceeding in which the Retirement Home may have a legal interest as nominated fiduciary, testamentary legatee, escheat legatee, or in any other capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An attorney designated under this paragraph may, in the domiciliary jurisdiction of the deceased resident and in any ancillary jurisdiction, petition for appointment as fiduciary.

In a probate proceeding in which the heirs of an intestate deceased resident cannot be located and in a probate proceeding in which the nominated fiduciary, legatees, or heirs of a testate deceased resident cannot be located, the attorney shall be appointed as the fiduciary of the deceased resident's estate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The designation of an employee or representative of a facility of the Retirement Home as personal representative of the estate of a resident of the Retirement Home or as a legatee under the will or codicil of the resident shall not disqualify an employee or staff member of that facility from serving as a competent witness to a will or codicil of the resident.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) After the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the death of a resident of a facility, the Director of the facility shall dispose of all property of the deceased resident that is not otherwise disposed of under this subsection, including personal effects such as decorations, medals, and citations to which a right has not been established under subsection (a) of this section. Disposal may be made within the discretion of the Director by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) retaining such property or effects for the facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) offering such items to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a State, another military home, a museum, or any other institution having an interest in such items; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) destroying any items determined by the Director to be valueless.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transfer of proceeds to Fund</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A claim referred to in paragraph (1) may not be considered by a court or the Comptroller General unless the claim is filed within the time period prescribed in such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A claim allowed by the Comptroller General under paragraph (1) shall be certified to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment from the Fund in the amount found due, including any interest relating to the amount. No claim may be allowed or paid in excess of the net proceeds of the estate deposited in the Fund under subsection (c) of this section plus interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Unclaimed property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of property delivered to the Retirement Home under section 2575 of title 10, the Directors shall deliver the property to the owner, the heirs or next of kin of the owner, or the legal representative of the owner, if a right to the property is established to the satisfaction of the Directors within two years after the delivery.</p>
