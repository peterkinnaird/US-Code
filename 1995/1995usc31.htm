<!-- field-end:effectivedate-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">We in government often are quick to call for reform in other institutions, but slow to reform ourselves. Yet nowhere today is modern management more needed than in government itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed and the Congress accepted a reorganization plan that laid the groundwork for providing managerial assistance for a modern Presidency.</p>
<p class="note-body">The plan placed the Bureau of the Budget within the Executive Office of the President. It made available to the President direct access to important new management instruments. The purpose of the plan was to improve the administration of the Government&mdash;to ensure that the Government could perform &ldquo;promptly, effectively, without waste or lost motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Fulfilling that purpose today is far more difficult&mdash;and more important&mdash;than it was 30 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body">Last April, I created a President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization and named to it a distinguished group of outstanding experts headed by Roy L. Ash. I gave the Council a broad charter to examine ways in which the Executive Branch could be better organized. I asked it to recommend specific organizational changes that would make the Executive Branch a more vigorous and more effective instrument for creating and carrying out the programs that are needed today. The Council quickly concluded that the place to begin was in the Executive Office of the President itself. I agree.</p>
<p class="note-body">The past 30 years have seen enormous changes in the size, structure and functions of the Federal Government. The budget has grown from less than $10 billion to $200 billion. The number of civilian employees has risen from one million to more than two and a half million. Four new Cabinet departments have been created, along with more than a score of independent agencies. Domestic policy issues have become increasingly complex. The interrelationships among Government programs have become more intricate. Yet the organization of the President's policy and management arms has not kept pace.</p>
<p class="note-body">Over three decades, the Executive Office of the President has mushroomed but not by conscious design. In many areas it does not provide the kind of staff assistance and support the President needs in order to deal with the problems of government in the 1970s. We confront the 1970s with a staff organization geared in large measure to the tasks of the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p class="note-body">One result, over the years, has been a tendency to enlarge the immediate White House staff&mdash;that is, the President's personal staff, as distinct from the institutional structure&mdash;to assist with management functions for which the President is responsible. This has blurred the distinction between personal staff and management institutions; it has left key management functions to be performed only intermittently and some not at all. It has perpetuated outdated structures.</p>
<p class="note-body">Another result has been, paradoxically, to inhibit the delegation of authority to Departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">A President whose programs are carefully coordinated, whose information system keeps him adequately informed, and whose organizational assignments are plainly set out, can delegate authority with security and confidence. A President whose office is deficient in these respects will be inclined, instead, to retain close control of operating responsibilities which he cannot and should not handle.</p>
<p class="note-body">Improving the management processes of the President's own office, therefore, is a key element in improving the management of the entire Executive Branch, and in strengthening the authority of its Departments and agencies. By providing the tools that are needed to reduce duplication, to monitor performance and to promote greater efficiency throughout the Executive Branch, this also will enable us to give the country not only more effective but also more economical government&mdash;which it deserves.</p>
<p class="note-body">To provide the management tools and policy mechanisms needed for the 1970s, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, prepared in accordance with Chapter 9 of Title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan draws not only on the work of the Ash Council itself, but also on the work of others that preceded&mdash;including the pioneering Brownlow Committee of 1936, the two Hoover Commissions, the Rockefeller Committee, and other Presidential task forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">Essentially, the plan recognizes that two closely connected but basically separate functions both center in the President's office: policy determination and executive management. This involves (1) what government should do, and (2) how it goes about doing it.</p>
<p class="note-body">My proposed reorganization creates a new entity to deal with each of these functions:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;It establishes a Domestic Council, to coordinate policy formulation in the domestic area. This Cabinet group would be provided with an institutional staff, and to a considerable degree would be a domestic counterpart to the National Security Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;It establishes an Office of Management and Budget, which would be the President's principal arm for the exercise of his managerial functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Domestic Council will be primarily concerned with what we do; the Office of Management and Budget will be primarily concerned with <em>how</em> we do it, and <em>how well</em> we do it.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-end:notes -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">DOMESTIC COUNCIL</h4>
<p class="note-body">The past year's experience with the Council for Urban Affairs has shown how immensely valuable a Cabinet-level council can be as a forum for both discussion and action on policy matters that cut across departmental jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Domestic Council will be chaired by the President. Under the plan, its membership will include the Vice President, and the Secretaries of the Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health, Education and Welfare, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation, and the Attorney General. I also intend to designate as members the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and, while he remains a member of the Cabinet, the Postmaster General. (Although I continue to hope that the Congress will adopt my proposal to create, in place of the Post Office Department, a self-sufficient postal authority.) The President could add other Executive Branch officials at his discretion.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Council will be supported by a staff under an Executive Director who will also be one of the President's assistants. Like the National Security Council staff, this staff will work in close coordination with the President's personal staff but will have its own institutional identity. By being established on a permanent, institutional basis, it will be designed to develop and employ the &ldquo;institutional memory&rdquo; so essential if continuity is to be maintained, and if experience is to play its proper role in the policy-making process.</p>
<p class="note-body">There does not now exist an organized, institutionally-staffed group charged with advising the President on the total range of domestic policy. The Domestic Council will fill that need. Under the President's direction, it will also be charged with integrating the various aspects of domestic policy into a consistent whole.</p>
<p class="note-body">Among the specific policy functions in which I intend the Domestic Council to take the lead are these:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Assessing national needs, collecting information and developing forecasts, for the purpose of defining national goals and objectives.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:25 --><p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Identifying alternative ways of achieving these objectives, and recommending consistent, integrated sets of policy choices.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Providing rapid response to Presidential needs for policy advice on pressing domestic issues.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Coordinating the establishment of national priorities for the allocation of available resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Maintaining a continuous review of the conduct of ongoing programs from a policy standpoint, and proposing reforms as needed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Much of the Council's work will be accomplished by temporary, ad hoc project committees. These might take a variety of forms, such as task forces, planning groups or advisory bodies. They can be established with varying degrees of formality, and can be set up to deal either with broad program areas or with specific problems. The committees will draw for staff support on Department and agency experts, supplemented by the Council's own staff and that of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body">Establishment of the Domestic Council draws on the experience gained during the past year with the Council for Urban Affairs, the Cabinet Committee on the Environment and the Council for Rural Affairs. The principal key to the operation of these Councils has been the effective functioning of their various subcommittees. The Councils themselves will be consolidated into the Domestic Council; Urban, Rural and Environment subcommittees of the Domestic Council will be strengthened, using access to the Domestic Council staff.</p>
<p class="note-body">Overall, the Domestic Council will provide the President with a streamlined, consolidated domestic policy arm, adequately staffed, and highly flexible in its operation. It also will provide a structure through which departmental initiatives can be more fully considered, and expert advice from the Departments and agencies more fully utilized.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the reorganization plan, the technical and formal means by which the Office of Management and Budget is created is by re-designating the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget. The functions currently vested by law in the Bureau, or in its director, are transferred to the President, with the provision that he can then re-delegate them.</p>
<p class="note-body">As soon as the reorganization plan takes effect, I intend to delegate those statutory functions to the Director of the new Office of Management and Budget, including those under section 212 of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 [31 U.S.C. 1113].</p>
<p class="note-body">However, creation of the Office of Management and Budget represents far more than a mere change of name for the Bureau of the Budget. It represents a basic change in concept and emphasis, reflecting the broader management needs of the Office of the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office will still perform the key function of assisting the President in the preparation of the annual Federal budget and overseeing its execution. It will draw upon the skills and experience of the extraordinarily able and dedicated career staff developed by the Bureau of the Budget. But preparation of the budget as such will no longer be its dominant, overriding concern.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the budget function remains a vital tool of management, it will be strengthened by the greater emphasis the new office will place on fiscal analysis. The budget function is only one of several important management tools that the President must now have. He must also have a substantially enhanced institutional staff capability in other areas of executive management&mdash;particularly in program evaluation and coordination, improvement of Executive Branch organization, information and management systems, and development of executive talent. Under this plan, strengthened capability in these areas will be provided partly through internal reorganization, and it will also require additional staff resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office of Management and Budget will place much greater emphasis on the evaluation of program performance: on assessing the extent to which programs are actually achieving their intended results, and delivering the intended services to the intended recipients. This is needed on a continuing basis, not as a one-time effort. Program evaluation will remain a function of the individual agencies as it is today. However, a single agency cannot fairly be expected to judge overall effectiveness in programs that cross agency lines&mdash;and the difference between agency and Presidential perspectives requires a capacity in the Executive Office to evaluate program performance whenever appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office will expand efforts to improve interagency cooperation in the field. Washington-based coordinators will help work out interagency problems at the operating level, and assist in developing efficient coordinating mechanisms throughout the country. The success of these efforts depends on the experience, persuasion, and understanding of an Office which will be an expediter and catalyst. The Office will also respond to requests from State and local governments for assistance on intergovernmental programs. It will work closely with the Vice President and the Office of Intergovernmental Relations.</p>
<p class="note-body">Improvement of Government organization, information and management systems will be a major function of the Office of Management and Budget. It will maintain a continuous review of the organizational structures and management processes of the Executive Branch, and recommend needed changes. It will take the lead in developing new information systems to provide the President with the performance and other data that he needs but does not now get. When new programs are launched, it will seek to ensure that they are not simply forced into or grafted onto existing organizational structures that may not be appropriate. Resistance to organizational change is one of the chief obstacles to effective government; the new Office will seek to ensure that organization keeps abreast of program needs.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new Office will also take the lead in devising programs for the development of career executive talent throughout the Government. Not the least of the President's needs as Chief Executive is direct capability in the Executive Office for insuring that talented executives are used to the full extent of their abilities. Effective, coordinated efforts for executive manpower development have been hampered by the lack of a system for forecasting the needs for executive talent and appraising leadership potential. Both are crucial to the success of an enterprise&mdash;whether private or public.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Office of Management and Budget will be charged with advising the President on the development of new programs to recruit, train, motivate, deploy, and evaluate the men and women who make up the top ranks of the civil service, in the broadest sense of that term. It will not deal with individuals, but will rely on the talented professionals of the Civil Service Commission and the Departments and agencies themselves to administer these programs. Under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget there will be joint efforts to see to it that all executive talent is well utilized wherever it may be needed throughout the Executive Branch, and to assure that executive training and motivation meet not only today's needs but those of the years ahead.</p>
<p class="note-body">Finally, the new Office will continue the Legislative Reference functions now performed by the Bureau of the Budget, drawing together agency reactions on all proposed legislation, and helping develop legislation to carry out the President's program. It also will continue the Bureau's work of improving and coordinating Federal statistical services.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGES</h4>
<p class="note-body">The people deserve a more responsive and more effective Government. The times require it. These changes will help provide it.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:26 --><p class="note-body">Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to Section 901(a)(1), &ldquo;to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the Executive Branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;&rdquo; and Section 901(a)(3), &ldquo;to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganizations provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in Section 102(c) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the Executive Branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">While this plan will result in a modest increase in direct expenditures, its strengthening of the Executive Office of the President will bring significant indirect savings, and at the same time will help ensure that people actually receive the return they deserve for every dollar the Government spends. The savings will result from the improved efficiency these changes will provide throughout the Executive Branch&mdash;and also from curtailing the waste that results when programs simply fail to achieve their objectives. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate these indirect expenditure reductions which will result from the reorganization.</p>
<p class="note-body">I expect to follow with other reorganization plans, quite possibly including ones that will affect other activities of the Executive Office of the President. Our studies are continuing. But this by itself is a reorganization of major significance, and a key to the more effective functioning of the entire Executive Branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">These changes would provide an improved system of policy making and coordination, a strengthened capacity to perform those functions that are now the central concerns of the Bureau of the Budget, and a more effective set of management tools for the performance of other functions that have been rapidly increasing in importance.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization will not only improve the staff resources available to the President, but will also strengthen the advisory roles of those members of the Cabinet principally concerned with domestic affairs. By providing a means of formulating integrated and systematic recommendations on major domestic policy issues, the plan serves not only the needs of the President but also the interests of the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization plan is of major importance to the functioning of modern government. The national interest requires it. I urge that the Congress allow it to become effective.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12803, Apr. 30, 1992, 57 F.R. 19063, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure that the United States achieves the most beneficial economic use of its resources, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Definitions</em>. For purposes of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Privatization&rdquo; means the disposition or transfer of an infrastructure asset, such as by sale or by long-term lease, from a State or local government to a private party.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Infrastructure asset&rdquo; means any asset financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government and <!-- PDFPage:31 -->needed for the functioning of the economy. Examples of such assets include, but are not limited to: roads, tunnels, bridges, electricity supply facilities, mass transit, rail transportation, airports, ports, waterways, water supply facilities, recycling and wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste disposal facilities, housing, schools, prisons, and hospitals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Originally authorized purposes&rdquo; means the general objectives of the original grant program; however, the term is not intended to include every condition required for a grantee to have obtained the original grant.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) &ldquo;Transfer price&rdquo; means: (i) the amount paid or to be paid by a private party for an infrastructure asset, if the asset is transferred as a result of competitive bidding; or (ii) the appraised value of an infrastructure asset, as determined by the head of the executive department or agency and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, if the asset is not transferred as a result of competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) &ldquo;State and local governments&rdquo; means the government of any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, and any county, municipality, city, town, township, local public authority, school district, special district, intrastate district, regional or interstate governmental entity, council of governments, and any agency or instrumentality of a local government, and any federally recognized Indian Tribe.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Fundamental Principles</em>. Executive departments and agencies shall be guided by the following objectives and principles: (a) Adequate and well-maintained infrastructure is critical to economic growth. Consistent with the principles of federalism enumerated in Executive Order No. 12612 [set out under section 601 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees], and in order to allow the private sector to provide for infrastructure modernization and expansion, State and local governments should have greater freedom to privatize infrastructure assets.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Private enterprise and competitively driven improvements are the foundation of our Nation's economy and economic growth. Federal financing of infrastructure assets should not act as a barrier to the achievement of economic efficiencies through additional private market financing or competitive practices, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) State and local governments are in the best position to assess and respond to local needs. State and local governments should, subject to assuring continued compliance with Federal requirements that public use be on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, have maximum possible freedom to make decisions concerning the maintenance and disposition of their federally financed infrastructure assets.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) User fees are generally more efficient than general taxes as a means to support infrastructure assets. Privatization transactions should be structured so as not to result in unreasonable increases in charges to users.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Privatization Initiative</em>. To the extent permitted by law, the head of each executive department and agency shall undertake the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Review those procedures affecting the management and disposition of federally financed infrastructure assets owned by State and local governments and modify those procedures to encourage appropriate privatization of such assets consistent with this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Assist State and local governments in their efforts to advance the objectives of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Approve State and local governments&rsquo; requests to privatize infrastructure assets, consistent with the criteria in section 4 of this order and, where necessary, grant exceptions to the disposition requirements of the &ldquo;Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments&rdquo; common rule, or other relevant rules or regulations, for infrastructure assets; provided that the transfer price shall be distributed, as paid, in the following manner: (i) State and local governments shall first recoup in full the unadjusted dollar amount of their portion of total project costs (including any transaction and fix-up costs they incur) associated with the infrastructure asset involved; (ii) if proceeds remain, then the Federal Government shall recoup in full the amount of Federal grant awards associated with the infrastructure asset, less the applicable share of accumulated depreciation on such asset (calculated using the Internal Revenue Service accelerated depreciation schedule for the categories of assets in question); and (iii) finally, the State and local governments shall keep any remaining proceeds.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Criteria</em>. To the extent permitted by law, the head of an executive department or agency shall approve a request in accordance with section 3(c) of this order only if the grantee: (a) Agrees to use the proceeds described in section 3(c)(iii) of this order only for investment in additional infrastructure assets (after public notice of the proposed investment), or for debt or tax reduction; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Demonstrates that a market mechanism, legally enforceable agreement, or regulatory mechanism will ensure that: (i) the infrastructure asset or assets will continue to be used for their originally authorized purposes, as long as needed for those purposes, even if the purchaser becomes insolvent or is otherwise hindered from fulfilling the originally authorized purposes; and (ii) user charges will be consistent with any current Federal conditions that protect users and the public by limiting the charges.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Government-wide Coordination and Review</em>. In implementing Executive Order Nos. 12291 and 12498 [formerly set out under section 601 of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees] and OMB Circular No. A&ndash;19, the Office of Management and Budget, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the provisions of those authorities, shall take action to ensure that the policies of the executive department and agencies are consistent with the principles, criteria, and requirements of this order. The Office of Management and Budget shall review the results of implementing this order and report thereon to the President 1 year after the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Preservation of Existing Authority</em>. Nothing in this order is in any way intended to limit any existing authority of the heads of executive departments and agencies to approve privatization proposals that are otherwise consistent with law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch, and is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12893, Jan. 26, 1994, 59 F.R. 4233, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">A well-functioning infrastructure is vital to sustained economic growth, to the quality of life in our communities, and to the protection of our environment and natural resources. To develop and maintain its infrastructure facilities, our Nation relies heavily on investments by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Our Nation will achieve the greatest benefits from its infrastructure facilities if it invests wisely and continually improves the quality and performance of its infrastructure programs. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Scope</em>. The principles and plans referred to in this order shall apply to Federal spending for infrastructure programs. For the purposes of this order, Federal spending for infrastructure programs shall include direct spending and grants for transportation, water resources, energy, and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Principles of Federal Infrastructure Investment.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">Each executive department and agency with infrastructure responsibilities (hereinafter referred to collectively as &ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) shall develop and implement plans for infrastructure investment and management consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Systematic Analysis of Expected Benefits and Costs</em>. Infrastructure investments shall be based on systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs, including both quantitative and qualitative measures, in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Benefits and costs should be quantified and monetized to the maximum extent practicable. All types of benefits and costs, both market and nonmarket, should be considered. To the extent that environmental and other nonmarket benefits and costs can be quantified, they shall be given the same weight as quantifiable market benefits and costs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Benefits and costs should be measured and appropriately discounted over the full life cycle of each project. Such analysis will enable informed tradeoffs among capital outlays, operating and maintenance costs, and nonmonetary costs borne by the public.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) When the amount and timing of important benefits and costs are uncertain, analyses shall recognize the uncertainty and address it through appropriate quantitative and qualitative assessments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) Analyses shall compare a comprehensive set of options that include, among other things, managing demand, repairing facilities, and expanding facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) Analyses should consider not only quantifiable measures of benefits and costs, but also qualitative measures reflecting values that are not readily quantified.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Efficient Management</em>. Infrastructure shall be managed efficiently in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) The efficient use of infrastructure depends not only on physical design features, but also on operational practices. To improve these practices, agencies should conduct periodic reviews of the operation and maintenance of existing facilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Agencies should use these reviews to consider a variety of management practices that can improve the return from infrastructure investments. Examples include contracting practices that reward quality and innovation, and design standards that incorporate new technologies and construction techniques.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) Agencies also should use these reviews to identify the demand for different levels of infrastructure services. Since efficient levels of service can often best be achieved by properly pricing infrastructure, the Federal Government&mdash;through its direct investments, grants, and regulations&mdash;should promote consideration of market-based mechanisms for managing infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Private Sector Participation</em>. Agencies shall seek private sector participation in infrastructure investment and management. Innovative public-private initiatives can bring about greater private sector participation in the ownership, financing, construction, and operation of the infrastructure programs referred to in section 1 of this order. Consistent with the public interest, agencies should work with State and local entities <!-- PDFPage:36 -->to minimize legal and regulatory barriers to private sector participation in the provision of infrastructure facilities and services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Encouragement of More Effective State and Local Programs</em>. To promote the efficient use of Federal infrastructure funds, agencies should encourage the State and local recipients of Federal grants to implement planning and information management systems that support the principles set forth in section 2(a) through (c) of this order. In turn, the Federal Government should use the information from the State and local recipients&rsquo; management systems to conduct the system-level reviews of the Federal Government's infrastructure programs that are required by this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Submission of Plans</em>. Agencies shall submit initial plans to implement these principles to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (&ldquo;OMB&rdquo;) by March 15, 1994. Agency plans shall list the actions that will be taken to provide the data and analysis necessary for supporting infrastructure-related proposals in future budget submissions. Agency implementation plans should be consistent with OMB Circular A&ndash;94 that outlines the analytical methods required under the principles set forth in section 2 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Application to Budget Submissions</em>. Beginning with the fiscal year 1996 budget submission to OMB, each agency should use these principles to justify major infrastructure investment and grant programs. Major programs are defined as those programs with annual budgetary resources in excess of $50 million.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Application to Legislative Proposals</em>. Beginning March 15, 1994, agencies shall employ the principles set forth in section 2 of this order and, at the request of OMB, shall provide supporting analyses when requesting OMB clearance for legislative proposals that would authorize or reauthorize infrastructure programs.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Guidance</em>. The Office of Management and Budget shall provide guidance to the agencies on the implementation of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body">In clause (1), &ldquo;agency&rdquo; (which is defined for purposes of this title in section 101 to mean a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States) is coextensive with and substituted for the term &ldquo;department or establishment&rdquo; which was defined in 31:2 as in part meaning &ldquo;any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment of the Government, including any independent regulatory commission or board&rdquo;. This definition merely restates and continues, and does not in any way change or expand, the definition in 31:2. Under that definition, entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority that have been interpreted to be outside the purview of the definition will continue to be outside the purview in the same manner and to the same extent that they were under 31:2. The words &ldquo;includes the District of Columbia government&rdquo; are used because of existing law but the inclusion of these words is not to be interpreted as construing the extent to which the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganizational Act (Pub. L. 93&ndash;198, 87 Stat. 774) supersedes the provisions codified in this title. The words &ldquo;of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:2 (2d&ndash;4th pars.) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of section 2 (3d par.) of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20), is omitted as obsolete because of section 501 of the revised title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) refers to particular types of records to be withheld from the Comptroller General; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) by the 20th day after a report is filed under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the President or the Director certifies to the Comptroller General and Congress that a record could be withheld under section 552(b)(5) or (7) of title 5 and disclosure reasonably could be expected to impair substantially the operations of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President or the Director may not delegate certification under paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection. A certification shall include a complete explanation of the reasons for the certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Comptroller General shall maintain the same level of confidentiality for a record made available under this section as is required of the head of the agency from which it is obtained.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after the Comptroller General consults with organizations representing employees of the Office and with any member of each committee of Congress, having legislative jurisdiction over the personnel management system maintained under section 732 of this title, whom the chairman of the committee designates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the term of a member of the Board is 5 years. A member may not be reappointed. An individual appointed to fill a vacancy occurring before the expiration of a term of office is appointed for the remainder of the term. However, if the unexpired part of a term is less than one year, the Comptroller General may appoint an individual for a 5-year term plus the unexpired part of the term. When the term of a member ends, the member may continue to serve until a successor takes office or for 6 months after the term expires, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to the members under subparagraph (A)(ii), which will have a term of 6 years and which will have a term of 7 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A term established for a member under this paragraph shall be measured&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) from the date on which the member was originally appointed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a member serving for the unexpired portion of a term, from the appointment date of the individual who was originally appointed to serve for such term.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A member may be removed by a majority of the Board (except the member subject to removal) only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. A member subject to removal shall be given notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the Board unless the member waives the opportunity in writing.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the section, a reference to 31:71 and 471 is omitted because the definitions in the section are not used in 31:71 and 471.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (1), &ldquo;agency&rdquo; (which is defined for purposes of this title in section 101 to mean a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States) is coextensive with and substituted for the term &ldquo;department or establishment&rdquo; which was defined in 31:2 as in part meaning &ldquo;any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment of the Government, including any independent regulatory commission or board&rdquo;. This definition merely restates and continues, and does not in any way change or expand, the definition in 31:2. Under that definition, entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority that have been interpreted to be outside the purview of the definition will continue to be outside the purview in the same manner and to the same extent that they were under 31:2. The words &ldquo;includes the District of Columbia government&rdquo; are used because of existing law but the inclusion of these words is not to be interpreted as construing the extent to which the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganizational Act (Pub. L. 93&ndash;198, 87 Stat. 774) supersedes the provisions codified in this title. The words &ldquo;of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as surplus. The text of 31:2(2d&ndash;4th pars.) is omitted as unnecessary because of the restatement. The text of section 2(3d par.) of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921 (ch. 18, 42 Stat. 20), is omitted as obsolete because of section 501 of the revised title.</p>

An apportionment may be reapportioned under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An appropriation subject to apportionment is apportioned by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) months, calendar quarters, operating seasons, or other time periods;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In apportioning or reapportioning an appropriation, a reserve may be established only&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as specifically provided by law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A reserve established under this subsection may be changed as necessary to carry out the scope and objectives of the appropriation concerned. When an official designated in section 1513 of this title to make apportionments decides that an amount reserved will not be required to carry out the objectives and scope of the appropriation concerned, the official shall recommend the rescission of the amount in the way provided in chapter 11 of this title for appropriation requests. Reserves established under this section shall be reported to Congress as provided in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.).</p>

Proceeds from the bonds and certificates shall be used for expenditures authorized by law. Savings bonds and certificates may be issued on an interest-bearing basis, on a discount basis, or on an interest-bearing and discount basis. Savings bonds shall mature not more than 20 years from the date of issue. Savings certificates shall mature not more than 10 years from the date of issue. The difference between the price paid and the amount received on redeeming a savings bond or certificate is interest under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations providing that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) owners of savings bonds may keep the bonds after maturity or after a period beyond maturity during which the bonds have earned interest and continue to earn interest at rates consistent with paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) savings bonds earning a different rate of interest before the regulations are prescribed shall earn a rate of interest consistent with paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may prescribe for savings bonds and savings certificates issued under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the form and amount of an issue and series;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the way in which they will be issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the conditions, including restrictions on transfer, to which they will be subject;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is qualified under regulations prescribed by the Secretary in carrying out this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Secretary may prescribe a way in which a check issued to an individual (except a trust or estate) as a refund for taxes imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) may become a series E savings bond.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In issuing obligations under sections 3102&ndash;3104 of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether an obligation is to be issued on an interest-bearing basis, a discount basis, or an interest-bearing and discount basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regulations on the conditions under which the obligation will be offered for sale, including whether it will be offered for sale on a competitive or other basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the offering price and interest rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the method of computing the interest rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the dates for paying principal and interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the form and denominations of the obligations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) other conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation issued under this chapter and redeemable on demand of the owner or holder may be used to pay the United States Government for taxes imposed by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation of the Government issued after March 3, 1971, under law may not be redeemed before its maturity to pay a tax imposed by the Government in an amount more than the fair market value of the obligation at the time of its redemption. This paragraph does not apply to a Treasury bill issued under section 3104 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an obligation authorized by this chapter may be issued in exchange for an obligation of an agency whose principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the Government at or before maturity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may issue registered bonds in exchange for and instead of coupon bonds that have been or may be issued. The registered bonds shall be similar in all respects to the registered bonds issued under a law authorizing the issue of coupon bonds offered for exchange.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A decision of the Secretary about an issue of obligations under sections 3102&ndash;3104 of this title is final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may accept voluntary services in carrying out the sale of public debt obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;registration-required obligation&rdquo; means an obligation except an obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not of a type offered to the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) having a maturity (at issue) of not more than one year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation is not a registration-required obligation if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are arrangements reasonably designed to ensure that the obligation will be sold (or resold in connection with the original issue) only to a person that is not a United States person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for an obligation not in registered form&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) interest on the obligation is payable only outside the United States and its territories and possessions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a statement is on the face of the obligation that a United States person holding the obligation is subject to limitations under the United States income tax laws.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:136 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Every registration-required obligation of the Government shall be in registered form. A book entry obligation is deemed to be in registered form if the right to principal and stated interest on the obligation may be transferred only through a book entry consistent with regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out this subsection when there is a nominee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations issued under this chapter, and obligations otherwise issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States. Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution that is not a government securities broker or a government securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the adequate segregation of obligations so held, including obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or repurchase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Violation of a regulation prescribed under paragraph (1) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3121_1_target" name="3121_1">1</a></sup> of the Home Owners&rsquo; Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3121_1_target" name="3121_1">1</a></sup> of the National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with respect to a depository institution by its appropriate regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured credit union by the National Credit Union Administration Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect in any way the powers of such agencies under any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations under this subsection, determine with respect to each appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board, whether its rules and standards adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated under this subsection, and if the Secretary so determines, shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules or standards from the regulations promulgated under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;depository institution&rdquo; has the meaning stated in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a commercial lending company owned or controlled by a foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the International Banking Act of 1978).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;government securities broker&rdquo; has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) &ldquo;government securities dealer&rdquo; has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) &ldquo;appropriate regulatory agency&rdquo; has the meaning prescribed in section 3(a)(34)(G) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Stocks and obligations of the United States Government are exempt from taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State. The exemption applies to each form of taxation that would require the obligation, the interest on the obligation, or both, to be considered in computing a tax, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a nondiscriminatory franchise tax or another nonproperty tax instead of a franchise tax, imposed on a corporation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an estate or inheritance tax.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The tax status of interest on obligations and dividends, earnings, or other income from <!-- PDFPage:140 -->evidences of ownership issued by the Government or an agency and the tax treatment of gain and loss from the disposition of those obligations and evidences of ownership is decided under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.). An obligation that the Federal Housing Administration had agreed, under a contract made before March 1, 1941, to issue at a future date, has the tax exemption privileges provided by the authorizing law at the time of the contract. This subsection does not apply to obligations and evidences of ownership issued by the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a department, agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of the District, territory, or possession.</p>

The Secretary shall relieve the bank, agent, officer, or employee from liability when the Secretary decides that written notice of liability or potential liability has not been given to the bank, agent, officer, or employee by the Government within 10 years from the date of the erroneous payment. However, the Secretary may not relieve a paying agent of an assumed unconditional liability to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Section 3 of the Government Losses in Shipment Act (40 U.S.C. 723) (related to finality of decisions of the Secretary) applies to a decision of the Secretary made under this section.

Rep. 97&ndash;651 (p. 298) states that the sentence was omitted as superseded by various sections of title 10. Title 10 supersedes the sentence only as it applies to military deposits. However, the language of section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) is subsumed in the broader language of section 3617 of the Revised Statutes, the source credit for 31:3302(b). Therefore, while section 3618 (1st sentence related to non-military deposits) should be a source credit for 31:3302(b), it is not necessary that the language of the sentence be restated.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3554. Decisions on protests</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Comptroller General shall provide for the inexpensive and expeditious resolution of protests under this subchapter. Except as provided under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Comptroller General shall issue a final decision concerning a protest within 125 days after the date the protest is submitted to the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Comptroller General shall, by regulation prescribed pursuant to section 3555 of this title, establish an express option for deciding those protests which the Comptroller General determines suitable for resolution within 65 days after the date the protest is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An amendment to a protest that adds a new ground of protest, if timely made, should be resolved, to the maximum extent practicable, within the time limit established under paragraph (1) of this subsection for final decision of the initial protest. If an amended protest cannot be resolved within such time limit, the Comptroller General may resolve the amended protest through the express option under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Comptroller General may dismiss a protest that the Comptroller General determines is frivolous or which, on its face, does not state a valid basis for protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) With respect to a solicitation for a contract, or a proposed award or the award of a contract, protested under this subchapter, the Comptroller General may determine whether the solicitation, proposed award, or award complies with statute and regulation. If the Comptroller General determines that the solicitation, proposed award, or award does not comply with a statute or regulation, the Comptroller General shall recommend that the Federal agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) refrain from exercising any of its options under the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recompete the contract immediately;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) issue a new solicitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) terminate the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) award a contract consistent with the requirements of such statute and regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) implement any combination of recommendations under clauses (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) implement such other recommendations as the Comptroller General determines to be necessary in order to promote compliance with procurement statutes and regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the head of the procuring activity responsible for a contract makes a finding under section 3553(d)(2)(A)(i)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3554_1_target" name="3554_1">1</a></sup> of this title, the Comptroller General shall make recommendations under this subsection without regard to any cost or disruption from terminating, recompeting, or reawarding the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Federal agency fails to implement fully the recommendations of the Comptroller General under this subsection with respect to a solicitation for a contract or an award or proposed award of a contract within 60 days after receiving the recommendations, the head of the procuring activity responsible for that contract shall report such failure to the Comptroller General not later than 5 days after the end of such 60-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If the Comptroller General determines that a solicitation for a contract or a proposed award or the award of a contract does not comply with a statute or regulation, the Comptroller General may recommend that the Federal agency conducting the procurement pay to an appropriate interested party the costs of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) filing and pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and consultant and expert witness fees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) bid and proposal preparation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No party (other than a small business concern (within the meaning of section 3(a) of the Small Business Act)) may be paid, pursuant to a recommendation made under the authority of paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) costs for consultant and expert witness fees that exceed the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the Federal Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) costs for attorneys&rsquo; fees that exceed $150 per hour unless the agency determines, based on the recommendation of the Comptroller General on a case by case basis, that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Comptroller General recommends under paragraph (1) that a Federal agency pay costs to an interested party, the Federal agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) pay the costs promptly; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the Federal agency does not make such payment, promptly report to the Comptroller General the reasons for the failure to follow the Comptroller General's recommendation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Comptroller General recommends under paragraph (1) that a Federal agency pay costs to an interested party, the Federal agency and the interested party shall attempt to reach an agreement on the amount of the costs to be paid. If the Federal agency and the interested party are unable to agree on the amount to be paid, the Comptroller General may, upon the request of the interested party, recommend to the <!-- PDFPage:179 -->Federal agency the amount of the costs that the Federal agency should pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each decision of the Comptroller General under this subchapter shall be signed by the Comptroller General or a designee for that purpose. A copy of the decision shall be made available to the interested parties, the head of the procuring activity responsible for the solicitation, proposed award, or award of the contract, and the senior procurement executive of the Federal agency involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Comptroller General shall report promptly to the Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and to the Committee on Government Operations and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives any case in which a Federal agency fails to implement fully a recommendation of the Comptroller General under subsection (b) or (c). The report shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a comprehensive review of the pertinent procurement, including the circumstances of the failure of the Federal agency to implement a recommendation of the Comptroller General; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a recommendation regarding whether, in order to correct an inequity or to preserve the integrity of the procurement process, the Congress should consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) private relief legislation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) legislative rescission or cancellation of funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) further investigation by Congress; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) other action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than January 31 of each year, the Comptroller General shall transmit to the Congress a report containing a summary of each instance in which a Federal agency did not fully implement a recommendation of the Comptroller General under subsection (b) or (c) during the preceding year. The report shall also describe each instance in which a final decision in a protest was not rendered within 125 days after the date the protest is submitted to the Comptroller General.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may compromise a claim of the Government of not more than $100,000 (excluding interest) or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe that has not been referred to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may suspend or end collection action on a claim referred to in clause (2) of this subsection when it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective ability to pay a significant amount of the claim or the cost of collecting the claim is likely to be more than the amount recovered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Comptroller General has the same authority that the head of the agency has under subsection (a) of this section when the claim is referred to the Comptroller General for further collection action. Only the Comptroller General may compromise a claim arising out of an exception the Comptroller General makes in the account of an accountable official.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The head of an executive or legislative agency may not act under subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this section on a claim that appears to be fraudulent, false, or misrepresented by a party with an interest in the claim, or that is based on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation may not compromise for less than $500 a penalty under section 21302 of title 49 for a violation of chapter 203, 205, or 207 of title 49 or a regulation or requirement prescribed or order issued under any of those chapters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A compromise under this section is final and conclusive unless gotten by fraud, misrepresentation, presenting a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The head of an executive or legislative agency acts under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regulations prescribed by the head of the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) standards that the Attorney General and the Comptroller General may prescribe jointly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) When trying to collect a claim of the Government under a law except the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the head of an executive or legislative agency may disclose to a consumer reporting agency information from a system of records that an individual is responsible for a claim if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that payment of the claim is overdue;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that, within not less than 60 days after sending the notice, the head of the agency intends to disclose to a consumer reporting agency that the individual is responsible for the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) of the specific information to be disclosed to the consumer reporting agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) of the rights the individual has to a complete explanation of the claim, to dispute information in the records of the agency about the claim, and to administrative repeal or review of the claim;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the individual has not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) repaid or agreed to repay the claim under a written repayment plan that the individual has signed and the head of the agency has agreed to; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) filed for review of the claim under paragraph (2) of this subsection;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the head of the agency has established procedures to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) disclose promptly, to each consumer reporting agency to which the original disclosure was made, a substantial change in the condition or amount of the claim;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) verify or correct promptly information about the claim on request of a consumer reporting agency for verification of information disclosed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) get satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting agency that the agency is complying with all laws of the United States related to providing consumer credit information; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the information disclosed to the consumer reporting agency is limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) information necessary to establish the identity of the individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount, status, and history of the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the agency or program under which the claim arose.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection and at other times allowed by law, the head of an executive or legislative agency shall provide, on request of an individual alleged by the agency to be responsible for the claim, for a review of the obligation of the individual, including an opportunity for reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the head of an executive or legislative agency shall take reasonable action to locate an individual for whom the head of the agency does not have a current address to send the notice under paragraph (1)(C).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3718. Contracts for collection services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under conditions the head of an executive or legislative agency considers appropriate, the head of the agency may make a contract with a person for collection services to recover indebtedness owed the United States Government. The contract shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the head of the agency retains the authority to resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection action, and refer a matter to the Attorney General to bring a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person is subject to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) section 552a of title 5, to the extent provided in section 552a(m); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) laws and regulations of the United States Government and State governments related to debt collection practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) The Attorney General may make contracts retaining private counsel to furnish legal services, including representation in negotiation, compromise, settlement, and litigation, in the case of any claim of indebtedness owed the United States. Each such contract shall include such terms and conditions as the Attorney General considers necessary and appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or the method for calculating that fee. The amount of the fee payable for legal services furnished under any such contract may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is an individual or a business entity. If the Attorney General makes a contract for legal services to be furnished in any judicial district of the United States under the first sentence of this paragraph, the Attorney General shall use his best efforts to obtain, from among attorneys regularly engaged in the private practice of law in such district, at least four such contracts for legal services with private individuals or firms in such district. Nothing in this subparagraph shall relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements set forth in title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 and following).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, so as to enable each agency to comply with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an executive or legislative agency may, subject to the approval of the Attorney General, refer to a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection claims of indebtedness owed the United States arising out of activities of that agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each agency shall use its best efforts to assure that not less than 10 percent of the amounts of all claims referred to private counsel by that agency under paragraph (2) are referred to law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;law firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) and regulations issued under those clauses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;socially and economically disadvantaged individuals&rdquo; shall be presumed to include these groups and individuals described in the last paragraph of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection may represent the United States in litigation in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A contract made with a private counsel under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a provision permitting the Attorney General to terminate either the contract or the private counsel's representation of the United States in particular cases if the Attorney General finds that such action is for the convenience of the Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a provision stating that the head of the executive or legislative agency which refers a claim under the contract retains the authority to resolve a dispute regarding the claim, to compromise the claim, or to terminate a collection action on the claim; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a provision requiring the private counsel to transmit monthly to the Attorney General and the head of the executive or legislative agency referring a claim under the contract a report on the services relating to the claim rendered under the contract during the month and the progress made during the month in collecting the claim under the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of section 803(6) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692a(6)), a private counsel performing legal services pursuant to a contract made under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be considered to be a debt collector for the purposes of such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any counterclaim filed in any action to recover indebtedness owed the United States which is brought on behalf of the United States by private counsel retained under this subsection may not be asserted unless the counterclaim is served directly on the Attorney General or the United States Attorney for the judicial district in which, or embracing the place in which, the action is brought. Such service shall be made in accordance with the rules of procedure of the court in which the action is brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Attorney General shall transmit to the Congress an annual report on the activities of the Department of Justice to recover indebtedness owed the United States which was referred to the Department of Justice for collection. Each such report shall include a list, by agency, of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:190 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total number and amounts of claims which were referred for legal services to the Department of Justice and to private counsel under subsection (b) during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to the Department of Justice which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the total number and amount of those claims referred for legal services to private counsel under subsection (b)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which were collected or were not collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by the report;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which were not collected or otherwise resolved under a contract terminated by the Attorney General during the 1-year period covered by the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on which the Attorney General terminated the private counsel's representation during the 1-year period covered by the report without terminating the contract with the private counsel under which the claims were referred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of this title, a contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may provide that a fee a person charges to recover indebtedness owed the United States Government is payable from the amount recovered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is effective only to the extent and in the amount provided in an appropriation law. This limitation does not apply in the case of a contract that authorizes a person to collect a fee as provided in subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not apply to the collection of debts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) In order to assist Congress in determining whether use of private counsel is a cost-effective method of collecting Government debts, the Attorney General shall, following consultation with the General Accounting Office, maintain and make available to the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, statistical data relating to the comparative costs of debt collection by participating United States Attorneys&rsquo; Offices and by private counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of State may waive the settlement and payment limitation referred to in paragraph (1) for claims for damage or loss by United States Government personnel under the jurisdiction of a chief of mission in a foreign country if such claims arise in circumstances where there is in effect a departure from the country authorized or ordered under circumstances described in section 5522(a) of title 5, if the Secretary determines that there exists exceptional circumstances that warrant such a waiver.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) The President may prescribe policies to carry out this section (except subsection (b) to the extent that subsection (b) applies to the military departments, the Department of Defense, and the Coast Guard). Subject to those <!-- PDFPage:195 -->policies, the head of each agency shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a transfer or assignment of any part of a claim against the United States Government or of an interest in the claim; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authorization to receive payment for any part of the claim.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An assignment may be made only after a claim is allowed, the amount of the claim is decided, and a warrant for payment of the claim has been issued. The assignment shall specify the warrant, must be made freely, and must be attested to by 2 witnesses. The person making the assignment shall acknowledge it before an official who may acknowledge a deed, and the official shall certify the assignment. The certificate shall state that the official completely explained the assignment when it was acknowledged. An assignment under this subsection is valid for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to an assignment to a financing institution of money due or to become due under a contract providing for payments totaling at least $1,000 when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contract does not forbid an assignment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, the assignment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is for the entire amount not already paid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is made to only one party, except that it may be made to a party as agent or trustee for more than one party participating in the financing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may not be reassigned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the assignee files a written notice of the assignment and a copy of the assignment with the contracting official or the head of the agency, the surety on a bond on the contract, and any disbursing official for the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) During a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by law and ended by proclamation or law, a contract with the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy (when carrying out duties and powers formerly carried out by the Atomic Energy Commission), or other agency the President designates may provide, or may be changed without consideration to provide, that a future payment under the contract to an assignee is not subject to reduction or setoff. A payment subsequently due under the contract (even after the war or emergency is ended) shall be paid to the assignee without a reduction or setoff for liability of the assignor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the Government independent of the contract; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of renegotiation, fine, penalty (except an amount that may be collected or withheld under, or because the assignor does not comply with, the contract), taxes, social security contributions, or withholding or failing to withhold taxes or social security contributions, arising from, or independent of, the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) An assignee under this section does not have to make restitution of, refund, or repay the amount received because of the liability of the assignor to the Government that arises from or is independent of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Government may not collect or reclaim money paid to a person receiving an amount under an assignment or allotment of pay or allowances authorized by law when liability may exist because of the death of the person making the assignment or allotment.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3730. Civil actions for false claims</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Responsibilities of the Attorney General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General diligently shall investigate a violation under section 3729. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a civil action under this section against the person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions by Private Persons</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Government pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The Government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) proceed with the action, in which case the action shall be conducted by the Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) When a person brings an action under this subsection, no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Rights of the Parties to Qui Tam Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action. Such person shall have the right to continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the person has been notified by the Government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Government may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the action if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon a showing by the Government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Government's prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:204 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. If the Government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the action, the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the Government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the Government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the Government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the United States, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Award to Qui Tam Plaintiff</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_1_target" name="3730_1">1</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Government does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of section 3729, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United States to continue the action, represented by the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Certain Actions Barred</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought by a former or present member of the armed <!-- PDFPage:205 -->forces under subsection (b) of this section against a member of the armed forces arising out of such person's service in the armed forces.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under subsection (b) against a Member of Congress, a member of the judiciary, or a senior executive branch official if the action is based on evidence or information known to the Government when the action was brought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;senior executive branch official&rdquo; means any officer or employee listed in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 101(f) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In no event may a person bring an action under subsection (b) which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the Government is already a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3730_2_target" name="3730_2">2</a></sup> Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;original source&rdquo; means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Government Not Liable for Certain Expenses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Government is not liable for expenses which a person incurs in bringing an action under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Fees and Expenses to Prevailing Defendant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In civil actions brought under this section by the United States, the provisions of section 2412(d) of title 28 shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Any employee who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under this section, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole. Such relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. An employee may bring an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for the relief provided in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Issuance and service</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that any person may be in possession, custody, or control of any documentary material or information relevant to a false claims law investigation, the Attorney General may, before commencing a civil proceeding under section 3730 or other false claims law, issue in writing and cause to be served upon such person, a civil investigative demand requiring such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to produce such documentary material for inspection and copying,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to answer in writing written interrogatories with respect to such documentary material or information,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to give oral testimony concerning such documentary material or information, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to furnish any combination of such material, answers, or testimony.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Attorney General may not delegate the authority to issue civil investigative demands under this subsection. Whenever a civil investigative demand is an express demand for any product of discovery, the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an Assistant Attorney General shall cause to be served, in any manner authorized by this section, a copy of such demand upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained and shall notify the person to whom such demand is issued of the date on which such copy was served.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Contents and deadlines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Each civil investigative demand issued under paragraph (1) shall state the nature of the conduct constituting the alleged violation of a false claims law which is under investigation, and the applicable provision of law alleged to be violated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If such demand is for the production of documentary material, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) describe each class of documentary material to be produced with such definiteness and certainty as to permit such material to be fairly identified;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) identify the false claims law investigator to whom such material shall be made available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) If such demand is for answers to written interrogatories, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) set forth with specificity the written interrogatories to be answered;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If such demand is for the giving of oral testimony, the demand shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prescribe a date, time, and place at which oral testimony shall be commenced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) identify a false claims law investigator who shall conduct the examination and the custodian to whom the transcript of such examination shall be submitted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) specify that such attendance and testimony are necessary to the conduct of the investigation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) notify the person receiving the demand of the right to be accompanied by an attorney and any other representative; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) describe the general purpose for which the demand is being issued and the general nature of the testimony, including the primary areas of inquiry, which will be taken pursuant to the demand.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any civil investigative demand issued under this section which is an express demand for any product of discovery shall not be returned or returnable until 20 days after a copy of such demand has been served upon the person from whom the discovery was obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The date prescribed for the commencement of oral testimony pursuant to a civil investigative demand issued under this section shall be a date which is not less than seven days after the date on which demand is received, unless the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General determines that exceptional circumstances are present which warrant the commencement of such testimony within a lesser period of time.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:208 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The Attorney General shall not authorize the issuance under this section of more than one civil investigative demand for oral testimony by the same person unless the person requests otherwise or unless the Attorney General, after investigation, notifies that person in writing that an additional demand for oral testimony is necessary. The Attorney General may not, notwithstanding section 510 of title 28, authorize the performance, by any other officer, employee, or agency, of any function vested in the Attorney General under this subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the standards applicable to discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that the application of such standards to any such demand is appropriate and consistent with the provisions and purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Effect on other orders, rules, and laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any such demand which is an express demand for any product of discovery supersedes any inconsistent order, rule, or provision of law (other than this section) preventing or restraining disclosure of such product of discovery to any person. Disclosure of any product of discovery pursuant to any such express demand does not constitute a waiver of any right or privilege which the person making such disclosure may be entitled to invoke to resist discovery of trial preparation materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Service; Jurisdiction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>By whom served</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (a) may be served by a false claims law investigator, or by a United States marshal or a deputy marshal, at any place within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.</p>

To the extent that the courts of the United States can assert jurisdiction over any such person consistent with due process, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section by any such person that such court would have if such person were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed under section 3903 of this title, the head of an agency acquiring property or service from a business concern, who does not pay the concern for each complete delivered item of property or service by the required payment date, shall pay an interest penalty to the concern on the amount of the payment due. The interest shall be computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest payments under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611), which is in effect at the time the agency accrues the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in section 3906 of this title, the interest penalty shall be paid for the period beginning on the day after the required payment date and ending on the date on which payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A business concern shall be entitled to an interest penalty of $1.00 or more which is owed such business concern under this section, and such penalty shall be paid without regard to whether the business concern has requested payment of such penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each payment subject to this chapter for which a late payment interest penalty is required to be paid shall be accompanied by a notice stating the amount of the interest penalty included in such payment and the rate by which, and period for which, such penalty was computed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a business concern&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is owed an interest penalty by an agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not paid the interest penalty in a payment made to the business concern by the agency on or after the date on which the interest penalty becomes due;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is not paid the interest penalty by the agency within 10 days after the date on which such payment is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the date on which such payment is made, that the agency pay such a penalty,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such business concern shall be entitled to an amount equal to the sum of the late payment interest penalty to which the contractor is entitled and an additional penalty equal to a percentage of such late payment interest penalty specified by regulation by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, subject to such maximum as may be specified in such regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely payment due for property or services does not relieve the head of an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An amount of an interest penalty unpaid after any 30-day period shall be added to the principal amount of the debt, and a penalty accrues thereafter on the added amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) This section does not authorize the appropriation of additional amounts to pay an inter<!-- PDFPage:223 -->est penalty. The head of an agency shall pay a penalty under this section out of amounts made available to carry out the program for which the penalty is incurred.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) If a prime contractor, after making payment to a first-tier subcontractor, receives from a supplier or subcontractor of the first-tier sub<!-- PDFPage:228 -->contractor (hereafter referred to as a &ldquo;second-tier subcontractor&rdquo;) a written notice in accordance with section 2 of the Act of August 24, 1935 (40 U.S.C. 270b), asserting a deficiency in such first-tier subcontractor's performance under the contract for which the prime contractor may be ultimately liable, and the prime contractor determines that all or a portion of future payments otherwise due such first-tier subcontractor is subject to withholding in accordance with the subcontract agreement, then the prime contractor may, without incurring an obligation to pay an interest penalty under subsection (e)(6) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) furnish to the first-tier subcontractor a notice conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this section as soon as practicable upon making such determination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) withhold from the first-tier subcontractor's next available progress payment or payments an amount not to exceed the amount specified in the notice of withholding furnished under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable, but not later than 7 days after receipt of satisfactory written notification that the identified subcontract performance deficiency has been corrected, the prime contractor shall pay the amount withheld under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection to such first-tier subcontractor, or shall incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty to such first-tier subcontractor computed at the rate specified by section 3902(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the specific causes for the withholding under the terms of the subcontract; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A prime contractor may not request payment from the agency of any amount withheld or retained in accordance with subsection (d) of this section until such time as the prime contractor has determined and certified to the agency that the subcontractor is entitled to the payment of such amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A dispute between a contractor and subcontractor relating to the amount or entitlement of a subcontractor to a payment or a late payment interest penalty under a clause included in the subcontract pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section does not constitute a dispute to which the United States is a party. The United States may not be interpleaded in any judicial or administrative proceeding involving such a dispute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, this section shall not limit or impair any contractual, administrative, or judicial remedies otherwise available to a contractor or a subcontractor in the event of a dispute involving late payment or nonpayment by a prime contractor or deficient subcontract performance or nonperformance by a subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) A contractor's obligation to pay an interest penalty to a subcontractor pursuant to the clauses included in a subcontract under subsection (b) or (c) of this section may not be construed to be an obligation of the United States for such interest penalty. A contract modification may not be made for the purpose of providing reimbursement of such interest penalty. A cost reimbursement claim may not include any amount for reimbursement of such interest penalty.</p>

<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;money&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. As far as can be determined, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; has not been interpreted by any court or Government agency. The phrase was used by Alexander Hamilton in his &ldquo;Report on the Establishment of the Mint&rdquo; (1791). In that Report, Hamilton propounded 6 questions, including:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&nbsp;1st. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thereafter, Hamilton uses the phrases &ldquo;money unit of the United States&rdquo; and &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; interchangeably and in the sense that the phrases are used to denote the monetary system for keeping financial accounts. In short, the phrases simply indicate that financial accounts are to be based on a decimal money system:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;., and it is certain that nothing can be more simple and convenient than the decimal subdivisions. There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding coins. On this plan the unit in the money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution [of August 8, 1786], a dollar, and its multiples, dimes, cents, and mills, or tenths, hundreths, [sic] and thousands.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the phrase &ldquo;money of account&rdquo; did not mean, by itself, that dollars or fractions of dollars must be equal to something having intrinsic or &ldquo;substantive&rdquo; value. This concept is supported by earlier writings of Thomas Jefferson in his &ldquo;Notes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States&rdquo; (1784), and the 1782 report to the President of the Continental Congress on the coinage of the United States by the Superintendent of Finances, Robert Morris, which was apparently prepared by the Assistant Superintendent, Gouverneur Morris. See Paul L. Ford, <em>The Writings of Thomas Jefferson</em>, vol. III (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1894) pp. 446&ndash;457; William G. Sumner, <em>The Financier and the Finances of the American Revolution</em>, vol. II (Burt Franklin, 1891, reprinted 1970) pp. 36&ndash;47; and George T. Curtis, <em>History of the Constitution</em>, vol. I (Harper and Brothers, 1859) p. 443, n2. The words &ldquo;or units&rdquo; and &ldquo;and all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words before clause (1) are added because of the restatement. In clause (5), the words &ldquo;that is 0.835 inch in diameter&rdquo; are added because the Secretary of the Treasury has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words &ldquo;5 grams&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;seventy-seven and sixteen-hundredths grains troy&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. In clause (6), the words &ldquo;that is 0.75 inch in diameter&rdquo; are added because the Secretary has prescribed the diameter and the diameter of a coin may not be changed under 31:276. The words &ldquo;except as provided under subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;3.11 grams&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;forty-eight grains&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;In minting 5-cent coins&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;in minor-coinage alloys&rdquo; in 31:346 because 5-cent coins are the minor coins composed of nickel. The words &ldquo;Secretary shall use&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;shall be used&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321 of the revised title. The word &ldquo;bars&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;ingots&rdquo; for consistency in the revised chapter. The words &ldquo;2.5 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;twenty-five thousandths&rdquo; for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;from the percent of nickel required&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the legal standard .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the proportion of nickel&rdquo; because of the restatement. The words &ldquo;In silver ingots, six-thousandths&rdquo; are omitted as superseded by the source provisions restated in the section. The words &ldquo;In gold ingots, one-thousandth&rdquo; in section 3533 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because gold coinage was discontinued by 31:315b. The words &ldquo;Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section&rdquo; are added for clarity and because of the restatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;a different weight and alloy of copper and zinc&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;such action&rdquo; for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(1), the words &ldquo;an impression emblematic of liberty&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted as obsolete.

The words &ldquo;Any coins minted after <!-- PDFPage:237 -->July 23, 1965, from 900 fine coin silver shall be inscribed with the year 1964&rdquo; in 31:324 are omitted because the Secretary no longer has authority to mint coins from 900 fine coin silver.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d)(2), the word &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;engraver&rdquo;, &ldquo;Director of the Mint&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Director of the Mint .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury&rdquo; because of the source provisions restated in section 321(c) of the revised title. The word &ldquo;dies&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;from the original dies already authorized all the working dies required for use in the coinage of the several mints&rdquo; and &ldquo;original dies&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The word &ldquo;inscription&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;legend&rdquo; for consistency in the section. The words &ldquo;<em>Provided</em>, That no change be made in the diameter of any coin&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary because the diameters are prescribed by subsection (a) of the revised section. The words &ldquo;procure services under section 3109 of title 5 in carrying out this paragraph&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;engage temporarily for this purpose the services of one or more artists, distinguished in their respective departments of art&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words. The words &ldquo;who shall be paid for such service from the contingent appropriation for the mint at Philadelphia&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. The text of section 3510(2d proviso) of the Revised Statutes is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e)(2), the words &ldquo;80 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;eight hundred parts&rdquo; in 31:391(d), and the words &ldquo;20 percent&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;two hundred parts&rdquo;, for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the Code.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of the Treasury may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a search warrant when the Secretary reasonably believes a monetary instrument is being transported and a report on the instrument under section 5316 of this title has not been filed or contains a material omission or misstatement. The Secretary shall include a statement of information in support of the warrant. On a showing of probable cause, the court may issue a search warrant for a designated person or a designated or described place or physical object. This subsection does not affect the authority of the Secretary under another law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Searches at Border</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of ensuring compliance with the requirements of section 5316, a customs officer may stop and search, at the border and without a search warrant, any vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other conveyance, any envelope or other container, and any person entering or departing from the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) If a report required under section 5316 with respect to any monetary instrument is not filed (or if filed, contains a material omission or misstatement of fact), the instrument and any interest in property, including a deposit in a financial institution, traceable to such instrument may be seized and forfeited to the United States Government. Any property, real or personal, involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section 5324(b), or any property traceable to such property, may be seized and forfeited to the United States Government. A monetary instrument transported by mail or a common carrier, messenger, or bailee is being transported under this subsection from the time the instrument is delivered to the United States Postal Service, common carrier, messenger, or bailee through the time it is delivered to the addressee, intended recipient, or agent of the addressee or intended recipient without being transported further in, or taken out of, the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall issue regulations establishing procedures and requirements for implementing this section with respect to a State with which no agreement is entered into by the Secretary under paragraph (1). Such regulations shall apply to a State until such time as the Secretary enters into an agreement with the State under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary shall issue regulations that shall require a State, when not inconsistent with program purposes, to pay interest to the United States on funds from the time funds are deposited by the United States to the State's account until the time that funds are paid out by the State in order to redeem checks or warrants or make payments by other means for program purposes. Except as provided under paragraph (3)(B) (relating to the Unemployment Trust Fund), the interest payable under this subsection shall be calculated at a rate equal to the average of the bond equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the period for which interest is calculated, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) If a State disburses its own funds for program purposes in accordance with Federal law, Federal regulation, or Federal-State agreement, the State shall be entitled to interest from the time the State's funds are paid out to redeem checks or warrants, or make payments by other means, until the Federal funds are deposited to the State's bank account. The Secretary shall pay, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as may be necessary for interest owed to a State under this subsection. Such interest shall be calculated, at a rate equal to the average of the bond equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the period for which interest is calculated, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If interest is paid under this subsection as a result of a State disbursing its own funds before receiving payment from a trust fund for which the Secretary of the Treasury is the trustee, such interest shall be charged against such trust fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The budget submitted by the President under section 1105 of this title for a fiscal year shall include a statement specifying, for the most recently completed fiscal year, amounts of interest accrued to the Federal Government under subsection (c) and amounts of interest paid to States under subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) If a State receives refunds of funds disbursed by the State under a Federal program, the State shall return those refunds to the Federal executive agency administering the program or apply those refunds to reduce the amount of funds owed by the Federal Government to the State under such program. Interest earned on such refunds shall be considered when setting overall interest obligations between the State and the Federal Government as required by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If the Federal Government makes a payment to a recipient under a Federal program, and a portion of the payment is an amount which the Federal Government is paying to such recipient on behalf of a State, such amount shall be considered to be a transfer of funds between the Federal Government and the State for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A State may not be required by a law or regulation of the United States to deposit funds received by it in a separate bank account. However, a State shall account for funds made available to the State as United States Government funds in the accounts of the State. The head of the State agency concerned shall make periodic authenticated reports to the head of the appropriate Federal executive agency on the status and the application of the funds, the liabilities and obligations on hand, and other information required by the head of the executive agency. Records related to the funds received by the State shall be made available to the head of the executive agency, the Inspector General of the executive agency, and the Comptroller General for necessary audits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Secretary shall prescribe methods for the payment of interest under this section between the Federal Government and the States, including provisions for offsetting amounts owed by the respective parties. Such methods of payment shall require payment of interest on an annual basis and shall provide for comparable treatment in manner, technique, and timing for both the States and the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Consistent with Federal program purposes and regulations of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of a Federal executive agency carrying out a program shall execute grant awards to States on a timely basis to assure the availability of funds to accomplish transfers in compliance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. To the extent the States, in consultation with local general purpose governments, and local special purpose governments they consider appropriate, develop their own processes or refine existing processes for State and local elected officials to review and coordinate proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development, the Federal agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Utilize the State process to determine official views of State and local elected officials.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Communicate with State and local elected officials as early in the program planning cycle as is reasonably feasible to explain specific plans and actions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Make efforts to accommodate State and local elected officials&rsquo; concerns with proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development that are communicated through the designated State process. For those cases where the concerns cannot be accommodated, Federal officials shall explain the bases for their decision in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Allow the States to simplify and consolidate existing Federally required State plan submissions. Where State planning and budgeting systems are sufficient and where permitted by law, the substitution of State plans for Federally required State plans shall be encouraged by the agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Seek the coordination of views of affected State and local elected officials in one State with those of another State when proposed Federal financial assistance or direct Federal development has an impact on interstate metropolitan urban centers or other interstate areas. Existing interstate mechanisms that are redesignated as part of the State process may be used for this purpose.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Support State and local governments by discouraging the reauthorization or creation of any planning organization which is Federally-funded, which has a Federally-prescribed membership, which is established for a limited purpose, and which is not adequately representative of, or accountable to, State or local elected officials.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) The State process referred to in Section 2 shall include those where States delegate, in specific instances, to local elected officials the review, coordination, and communication with Federal agencies.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4.

The Office of Management and Budget shall disseminate such lists to the Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) Agencies shall propose rules and regulations governing the formulation, evaluation, and review of proposed Federal financial assistance and direct Federal development pursuant to this Order, to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval.</p>

The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations, if any, as he deems appropriate for the effective implementation and administration of this Order and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 [31 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.]. The Director is also authorized to exercise the authority vested in the President by Section 401(a) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4231(a)) [31 U.S.C. 6506(a) and (b)] in a manner consistent with this Order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) In addition to payments the Secretary of the Interior makes under section 6902 of this title, the Secretary shall make a payment for each fiscal year to a unit of general local government collecting and distributing real property taxes (including a unit in Alaska outside the boundaries of an organized borough) in which is located an interest in land that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States Government acquires for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the National Park System; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the National Forest Wilderness Areas; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) was subject to local real property taxes within the 5-year period before the interest is acquired.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary shall make payments only for the 5 fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the interest in land is acquired. Under guidelines the Secretary prescribes, the unit of general local government receiving the payment from the Secretary shall distribute payments proportionally to units and school districts that lost real property taxes because of the acquisition of the interest. A unit receiving a distribution may use a payment for any governmental purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each yearly payment by the Secretary under this section is equal to one percent of the fair market value of the interest in land on the date the Government acquires the interest. However, a payment may not be more than the amount of real property taxes levied on the property during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest is acquired. A decision on fair market value under this section may not include an increase in the value of an interest because the land is rezoned when the rezoning causes the increase after the date of enactment of a law authorizing the acquisition of an interest under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments may be made to units of general local government when subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not carry out the purpose of subsections (a) and (b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) An audit conducted in accordance with this chapter shall be in lieu of any financial or financial and compliance audit of an individual Federal assistance program which a State or local government is required to conduct under any other Federal law or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation, a Federal agency shall rely upon and use that information and plan and conduct its own audits accordingly in order to avoid a duplication of effort.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a Federal agency shall conduct any additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation. The provisions of this chapter do not authorize any State or local government (or subrecipient thereof) to constrain, in any manner, such agency from carrying out such additional audits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this chapter do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or enter into contracts for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal financial assistance programs, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal audit official.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subsection (a) shall apply to a State or local government which conducts an audit in accordance with this chapter even though it is not required by section 7502(a) to conduct such audit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A Federal agency that performs or contracts for audits in addition to the audits conducted by recipients pursuant to this chapter shall, consistent with other applicable law, arrange for funding the cost of such additional audits. Such additional audits include economy and efficiency audits, program results audits, and program evaluations.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If a person is required under a law of the United States to give a surety bond, the person may give a Government obligation as security instead of a surety bond. The obligation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be given to the official having authority to approve the surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be in an amount equal at par value to the amount of the required surety bond; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authorize the official receiving the obligation to collect or sell the obligation if the person defaults on a required condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An official receiving a Government obligation under subsection (a) of this section may deposit it with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a Federal reserve bank; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a depositary designated by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, bank, or depositary shall issue a receipt that describes the obligation deposited.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Using a Government obligation instead of a surety bond for security is the same as using&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a personal or corporate surety bond;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a certified check;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a bank draft;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a post office money order; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) cash.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When security is no longer required, a Government obligation given instead of a surety bond shall be returned to the person giving the obligation. If a person, supplying labor or material to a contractor defaulting under the Act of August 24, 1935 (known as the Miller Act) (40 U.S.C. 270a&ndash;270d), files with the United States Government the application and affidavit provided under section 3 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 270c), the Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may return to the contractor the Government obligation given as security (or proceeds of the Government obligation given) under the Act of August 24, 1935 (known as the Miller Act) (40 U.S.C. 270a&ndash;270d), only after the 90-day period for bringing a civil action under section 2 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 270b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a civil action is brought in the 90-day period, shall hold the Government obligation or the proceeds subject to the order of the court having jurisdiction of the action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not affect the&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) priority of a claim of the Government against a Government obligation given under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) right or remedy of the Government for default on an obligation provided under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Act of August 24, 1935 (known as the Miller Act) (40 U.S.C. 270a&ndash;270d); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) authority of a court over a Government obligation given as security in a civil action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) authority of an official of the Government authorized by another law to receive a Government obligation as security.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) To avoid frequent substitution of Government obligations, the Secretary may prescribe regulations limiting the effect of this section to a Government obligation maturing more than one year after the date the obligation is given as security.</p>

However, section 103 applies to a Government pension plan for officers or employees of the Central Intelligence Agency only if the President specifically approves application of the requirements of section 103 in writing. In applying section 103 to a Government pension plan&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a provision providing for waiver of, relief from, or exception to a requirement otherwise applicable to an employee pension benefit plan applies to a Government pension plan only if specifically authorized by the Comptroller General;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) section 104(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1024(b)) does not apply;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) except for a Government pension plan referred to in section 9502(1)(B)(iv)&ndash;(vii) of this title, the Comptroller General shall conduct audits when appropriate instead of complying with the requirements for the independent qualified public accountant.</p>
