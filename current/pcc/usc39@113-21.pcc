I89. Postal policy

I11(a) The United States Postal Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States, authorized by the Constitution, created by Act of Congress, and supported by the people. The Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people. It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to patrons in all areas and shall render postal services to all communities. The costs of establishing and maintaining the Postal Service shall not be apportioned to impair the overall value of such service to the people.

I11(b) The Postal Service shall provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining. No small post office shall be closed solely for operating at a deficit, it being the specific intent of the Congress that effective postal services be insured to residents of both urban and rural communities.

I11(c) As an employer, the Postal Service shall achieve and maintain compensation for its officers and employees comparable to the rates and types of compensation paid in the private sector of the economy of the United States. It shall place particular emphasis upon opportunities for career advancements of all officers and employees and the achievement of worthwhile and satisfying careers in the service of the United States.

I11(d) Postal rates shall be established to apportion the costs of all postal operations to all users of the mail on a fair and equitable basis.

I11(e) In determining all policies for postal services, the Postal Service shall give the highest consideration to the requirement for the most expeditious collection, transportation, and delivery of important letter mail.

I11(f) In selecting modes of transportation, the Postal Service shall give highest consideration to the prompt and economical delivery of all mail. Modern methods of transporting mail by containerization and programs designed to achieve overnight transportation to the destination of important letter mail to all parts of the Nation shall be a primary goal of postal operations.

I11(g) In planning and building new postal facilities, the Postal Service shall emphasize the need for facilities and equipment designed to create desirable working conditions for its officers and employees, a maximum degree of convenience for efficient postal services, proper access to existing and future air and surface transportation facilities, and control of costs to the Postal Service.

I13(iv) the economic savings to the Postal Service resulting from such closing or consolidation; and

I13(v) such other factors as the Postal Service determines are necessary; and

I12(C) unsupported by substantial evidence on the record.

Q04

I10The Commission may affirm the determination of the Postal Service or order that the entire matter be returned for further consideration, but the Commission may not modify the determination of the Postal Service. The Commission may suspend the effectiveness of the determination of the Postal Service until the final disposition of the appeal. The provisions of section 556, section 557, and chapter 7 of title 5 shall not apply to any review carried out by the Commission under this paragraph.

I11(6) For purposes of paragraph (5), any appeal received by the Commission shall_

I12(A) if sent to the Commission through the mails, be considered to have been received on the date of the Postal Service postmark on the envelope or other cover in which such appeal is mailed; or

I12(B) if otherwise lawfully delivered to the Commission, be considered to have been received on the date determined based on any appropriate documentation or other indicia (as determined under regulations of the Commission).

I11(3) Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall review each nonpostal service offered by the Postal Service on the date of enactment of that Act and determine whether that nonpostal service shall continue, taking into account_

I12(A) the public need for the service; and

I12(B) the ability of the private sector to meet the public need for the service.

Q04

I11(4) Any nonpostal service not determined to be continued by the Postal Regulatory Commission under paragraph (3) shall terminate.

I11(5) If the Postal Regulatory Commission authorizes the Postal Service to continue a nonpostal service under this subsection, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall designate whether the service shall be regulated under this title as a market dominant product, a competitive product, or an experimental product.

I11(2) The Postal Service and the supervisors' organization shall strive to resolve any differences concerning the proposal described in paragraph (1) of this subsection under the procedures provided for, or adopted under, subsection (d) of this section.

I11(3) The Postal Service shall provide its decision concerning changes proposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection to the supervisors' organization within 90 days following the submission of the proposal.

I11(f)(1) If, notwithstanding the mutual efforts required by subsection (e) of this section, the supervisors' organization believes that the decision of the Postal Service is not in accordance with the provisions of this title, the organization may, within 10 days following its receipt of such decision, request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to convene a factfinding panel (hereinafter referred to as the ``panel'') concerning such matter.

I21Pub. L. 91ÿ09375, ÿ1A14, Aug. 12, 1970, 84 Stat. 786, provided that:

I21``(a) [T3Congressional findingsK] The Congress finds_

I22``(1) that the United States mails are being used for the indiscriminate dissemination of advertising matter so designed and so presented as to exploit sexual sensationalism for commercial gain;

I22``(2) that such matter is profoundly shocking and offensive to many persons who receive it, unsolicited, through the mails;

I22``(3) that such use of the mails constitutes a serious threat to the dignity and sanctity of the American home and subjects many persons to an unconscionable and unwarranted intrusion upon their fundamental personal right to privacy;

I22``(4) that such use of the mail reduces the ability of responsible parents to protect their minor children from exposure to material which they as parents believe to be harmful to the normal and healthy ethical, mental, and social development of their children; and

I22``(5) that the traffic in such offensive advertisements is so large that individual citizens will be helpless to protect their privacy or their families without stronger and more effective Federal controls over the mailing of such matter.

I21``(b) [T3Congressional Determination of Public PolicyK] On the basis of such findings, the Congress determines that it is contrary to the public policy of the United States for the facilities and services of the United States Postal Service to be used for the distribution of such materials to persons who do not want their privacy invaded in this manner or to persons who wish to protect their minor children from exposure to such material.''

I89. Judicial enforcement

I11(a) Whenever the Postal Service believes that any person is mailing or causing to be mailed any sexually oriented advertisement in violation of section 3010 of this title, it may request the Attorney General to commence a civil action against such person in a district court of the United States. Upon a finding by the court of a violation of that section, the court may issue an order including one or more of the following provisions as the court deems just under the circumstances:

I12(1) a direction to the defendant to refrain from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to a specific addressee, to any group of addressees, or to all persons;

I12(2) a direction to any postmaster to whom sexually oriented advertisements originating with such defendant are tendered for transmission through the mails to refuse to accept such advertisements for mailing; or

I12(3) a direction to any postmaster at the office at which registered or certified letters or other letters or mail arrive, addressed to the defendant or his representative, to return the registered or certified letters or other letters or mail to the sender appropriately marked as being in response to mail in violation of section 3010 of this title, after the defendant, or his representative, has been notified and given reasonable opportunity to examine such letters or mail and to obtain delivery of mail which is clearly not connected with activity alleged to be in violation of section 3010 of this title.

Q04

I11(b) The statement that remittances may be made to a person named in a sexually oriented advertisement is prima facie evidence that such named person is the principal, agent, or representative of the mailer for the receipt of remittances on his behalf. The court is not precluded from ascertaining the existence of the agency on the basis of any other evidence.

I11(c) In preparation for, or during the pendency of, a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, a district court of the United States, upon application therefor by the Attorney General and upon a showing of probable cause to believe the statute is being violated, may enter a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction containing such terms as the court deems just, including, but not limited to, provisions enjoining the defendant from mailing any sexually oriented advertisement to any person or class of persons, directing any postmaster to refuse to accept such defendant's sexually oriented advertisements for mailing, and directing the detention of the defendant's incoming mail by any postmaster pending the conclusion of the judicial proceedings. Any action taken by a court under this subsection does not affect or determine any fact at issue in any other proceeding under this section.

I11(d) A civil action under this section may be brought in the judicial district in which the defendant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in any judicial district in which any sexually oriented advertisement mailed in violation of section 3010 has been delivered by mail according to the direction thereon.

I11(e) Nothing in this section or in section 3010 shall be construed as amending, preempting, limiting, modifying, or otherwise in any way affecting section 1461 or 1463 of title 18 or section 3007 or 3008 of this title.

I80ÿ1A3622

I89. Modern rate regulation

I11(a) T4Authority GenerallyK._The Postal Regulatory Commission shall, within 18 months after the date of enactment of this section, by regulation establish (and may from time to time thereafter by regulation revise) a modern system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products.

I11(b) T4ObjectivesK._Such system shall be designed to achieve the following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction with the others:

I12(1) To maximize incentives to reduce costs and increase efficiency.

I12(2) To create predictability and stability in rates.

I12(3) To maintain high quality service standards established under section 3691.

I12(4) To allow the Postal Service pricing flexibility.

I12(5) To assure adequate revenues, including retained earnings, to maintain financial stability.

I12(6) To reduce the administrative burden and increase the transparency of the ratemaking process.

I12(7) To enhance mail security and deter terrorism.

I12(8) To establish and maintain a just and reasonable schedule for rates and classifications, however the objective under this paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit the Postal Service from making changes of unequal magnitude within, between, or among classes of mail.

I12(9) To allocate the total institutional costs of the Postal Service appropriately between market-dominant and competitive products.

Q04

I11(c) T4FactorsK._In establishing or revising such system, the Postal Regulatory Commission shall take into account_

I12(1) the value of the mail service actually provided each class or type of mail service to both the sender and the recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of transportation, and priority of delivery;

I12(2) the requirement that each class of mail or type of mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to each class or type of mail service through reliably identified causal relationships plus that portion of all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to such class or type;

I12(3) the effect of rate increases upon the general public, business mail users, and enterprises in the private sector of the economy engaged in the delivery of mail matter other than letters;

I12(4) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter at reasonable costs;

I12(5) the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the Postal Service;

I12(6) simplicity of structure for the entire schedule and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees charged the various classes of mail for postal services;

I12(7) the importance of pricing flexibility to encourage increased mail volume and operational efficiency;

I12(8) the relative value to the people of the kinds of mail matter entered into the postal system and the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail;

I12(9) the importance of providing classifications with extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and of providing those that do not require high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery;

I12(10) the desirability of special classifications for both postal users and the Postal Service in accordance with the policies of this title, including agreements between the Postal Service and postal users, when available on public and reasonable terms to similarly situated mailers, that_

I13(A) either_

I14(i) improve the net financial position of the Postal Service through reducing Postal Service costs or increasing the overall contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service; or

I14(ii) enhance the performance of mail preparation, processing, transportation, or other functions; and

Q04

I13(B) do not cause unreasonable harm to the marketplace.

Q04

I12(11) the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value to the recipient of mail matter;

I12(12) the need for the Postal Service to increase its efficiency and reduce its costs, including infrastructure costs, to help maintain high quality, affordable postal services;

I12(13) the value to the Postal Service and postal users of promoting intelligent mail and of secure, sender-identified mail; and

I12(14) the policies of this title as well as such other factors as the Commission determines appropriate.

Q04

I11(d) T4Requirements._

I12(1) T4In generalK._The system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products shall_

I13(A) include an annual limitation on the percentage changes in rates to be set by the Postal Regulatory Commission that will be equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers unadjusted for seasonal variation over the most recent available 12-month period preceding the date the Postal Service files notice of its intention to increase rates;

I13(B) establish a schedule whereby rates, when necessary and appropriate, would change at regular intervals by predictable amounts;

I13(C) not later than 45 days before the implementation of any adjustment in rates under this section, including adjustments made under subsection (c)(10)_

I14(i) require the Postal Service to provide public notice of the adjustment;

I14(ii) provide an opportunity for review by the Postal Regulatory Commission;

I14(iii) provide for the Postal Regulatory Commission to notify the Postal Service of any noncompliance of the adjustment with the limitation under subparagraph (A); and

I14(iv) require the Postal Service to respond to the notice provided under clause (iii) and describe the actions to be taken to comply with the limitation under subparagraph (A);

Q04

I13(D) establish procedures whereby the Postal Service may adjust rates not in excess of the annual limitations under subparagraph (A); and

I13(E) notwithstanding any limitation set under subparagraphs (A) and (C), and provided there is not sufficient unused rate authority under paragraph (2)(C), establish procedures whereby rates may be adjusted on an expedited basis due to either extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, provided that the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing and comment, and within 90 days after any request by the Postal Service, that such adjustment is reasonable and equitable and necessary to enable the Postal Service, under best practices of honest, efficient, and economical management, to maintain and continue the development of postal services of the kind and quality adapted to the needs of the United States.

Q04

I12(2) T4Limitations._

I13(A) T4Classes of mailK._Except as provided under subparagraph (C), the annual limitations under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply to a class of mail, as defined in the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule as in effect on the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.

I13(B) T4Rounding of rates and feesK._Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Postal Service from rounding rates and fees to the nearest whole integer, if the effect of such rounding does not cause the overall rate increase for any class to exceed the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

I13(C) T4Use of unused rate authority._

I14(i) T4DefinitionK._In this subparagraph, the term ``unused rate adjustment authority'' means the difference between_

I16(I) the maximum amount of a rate adjustment that the Postal Service is authorized to make in any year subject to the annual limitation under paragraph (1); and

I16(II) the amount of the rate adjustment the Postal Service actually makes in that year.

Q04

I14(ii) T4AuthorityK._Subject to clause (iii), the Postal Service may use any unused rate adjustment authority for any of the 5 years following the year such authority occurred.

I14(iii) T4LimitationsK._In exercising the authority under clause (ii) in any year, the Postal Service_

I16(I) may use unused rate adjustment authority from more than 1 year;

I16(II) may use any part of the unused rate adjustment authority from any year;

I16(III) shall use the unused rate adjustment authority from the earliest year such authority first occurred and then each following year; and

I16(IV) for any class or service, may not exceed the annual limitation under paragraph (1) by more than 2 percentage points.

Q04

I12(3) T4ReviewK._Ten years after the date of enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act and as appropriate thereafter, the Commission shall review the system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products established under this section to determine if the system is achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c). If the Commission determines, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that the system is not achieving the objectives in subsection (b), taking into account the factors in subsection (c), the Commission may, by regulation, make such modification or adopt such alternative system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products as necessary to achieve the objectives.

Q04

I11(e) T4Workshare Discounts._

I12(1) T4DefinitionK._In this subsection, the term ``workshare discount'' refers to rate discounts provided to mailers for the presorting, prebarcoding, handling, or transportation of mail, as further defined by the Postal Regulatory Commission under subsection (a).

I12(2) T4ScopeK._The Postal Regulatory Commission shall ensure that such discounts do not exceed the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of workshare activity, unless_

I13(A) the discount is_

I14(i) associated with a new postal service, a change to an existing postal service, or with a new work share initiative related to an existing postal service; and

I14(ii) necessary to induce mailer behavior that furthers the economically efficient operation of the Postal Service and the portion of the discount in excess of the cost that the Postal Service avoids as a result of the workshare activity will be phased out over a limited period of time;

Q04

I13(B) the amount of the discount above costs avoided_

I14(i) is necessary to mitigate rate shock; and

I14(ii) will be phased out over time;

Q04

I13(C) the discount is provided in connection with subclasses of mail consisting exclusively of mail matter of educational, cultural, scientific, or informational value; or

I13(D) reduction or elimination of the discount would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service.

Q04

I12(3) T4LimitationK._Nothing in this subsection shall require that a work share discount be reduced or eliminated if the reduction or elimination of the discount would_

I13(A) lead to a loss of volume in the affected category or subclass of mail and reduce the aggregate contribution to the institutional costs of the Postal Service from the category or subclass subject to the discount below what it otherwise would have been if the discount had not been reduced or eliminated; or

I13(B) result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.

Q04

I12(4) T4ReportK._Whenever the Postal Service establishes a workshare discount rate, the Postal Service shall, at the time it publishes the workshare discount rate, submit to the Postal Regulatory Commission a detailed report that_

I13(A) explains the Postal Service's reasons for establishing the rate;

I13(B) sets forth the data, economic analyses, and other information relied on by the Postal Service to justify the rate; and

I13(C) certifies that the discount will not adversely affect rates or services provided to users of postal services who do not take advantage of the discount rate.

Q04

I11(f) T4Transition RuleK._For the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of this section, rates and classes for market-dominant products shall remain subject to modification in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and section 407, as such provisions were last in effect before the date of enactment of this section. Proceedings initiated to consider a request for a recommended decision filed by the Postal Service during that 1-year period shall be completed in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 36 of this title and implementing regulations, as in effect before the date of enactment of this section.

I12(1) T4In general._

I13(A) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Postal Service may contract for the transportation of mail by aircraft between any of the points in foreign air transportation only with certificated air carriers. A contract may be awarded to a certificated air carrier to transport mail by air between any of the points in foreign air transportation that the Secretary of Transportation has authorized the carrier to serve either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers.

I13(B) If the Postal Service has sought offers or proposals from certificated air carriers to transport mail in foreign air transportation between points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, and has not received offers or proposals that meet Postal Service requirements at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 such carriers, the Postal Service may seek offers or proposals from foreign air carriers. Where service in foreign air transportation meeting the Postal Service's requirements is unavailable at a fair and reasonable price from at least 2 certificated air carriers, either directly or through a code-share relationship with one or more foreign air carriers, the Postal Service may contract with foreign air carriers to provide the service sought if, when the Postal Service seeks offers or proposals from foreign air carriers, it also seeks an offer or proposal to provide that service from any certificated air carrier providing service between those points, or pairs of points within a geographic region or regions, on the same terms and conditions that are being sought from foreign air carriers.

I13(C) For purposes of this subsection, the Postal Service shall use a methodology for determining fair and reasonable prices for the Postal Service designated region or regions developed in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest.

I13(D) For purposes of this subsection, ceiling prices determined pursuant to the methodology used under subparagraph (C) shall be presumed to be fair and reasonable if they do not exceed the ceiling prices derived from_

I14(i) a weighted average based on market rate data furnished by the International Air Transport Association or a subsidiary unit thereof; or

I14(ii) if such data are not available from those sources, such other neutral, regularly updated set of weighted average market rates as the Postal Service, with the concurrence of certificated air carriers representing at least 51 percent of available ton miles in the markets of interest, may designate.

Q04

I13(E) If, for purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), concurrence cannot be attained, then the most recently available market rate data described in this subparagraph shall continue to apply for the relevant market or markets.

Q04

I12(2) T4Contract processK._The Postal Service shall contract for foreign air transportation as set forth in paragraph (1) through an open procurement process that will provide_

I13(B) requirements, proposed terms and conditions, and evaluation criteria to potential offerors; and

I13(C) an opportunity for unsuccessful offerors to receive prompt feedback upon request.

Q04

I12(3) T4Emergency or unanticipated conditions; inadequate lift spaceK._The Postal Service may enter into contracts to transport mail by air in foreign air transportation with a certificated air carrier or a foreign air carrier without complying with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) if_

I13(A) emergency or unanticipated conditions exist that make it impractical for the Postal Service to comply with such requirements; or

I13(B) its demand for lift exceeds the space available to it under existing contracts and_

I14(i) there is insufficient time available to seek additional lift using procedures that comply with those requirements without compromising the Postal Service's service commitments to its own customers; and

I14(ii) the Postal Service first offers any certificated air carrier holding a contract to carry mail between the relevant points the opportunity to carry such excess volumes under the terms of its existing contract.

Q04

I11(c) T4Good Faith Effort RequiredK._The Postal Service and potential offerors shall put a good-faith effort into resolving disputes concerning the award of contracts made under subsection (b).

I11(d) If the Postal Service determines that service by certificated air carriers or combination of air carriers between any pair or pairs of points in foreign air transportation is not adequate for its purposes, it may contract, without advertising for bids, in such manner and under such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, with any air taxi operator or combination thereof for such air transportation service. Contracts made under this subsection may be renewed at the existing rate by mutual agreement between the holder and the Postal Service. The Postal Service, with the consent of the air taxi operator, may adjust the compensation under such contracts for increased or decreased costs occasioned by changed conditions occurring during the contract term. The Postal Service shall cancel such a contract when the Secretary authorizes an additional certificated carrier or carriers to provide service between any pair or pairs of points covered by the contract, and such carrier or carriers inaugurate schedules adequate for its purposes.

I11(e)(1) The Postal Service may determine rates and contract with any air carrier for the transportation of mail by aircraft in interstate air transportation either through negotiations or competitive bidding.

I11(2)(A) In the exercise of its authority under paragraph (1), the Postal Service may require any air carrier to accept as mail shipments of day-old poultry, honeybees, and such other live animals as postal regulations allow to be transmitted as mail matter. The authority of the Postal Service under this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of any air carrier who commonly and regularly refuses to accept any live animals as cargo.

I11(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Postal Service is authorized to assess, as postage to be paid by the mailers of any shipments covered by subparagraph (A), a reasonable surcharge that the Postal Service determines in its discretion to be adequate to compensate air carriers for any necessary additional expense incurred in handling such shipments.

I11(f) The authority of the Secretary and the Postal Service under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall also apply, and the authority of the Postal Service under subsection (e) shall not apply, to the transportation of mail by aircraft between any two points both of which are within the State of Alaska and between which the air carrier is authorized by the Secretary to engage in the transportation of mail.

I11(g)(1)(A) The Postal Service, in selecting carriers of nonpriority bypass mail to any point served by more than 1 carrier in the State of Alaska, shall adhere to an equitable tender policy within a qualified group of carriers, in accordance with the regulations of the Postal Service, and shall, at a minimum, require that any such carrier_

I12(i) hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under section 41102(a) of title 49;

I12(ii) operate at least to such point at least the number of scheduled flights each week established under subparagraph (B)(i);

I12(iii) exhibit an adherence to such scheduled flights; and

I12(iv) have provided scheduled service with at least the number of scheduled noncontract flights each week established under subparagraph (B)(ii) between 2 points within the State of Alaska for at least 12 consecutive months with aircraft_

I13(I) up to 7,500 pounds payload capacity before being selected as a carrier of nonpriority bypass mail at an applicable intra-Alaska bush service mail rate; and

I13(II) the service to be provided on such route by the bush carrier is not otherwise available through direct mainline service; and

I13(III) tender of mail to such bush carrier will not decrease the efficiency of nonpriority bypass mail service (in terms of payments to all carriers providing service on the city pair route and timely delivery) for the route;

Q04

I12(F) may offer tender of nonpriority bypass mail to a passenger carrier from an acceptance point to a destination city beyond a hub point in the State of Alaska at a composite rate if the Postal Service determines that_

I13(i) the carrier provides passenger service in accordance with the requirements of subsection (h)(2);

I13(ii) the carrier qualifies under subsection (h) to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail out of the hub point being bypassed;

I13(iii) the tender of such mail will not decrease efficiency of delivery of nonpriority bypass mail service into or out of the hub point being bypassed; and

I13(iv) such tender will result in reduced payments to the carrier by the Postal Service over flying the entire route; and

Q04

I12(G) notwithstanding subparagraph (F), shall offer equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail in proportion to passenger and nonmail freight mail pools described in this section between qualified passenger and nonmail freight carriers on a route from an acceptance point to a bush destination in the State of Alaska at a composite rate if_

I13(i)(I) for a passenger carrier, the carrier receiving the composite rate provided 20 percent of the passenger service on the city pair route for the 12 months immediately preceding the date on which the carrier seeks tender of such mail; or

Q04

I11(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B), a carrier may designate only one hub city as its main hub and once such designation is transmitted to the Postal Service it may not be changed. Such selection and transmission must be transmitted to the Postal Service within 6 months of the date of enactment of the Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002. A carrier attempting to receive tender of nonpriority bypass mail under this subsection shall not be eligible for such tender after the carrier becomes qualified for tender of nonpriority bypass mail under subsection (h) or (i) on any route. The purchase of another carrier's hanger facility after such date of enactment shall not be considered sufficient to meet the requirement of subparagraph (B)(iv).

I11(k)(1) At least once every 2 years, in conjunction with annual updates, the Secretary shall review the need for a bush mail rate investigation.

Q04

I11(3) Documentation under paragraph (2) shall be retained for 7 years or until the Secretary indicates that the records may be destroyed. Copies of flight logs for aircraft sold or disposed of shall be retained.

I11(4) Carriers qualified to be tendered nonpriority bypass mail shall submit to the Secretary the number and type of aircraft in the carrier's fleet, the level of passenger insurance covering its fleet, and the name of the insurance company providing such coverage.

I11(T3lK) No qualified carrier may be tendered nonpriority bypass mail under subsections (h) and (i) simultaneously on a route unless no other carrier is tendered mail under either subsection.

I11(m)(1) Carriers qualifying for tender of nonpriority bypass mail under subsections (h) and (i) simultaneously shall be tendered such mail under subsection (h).

I11(2) A carrier shall be tendered nonpriority bypass mail under subsection (i) if that carrier_

I12(A) was qualified under both subsections (h) and (i) simultaneously; and

I12(B) becomes unqualified under subsection (h) but remains qualified under subsection (i).

Q04

I11(n)(1) A carrier operation resulting from a merger or acquisition between any 2 carriers operating between points in the State of Alaska shall have the passenger and nonmail freight of all such merged or acquired carriers on the applicable route counted toward meeting the resulting carrier's minimum requirements to receive equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail on such route for the 12-month period following the date of the merger or acquisition.

I11(2) After the 12-month period described under paragraph (1), the carrier resulting from the merger or acquisition shall demonstrate that the carrier meets the minimum passenger or nonmail freight carriage requirements of this section to continue receiving tender of such mail.

I11(T3oK) In addition to any penalties applied to a carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration or the Secretary, any carrier that significantly misstates passenger or nonmail freight data required to be reported under this section on any route, in an attempt to qualify for tender of nonpriority bypass mail, shall receive_

I12(1) a 1-month suspension of tender of nonpriority bypass mail on the route where the data was misstated for the first offense;

I12(2) a 6-month suspension of tender of nonpriority bypass mail on the route where the data was misstated for the second offense;

I12(3) a 1-year suspension of tender of all nonpriority bypass mail in the entire State of Alaska for the third offense in the State; and

I12(4) a permanent suspension of tender of all nonpriority bypass mail in the entire State of Alaska for the fourth offense in the State.

Q04

I11(p)(1) The Postal Service or the Secretary, in carrying out subsection (g)(2), (h), or (i), may deny equitable tender to an otherwise qualified carrier that does not operate under this section in good faith or under the intent of this section.

I11(2) The Postal Service or the Secretary may waive any provision of subsection (h) or (i), if the carrier provides substantial passenger or nonmail freight service on the route in the State of Alaska where the carrier seeks tender of nonpriority mail and nonpriority bypass mail.

I11(3) To ensure adequate competition among passenger carriers on a mainline route in the State of Alaska the Postal Service or the Secretary may waive the requirements of subsection (g)(1)(A)(iv), (g)(2)(E), (g)(4), or (g)(5), or any provision of subsection (h) if a 121 bush passenger carrier seeks tender of nonpriority bypass mail on a mainline route in the State of Alaska not served by a 121 mainline passenger carrier and the 121 bush passenger carrier provides substantial passenger service on the route. Waivers provided for under this paragraph shall be granted only in extreme cases of lack of competition and only to extent that are absolutely necessary to meet the minimum needs of the community. Waivers granted under this subsection shall cease to be valid once a qualified mainline passenger carrier begins providing service and seeks tender of nonpriority bypass mail in accordance with this section on the city pair route. The receipt of waivers and subsequent operation of service on a city pair route under this subsection shall not be counted towards meeting the requirements of any part of this section for any other city pair route.

I11(4) In granting waivers for or denying tender to carriers under this subsection, the Postal Service or the Secretary shall consider in the following order of importance_

I12(A) the passenger needs of the destination to be served (including amount and level);

I12(B) the nonmail freight needs of the destination to be served;

I12(C) the amount of nonpriority bypass mail service already available to the destination;

I12(D) the mail needs of the destination to be served;

I12(E) the savings to the Postal Service in terms of payments made to carriers;

I12(F) the amount or level of passenger service already available to the destination; and

I12(G) the amount of nonmail freight service already available to the destination.

Q04

I11(q) The Secretary shall make a regular review of carriers receiving, or attempting to qualify to receive, equitable tender of nonpriority bypass mail on a city pair route in the State of Alaska. If the Secretary suspends or revokes an operating certificate, the Secretary shall notify the Postal Service. Upon such notification, the Postal Service shall cease tender of mail to such carrier until the Secretary certifies the carrier is operating in a safe manner. Upon such receipt, the carrier shall demonstrate that it otherwise meets the minimum carriage requirements of this section before being tendered mail under this section.

I11(r) The Postal Service shall have the authority to tender nonpriority bypass mail to any carrier that meets the requirements of subsection (g)(1) on any city pair route in the State of Alaska on an emergency basis. Such emergency tender shall cease when a carrier qualifies for tender on such route under the terms of this section.

I11(s) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except for written contracts authorized under subsections (b), (c) and (d), tender by the Postal Service of any category of mail to a carrier for transportation between any two points in the State of Alaska shall not give rise to any contract between the Postal Service and a carrier, nor shall any such carrier acquire any right in continued or future tender of such mail by virtue of past or present receipt of such mail. This subsection shall apply to any case commenced before, on, or after the date of enactment of this subsection.

I74Findings

I21Pub. L. 107ÿ09206, title III, ÿ1A3002(b), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 910, provided that: ``Congress makes the following findings:

I22``(1) The State of Alaska is the largest State in the Union and has a very limited system of roads connecting communities.

I22``(2) Alaska has more pilots per capita than any other State in the Union.

I22``(3) Pilots flying in Alaska are often the most skilled and best-prepared pilots in the world.

I22``(4) Air travel within the State of Alaska is often hampered by severe weather conditions and treacherous terrain.

I22``(5) The United States Government owns nearly \2/3\ of Alaska's landmass, including large tracts of land separating isolated communities within the State.

I22``(6) Such Federal ownership has inhibited the ability of Alaskans to build roads connecting isolated communities.

I22``(7) Most communities and a large portion of the population within the State can only be reached by air.

I22``(8) The vast majority of food items and everyday necessities destined for these isolated communities and populations can only be transported through the air.

I22``(9) The Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system, created by Congress and operated by the United States Postal Service under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code, with input from the Department of Transportation, connecting hundreds of rural and isolated communities within the State, is a critical piece of the Alaska and the national transportation system. The system is like a 4-legged stool, designed to_

I23``(A) provide the most affordable means of delivering food and everyday necessities to these rural and isolated communities;

I23``(B) establish a system whereby the Postal Service can meet its obligations to deliver mail to every house and business in the United States;

I23``(C) support affordable and reliable passenger service; and

I23``(D) support affordable and reliable nonmail freight service.

I22``(10) Without the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system_

I23``(A) it would be difficult and more expensive for the Postal Service to meet its obligation of delivering mail to every house and business in the United States; and

I23``(B) food, medicine, freight, and everyday necessities and passenger service for these rural and isolated communities would cost several times the current level.

I22``(11) Attempts by Congress to support passenger and nonmail freight service in Alaska using the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system have yielded some positive results, but some carriers have been manipulating the system by carrying few, if any, passengers and little nonmail freight while earning most of their revenues from the carriage of nonpriority bypass mail.

I22``(12) As long as the Federal Government continues to own large tracts of land within the State of Alaska which impede access to isolated communities, it is in the best interest of the Postal Service, the residents of Alaska and the United States_

I23``(A) to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system remains strong, viable, and affordable for the Postal Service;

I23``(B) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe passenger service;

I23``(C) to ensure that residents of rural and isolated communities in Alaska continue to have affordable, reliable, and safe nonmail freight service;

I23``(D) to encourage that intra-Alaska air carriers move toward safer, more secure, and more reliable air transportation under the Federal Aviation Administration's guidelines and in accordance with part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, where such operations are supported by the needs of the community; and

I23``(E) that Congress, pursuant to the authority granted under Article I, section 8 of the United States Constitution to establish Post Offices and post roads, make changes to ensure that the Intra-Alaska Bypass Mail system continues to be used to support substantial passenger and nonmail freight service and to reduce costs for the Postal Service.''

I21Pub. L. 107ÿ09206, title III, ÿ1A3002(d), Aug. 2, 2002, 116 Stat. 923, provided that: ``Beginning 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 2, 2002], if the Secretary determines, based on the Secretary's findings and recommendations of the Postal Service, that an air carrier being tendered nonpriority bush bypass mail is not taking actions to attempt to qualify as a bush passenger or nonmail freight carrier under section 5402 of title 39, United States Code (as amended by this title), the Postal Service shall immediately cease tender of all nonpriority bypass mail to such carrier.''
