I21The definitions in clauses (1) and (2), (6)ÿ09(10), (14)ÿ09(21), and (24) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this revised title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used, and so far as possible are identical to those used in title 10, United States Code, containing most of the basic law relating to the armed forces.

I21In clause (3), the words ``and all Regular and Reserve components thereof'', in section 231(a) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage. Section 231(j) of existing title 37 is omitted as covered by section 1 of title 1.

I21In clause (4), that part of section 32(a) of existing title 37 relating other than to the enumeration of the armed forces is omitted as unnecessary. Section 231(k) of existing title 37 is omitted, since throughout the revised title references to members of the Army or Air Force without specification of component are specifically included when necessary.

I21In clause (11), the words ``flight officer'' are omitted as obsolete. Section 231(c) (last sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted as unnecessary.

I21In clause (12), the definition of commissioned officer is broadened and restated to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of title 10. Corresponding changes are made throughout the revised title to correspond to the definition.

I21Clause (13), which is identical to section 101(16) of title 10, is substituted for section 231(e) of existing title 37. The words ``flight officer'' are omitted as obsolete. Section 231(h) of existing title 37 is omitted, since the defined term is not used in the revised title.

I21Clause (22) is substituted for section 231(i) of existing title 37.

I21In clause (23), section 231(b) (less 1st sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted as executed by the express coverage of members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.

(24), was executed by making the substitution in pars. (1) to (23) and by striking ``and'' at end of par. (23), to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because par.

e

I21In subsection (a), the words ``whether under temporary or permanent appointment'' are omitted as surplusage. The words ``the following pay grades'' are substituted for the words ``the various pay grades prescribed for commissioned officers by subsection (a) of this section, as follows''. The words ``(other than a commissioned warrant officer)'' are inserted to conform to the definition of ``warrant officer'' in section 101(13) of this revised title.

I21In subsection (b), the words ``with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title'' are substituted for the word ``minimum''.

I21In subsections (c) and (e), the words ``with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title'' are substituted for the words ``with under two cumulative years' service'' and ``with under two cumulative years of service'', in sections 308 and 232(e), respectively, of existing title 37.

I21In subsection (e), the words ``enlisted or appointed under the Army Aviation Cadet Act, as amended, or under the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942, as amended'' are omitted as obsolete and surplusage. Both of the cited acts were repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and replaced by various sections of title 10. Further reference is surplusage, however, since aviation cadets are not appointed or enlisted under any provision of law other than the sections of title 10 embodying the former Army Aviation Cadet Act and the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942. The word ``basic'' is inserted for clarity, since the word ``pay'' as defined in section 101(21) of this revised title includes special and incentive pays. Incentive pay for aviation cadets is provided in section 301(b) of this revised title.

I21In subsection (f), the words ``While on active duty'', in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14, are omitted as covered by section 204 of this title which prescribes the conditions under which members of the uniformed services are entitled to basic pay. The words ``Unless he is entitled to the basic pay of a higher pay grade'' are substituted for the words ``or that of his grade, whichever is greater'' in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14.

I21In subsection (g), the words ``Except as provided by subsections (e) and (f)'' are inserted to reflect those subsections relating to enlisted aviation cadets or aviation pilots.

I21[The citations to section 232(d) of existing title 37, above, are to the language of subsection (d) set forth in the codification note under section 232, rather than that erroneously set forth in the text of the section.]

I21In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for the words ``or performance of the duties provided for by sections 5, 81, 94, 97 and 99 of the National Defense Act, as amended,'' to reflect the current citations. So much of the introductory clause as follows the exception is substituted for the 36 words preceding 1st proviso of 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37. The words ``on the active list'' are omitted as covered by the words ``active duty'' as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title. The words ``(provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, or in the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended)'' are omitted as covered by the words ``provided by law''.

I21In subsection (b), the words ``For the purposes of subsection (a)'' are inserted for clarity. The words ``active duty for a period of more than 30 days'' are substituted for the words ``extended active duty in excess of thirty days''. The words ``call or'' are inserted to conform to the words ``called or''.

I21In subsection (c), the words ``and allowances'' are omitted, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances depends upon entitlement to basic pay. The last sentence is substituted for the last 38 words of the 2d proviso of the 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37.

I21In subsection (d), the words ``for the purposes of this section'' are substituted for the words ``and which entitles them to receive basic pay . . . in the service of the United States''. The words ``pursuant to this section'' are omitted as surplusage.

I21In subsection (e), the words ``or active duty for training'' are omitted as covered by the words ``active duty'' as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.

I21In subsection (f), the words ``is appointed'' are substituted for the words ``has been or may be commissioned''. The words ``under the laws appointing such graduates to the Army'' and the last 16 words of section 308a of existing title 37 are omitted as surplusage. The words ``to the date of his acceptance of and qualification under his commission'' are omitted, since the member concerned would continue to be entitled to basic pay after that acceptance and qualification. The words ``or the United States Naval Academy'' are inserted to reflect section 541 of title 10, under which graduates of that Academy may be appointed in the Army or the Air Force.

I21In subsection (i), the inclusion of the Coast Guard Reserve is based on the authority contained in section 755(c) of title 14.

I21In subsection (a), the introductory clause is substituted for section 233(a) (introductory clause) of existing title 37. In clauses (1) and (2), the word ``officer'' is substituted for the words ``commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, warrant officer'' to conform to the definition of ``officer'' in section 101(11) of this revised title. In clause (1), the words ``Regular or Reserve component'' are omitted, since, under the definition of ``reserve component'' in section 102(k) of the source statute, those words are defined to include members without component status. Together, these categories compose the entire structure of any uniformed service. In clause (2)(F), the words ``a reserve component of a uniformed service'' are substituted for the words ``the National Guard of the United States, or in the Organized Reserve Corps, or in the Officers' Reserve Corps, or in the Enlisted Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Navy, or in the Dental Reserve Corps of the Navy ... or in the Naval Reserve ... or in the Air National Guard of the United States, or in the Air Force Reserve, or in the officers' section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the enlisted section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the Air Corps Reserve ... or in the Marine Corps Reserve, or in the Coast Guard Reserve, or in the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,'' since all of the named organizations were or are reserve components. In clause (4), the words ``as it existed at any time before April 16, 1947'' are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before April 16, 1947. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy. In clause (6), the date ``January 1, 1961,'' is substituted for the words ``the effective date of this section,'' to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes. See, for example, Public Law 86ÿ09142. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37. The last sentence is substituted for section 233(b) (proviso) of existing title 37.

I21In subsection (b), the first 33 words of section 233(d) of existing title 37 are omitted as covered by the words ``are computed by adding'' in subsection (a). The words ``for any reason,'' in section 233(d) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage.

I21In subsection (c)(3), the words ``chapter 67 of title 10'' are substituted for the words ``title III of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948,'' since that title was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and is now codified as chapter 67 of title 10 by section 1 of that Act.

I11(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the years of service of a member as an air weapons controller shall be computed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, from the date the member begins training leading to a designation as an air weapons controller, but there shall be excluded from such computation any period of more than 90 days during which the member performs primary duties other than as an air weapons controller.

I11(d)(1) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of incentive pay for any hazardous duty described in subsection (a).

I11(2) A member is entitled to not more than two payments of incentive pay, authorized by this section, for a period of time during which he qualifies for more than one payment of that pay.

I11(e) A member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay may be paid incentive pay under this subsection, at a monthly rate not to exceed $150, for any month during which the member performs duty involving regular participation as a firefighting crew member, as determined by the Secretary concerned.

He is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty, or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title.

If the sum of units determined under the preceding sentence equals or exceeds the minimum standard prescribed by the President for entitlement to pay specified under subsections (b) and (c) for a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire relevant month, the member shall be entitled to an increase in compensation equal to 1/30 of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) or (c) for the performance of that hazardous duty by a member of corresponding grade who is entitled to basic pay for the entire month.

I11(B) A member who qualifies for entitlement under this paragraph is entitled to the increase for each day in the relevant month in which he is entitled to basic pay pursuant to section 204 of this title or to compensation under section 206 of this title.

I11(C) In this paragraph, the term ``units'' means the significant increments of performance prescribed as qualifying standards in regulations promulgated by the President pursuant to this section.

I21In subsection (a), the words ``is also entitled'' are substituted for the words ``shall, in addition thereto, be entitled''. The words ``For the purposes of this subsection'' are inserted for clarity. The word ``competent'' is omitted as surplusage.

I21In subsection (b), the words preceding the tables are substituted for section 235(b) (words preceding tables) of existing title 37. The words ``Years of service computed under section 205'' are inserted in the tables for clarity.

I21In subsection (f), the words ``a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard'' are substituted for the enumeration of the organizations concerned in section 301(d) of existing title 37. The words ``when ... performs, under orders, any duty described in subsection (a)(1)ÿ09(11) for members entitled to basic pay'' are substituted for the words ``when required by competent orders to perform any hazardous duty prescribed by or pursuant to section 235 of this title for members of the uniformed services entitled to receive basic pay and when in consequence of such orders they do perform any hazardous duty so prescribed''. The last sentence is substituted for section 301(e) (as applicable to (d)) of existing title 37.

I21In subsection (g), the words ``entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a)(1) of this title'' are substituted for the words ``flight pay''. At the time of the enactment of the source statute, additional pay was authorized as ``flight pay''. However, the Career Compensation Act of 1949 did not authorize ``flight pay'' but provided incentive pay in section 204(a)(1) [now section 301(a)(1) of this revised title] for ``duty as a crew member ... involving frequent and regular participation in aerial flight''. The words ``before January 2 of each year'' are substituted for the words ``On or before January 1, annually''. The word ``grade'' is substituted for the word ``rank'' to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of this revised title.

I11(3) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, or the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to members under their respective jurisdiction, an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay in the amount set forth in subsection (b) that is applicable to him. A flight surgeon or other medical officer who is entitled to basic pay, holds an aeronautical rating or designation, and is qualified for aviation service under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, is not entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay but is entitled to monthly incentive pay in the amounts set forth in subsection (b) for the frequent and regular performance of operational flying duty.

I11(4) To be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay, an officer must perform the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for 8 of the first 12, and 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer. However, if an officer performs the prescribed operational flying duties (including flight training but excluding proficiency flying) for at least 10 but less than 12 of the first 18 years of the aviation service of the officer, the officer will be entitled to continuous monthly incentive pay for the first 22 years of aviation service of the officer. Entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases for an officer (other than a warrant officer) upon completion of 25 years of aviation service, but such an officer in a pay grade below pay grade Oÿ097 remains entitled to monthly incentive pay under subsection (b)(1) for the performance of operational flying duty.

I11(5) If upon completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service it is determined that an officer has failed to perform the minimum prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time, his entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases. For the needs of the service, the Secretary concerned may permit, on a case by case basis, an officer to continue to receive continuous monthly incentive pay despite the failure of the officer to perform the prescribed operational flying duty requirements during the prescribed periods of time so long as the officer has performed those requirements for not less than 6 years of aviation service. The Secretary concerned may not delegate the authority in the preceding sentence to permit the payment of incentive pay under this subsection. If at the completion of 12 years of aviation service entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases, entitlement to that pay may again commence at the completion of 18 years of aviation service upon completion of the minimum operational flying duty requirements, such pay to continue for a period of time as prescribed in accordance with this section. However, if entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay ceases in the case of any officer at the completion of either 12 or 18 years of aviation service, such officer remains entitled to monthly incentive pay for the performance of subsequent operational or proficiency flying duties up to the maximum period of time prescribed in accordance with this section.

I11(6) In this section:

I12(A) The term ``aviation service'' means service performed by an officer (except a flight surgeon or other medical officer) while holding an aeronautical rating or designation or while in training to receive an aeronautical rating or designation.

I12(B) The term ``operational flying duty'' means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying skills normally are maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of an aeronautical rating or designation.

I12(C) The term ``proficiency flying duty'' means flying performed under competent orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which such skills would normally not be maintained in the performance of assigned duties.

I11(4) An officer serving as an air battle manager who is entitled to aviation career incentive pay under this section and who, before becoming entitled to aviation career incentive pay, was entitled to incentive pay under section 301(a)(13) of this title, shall be paid the monthly incentive pay at the higher of the following rates:

I12(A) The rate otherwise applicable to the member under this subsection.

I12(B) The rate at which the member was receiving incentive pay under section 301(c)(2)(A) of this title immediately before the member's entitlement to aviation career incentive pay under this section.

I11(c) In time of war, the President may suspend the payment of aviation career incentive pay.

I11(d) Under regulations prescribed by the President and to the extent provided for by appropriations, when a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service, or of the National Guard, who is entitled to compensation under section 206 of this title, performs, under orders, duty described in subsection (a) for members entitled to basic pay, he is entitled to an increase in compensation equal to \1/30\ of the monthly incentive pay authorized by subsection (b) for the performance of that duty by a member with corresponding years of aviation service who is entitled to basic pay. Such member is entitled to the increase for as long as he is qualified for it, for each regular period of instruction, or period of appropriate duty, at which he is engaged for at least two hours, including that performed on a Sunday or holiday, or for the performance of such other equivalent training, instruction, duty or appropriate duties, as the Secretary may prescribe under section 206(a) of this title. This subsection does not apply to a member who is entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title.

The basic allowance for housing may be paid in advance.

I11(2) A member of a uniformed service with dependents is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing as a member with dependents unless the member makes a certification to the Secretary concerned indicating the status of each dependent of the member.

I11(5) On and after July 1, 2001, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a single monthly rate for members of the uniformed services with dependents in pay grades Eÿ091 through Eÿ094 in the same military housing area.

I11(6) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member.

I11(7)(A) Under the authority of this paragraph, the Secretary of Defense may prescribe a temporary increase in the rates of basic allowance for housing otherwise prescribed for a military housing area or a portion of a military housing area if the military housing area or portion thereof_

Q04

I11(2) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing in an overseas area and the actual monthly cost of housing for the member is not reduced, the monthly amount of the allowance in an area outside the United States may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member. The monthly amount of the allowance may be adjusted to reflect changes in currency rates.

I11(3)(A) In the case of a member of the uniformed services authorized to receive an allowance under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may make a lump-sum payment to the member for required deposits and advance rent, and for expenses relating thereto, that are_

I21In subsection (a), the words ``Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section,'' are inserted for clarity. The words ``of an armed force'' are inserted, since the source section, as originally enacted, did not apply to the Public Health Service or the Coast and Geodetic Survey. (See section 243 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 492).) The words ``of the Army, or the Air Force, without specification of component'' are inserted to reflect the definition of ``reserve component'' in section 102(k) of the source statute. That definition is executed throughout this revised title. For that reason, the words ``but not as a member of the Army without specification of component or the Air Force without specification of component, in section 255(a)(2) of existing title 37'', are omitted, and since those categories are excluded by the words ``member of a reserve component''. The words ``of a reserve component'', in section 255(a)(3) of existing title 37, are omitted, since the Ready Reserve cannot be in anything other than a reserve component.

I21In subsection (b), the words ``heretofore or hereafter'' are omitted as surplusage.

I21In subsection (c), the words ``An officer'' are substituted for the words ``any individual'', since the revised section applies only to officers.

I21In subsection (d), the words ``who is in pay grade Oÿ091, Oÿ092, or Oÿ093'' are substituted for the words ``is receiving the pay of the junior assistant, assistant, or senior assistant grade'' to reflect current terminology. (See chapter 3 of this revised title.) The last sentence is substituted for section 214 (words following semicolon) of title 14.

I21In subsection (e), the words ``as a temporary officer'' are inserted for clarity. The words ``5596 or'' are substituted for section 302(f) of the Act of August 7, 1947, cited above.

I11(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a member of a uniformed service who is ordered to make a change of permanent station is entitled to transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place of the cost of transportation, plus a per diem, for the member's dependents at rates prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, but not more than the rate authorized under section 474(d) of this title. The Secretary concerned may also reimburse the member for mandatory pet quarantine fees for household pets, but not to exceed $550 per change of station, when the member incurs the fees incident to such change of station.

I11(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a member who_

I12(i) is separated from the service or released from active duty; and

I12(ii) on the date of his separation from the service or release from active duty, has not served on active duty for a period of time equal to at least 90 percent of the period of time for which he initially enlisted or otherwise initially agreed to serve,

Q04

I10may be provided transportation under this subsection for his dependents only by transportation in kind by the least expensive mode of transportation available or by a monetary allowance that does not exceed the cost to the Government of such transportation in kind.

I11(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a member_

I12(i) who is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;

I12(ii) who is separated from the service or released from active duty for a medical condition affecting the member, as determined by the Secretary concerned;

Temporary storage in excess of 180 days may be authorized. Alternatively, the member may be paid reimbursement or a monetary allowance under subparagraph (F).

I11(B) Subject to uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, in the case of a permanent change of station in which the Secretary concerned has authorized transportation of a motor vehicle under section 2634 of title 10 (except when such transportation is authorized from the old duty station to the new duty station), the member is entitled to a monetary allowance for transportation of that motor vehicle_

I12(i) from the old duty station to_

I13(I) the customary port of embarkation which is nearest the old duty station if delivery of the motor vehicle to the port of embarkation is not made in conjunction with the member's travel to the member's port of embarkation; or

I13(II) the customary port of embarkation which is nearest to the member's port of embarkation if delivery of the motor vehicle to the port of embarkation is made in conjunction with the member's travel to the member's port of embarkation;

Q04

I17whichever is most cost-effective for the Government considering all operational, travel, and transportation requirements incident to such change of station; and

I12(ii) from the customary port of debarkation which has been designated by the Government as most cost-effective for the Government considering all operational, travel, and transportation requirements incident to such change of station to the new duty station.

Q04

I11(D)(i) In connection with the change of temporary or permanent station of a member in a pay grade below pay grade Oÿ096, the Secretary concerned may authorize a higher weight allowance than the weight allowance determined under subparagraph (C) for the member if the Secretary concerned determines that the application of the weight allowance determined under such subparagraph would result in significant hardship to the member or the dependents of the member. An increase in weight allowance under this clause may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allowance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades Oÿ096 to Oÿ0910, unless the additional weight allowance in excess of such maximum is intended to permit the shipping of consumables that cannot be reasonably obtained at the new station of the member.

I11(ii) In addition to the weight allowance authorized for such member with dependents under paragraph (C), the Secretary concerned may authorize up to an additional 500 pounds in weight allowance for shipment of professional books and equipment belonging to the spouse of such member.

I11(iii) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subparagraph.

I11(E) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Homeland Security for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy, and midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy shall be entitled, in connection with temporary or permanent station change, to transportation of baggage and household effects as provided in subparagraph (A). The weight allowance for cadets and midshipmen is 350 pounds.

I11(F) A member entitled to transportation of baggage and household effects under subparagraph (A) may, as an alternative to the provision of transportation, be paid reimbursement or, at the member's request, a monetary allowance in advance for the cost of transportation of the baggage and household effects. The monetary allowance may be paid only if the amount of the allowance does not exceed the cost that would be incurred by the Government under subparagraph (A) for the transportation of the baggage and household effects. Appropriations available to the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services for providing transportation of baggage or household effects of members of the uniformed services shall be available to pay a reimbursement or monetary allowance under this subparagraph. The Secretary concerned may prescribe the manner in which the risk of liability for damage, destruction, or loss of baggage or household effects arranged, packed, crated, or loaded by a member is allocated among the member, the United States, and any contractor when a reimbursement or monetary allowance is elected under this subparagraph.

I11(G) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary concerned may pay a member a share (determined pursuant to such regulations) of the savings resulting to the United States when the total weights of the member's baggage and household effects shipped and stored under subparagraph (A) are less than the average weights of the baggage and household effects that are shipped and stored, respectively, by other members in the same grade and with the same dependents status as the member in connection with changes of station that are comparable to the member's change of station. The total savings shall be equal to the difference between the cost of shipping and cost of storing such average weights of baggage and household effects, respectively, and the corresponding costs associated with the weights of the member's baggage and household effects. For the administration of this subparagraph, the Secretary of Defense shall annually determine the average weights of baggage and household effects shipped and stored in connection with a change of temporary or permanent station.

I11(H)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subject to clause (iii), in connection with an evacuation from a permanent station located in a foreign area, a member is entitled to transportation (including shipment and payment of any quarantine costs) of family household pets.

I11(ii) A member entitled to transportation under clause (i) may be paid reimbursement or, at the member's request, a monetary allowance in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (F) if the member secures by commercial means shipment and any quarantining of the pets otherwise subject to transportation under clause (i).

I11(iii) The provision of transportation under clause (i) and the payment of reimbursement under clause (ii) shall be subject to such regulations as the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe with respect to members of the armed forces for purposes of this subparagraph. Such regulations may specify limitations on the types, size, and number of pets for which transportation may be provided or reimbursement paid.

I11(2) The transportation and allowances authorized under paragraph (1) may be paid or provided to a member upon his separation from the service or release from active duty only if the member applies for the transportation and allowances not later than 180 days after the date of his separation or release from active duty. If a member to whom this paragraph applies has been authorized nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the 180-day period shall not begin until such authorization for nontemporary storage expires. This paragraph does not apply to a member to whom subsection (g)(1) applies.

I11(c) The allowances and transportation authorized by subsections (a) and (b) are in addition to those authorized by sections 403(c), 474, and 475 of this title and are_

I12(1) subject to such conditions and limitations;

I12(2) for such grades, ranks, and ratings; and

I12(3) to and from such places;

Q04

I10prescribed by the Secretaries concerned. Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs. However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.

I11(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States. However, the weight of baggage and household effects stored, plus the weight of the baggage and household effects transported, in connection with a change of station may not be more than the maximum weight limitations in regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned when it is not otherwise fixed by law. In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate. The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who_

I12(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or

I12(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.

Q04

I10Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.

I11(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which_

I12(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;

I12(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or

I12(3) the member is serving on permanent duty at a station outside the United States, in Hawaii or Alaska, or on sea duty.

Q04

I11(f)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, transportation for dependents, baggage, and household effects of a member, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, is authorized if the member dies while entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.

I11(2) The Secretary concerned shall give the dependents of a member described in paragraph (1) a period of not less than three years, beginning on the date of the death of the member, during which to select a home for the purposes of the travel and transportation allowances authorized by this section.

I11(g)(1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member who_

I12(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;

I12(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or

I12(C) is involuntarily separated from active duty during the period beginning on October 1, 1990, and ending on December 31, 2001,

Q04

I10is, not later than one year from the date he is so retired, placed on that list, involuntarily separated, discharged, or released, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned, entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects to the home selected under section 474(c) of this title, and to a per diem for his dependents. In addition, baggage and household effects may be shipped to a location other than the home selected by the member.

I11(2) If baggage and household effects of a member are shipped to a place selected by a member as his home under section 474(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 474(c)(2) of this title or to a location other than the home selected by the member, or if transportation is provided for a member's dependents to a place selected by the member as his home under section 474(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 474(c)(2) of this title, and the costs of that shipment or transportation are in excess of those that would have been incurred if the shipment had been made or the transportation had been provided to a location in the United States (other than Alaska or Hawaii), the member shall pay that excess cost.

I11(3) If a member authorized to select a home under section 474(c) of this title accrues that right or any entitlement under this subsection but dies before the member exercises the right or entitlement, that right or entitlement accrues to and may be exercised by the surviving dependents at any time before the end of the three-year period beginning on the date on which the member accrued that right or entitlement. If there are no surviving dependents, the baggage and household effects of the deceased member may be shipped to the home of the person legally entitled to such baggage and effects. However, if baggage and household effects are shipped under circumstances described in paragraph (2) in which the member would have been required to pay the excess costs of that shipment, the surviving dependents or the person legally entitled to the baggage and household effects, as the case may be, shall pay that excess cost.

I11(h)(1) If the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the best interests of a member described in paragraph (2) or the member's dependents and the United States, the Secretary may, when orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects_

I12(A) authorize the movement of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects at the station to an appropriate location in the United States or its possessions or, if the dependents are foreign nationals, to the country of the dependents' origin and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof, as the case may be, plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b); and

I12(B) in the case of a member described in paragraph (2)(A), authorize the transportation of one motor vehicle, which is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of a dependent of the member, to that location by means of transportation authorized under section 2634 of title 10 or authorize the storage of the motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.

Q04

I10If the member's baggage and household effects are in nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may authorize their movement to the location concerned and prescribe transportation in kind or reimbursement therefor, as authorized under subsection (b). For the purposes of this section, a member's unmarried child for whom the member received transportation in kind to his station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof and who, by reason of age or graduation from (or cessation of enrollment in) an institution of higher education, would otherwise cease to be a dependent of the member while the member was serving at that station shall still be considered as a dependent of the member.

I11(2) A member referred to in paragraph (1) is a member who_

I12(A) is serving at a station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska;

I12(B) receives an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions; or

I12(C) is sentenced by a court-martial_

I13(i) to be confined for a period of more than 30 days,

I13(ii) to receive a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or

I13(iii) to be dismissed from a uniformed service.

Q04

I11(3) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under this subsection does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first).

I11(4)(A) If a determination described in subparagraph (B) is made with respect to a dependent of a member described in that subparagraph and a request described in subparagraph (C) is made by or on behalf of that dependent, the Secretary may provide a benefit authorized for a member under paragraph (1) or (3) to that dependent in lieu of providing such benefit to the member.

I11(B) A determination described in this subparagraph is a determination by the commanding officer of a member that_

I12(i) the member has committed a dependent-abuse offense against a dependent of the member;

I12(ii) a safety plan and counseling have been provided to that dependent;

I12(iii) the safety of the dependent is at risk; and

I12(iv) the relocation of the dependent is advisable.

Q04

I11(C) A request described in this subparagraph is a request by the spouse of a member, or by the parent of a dependent child in the case of a dependent child of a member, for relocation.

I11(D) Transportation may be provided under this paragraph for household effects or a motor vehicle only if a written agreement of the member, or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, gives possession of the effects or vehicle to the spouse or dependent of the member concerned.

I11(E) In this paragraph, the term ``dependent-abuse offense'' means an offense described in section 1059(c) of title 10.

The cost of the storage and transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking) of household and personal effects shall be charged against appropriations currently available.

I11(g) The Secretary concerned may, when he determines that there is an emergency and a sale would be in the best interests of the United States, provide for the public or private sale of motor vehicles and other bulky items of household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b). Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of the interested persons. The net proceeds received from the sale shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sent to the owner or other persons.

I11(h) Claims for net proceeds that are covered into the Treasury under subsection (g) may be filed with the Secretary of Defense by the rightful owners, their heirs or next of kin, or their legal representatives at any time before the end of a 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury. When a claim is filed, the Secretary of Defense shall allow or disallow it. A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered. If a claim is not filed before the end of the 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the courts or the Secretary of Defense.

I11(i) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under this section does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the dependent for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first). In a case in which two motor vehicles of a member (or the dependent or dependents of a member) are transported at the expense of the United States, no reimbursement is payable under this subsection unless both motor vehicles do not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicles by the designated delivery date.

I89. Pay and allowances; continuance while in a missing status; limitations

I11(a) A member of a uniformed service who is on active duty or performing inactive-duty training, and who is in a missing status, is_

I12(1) for the period he is in that status, entitled to receive or have credited to his account the same pay and allowances, as defined in this chapter, to which he was entitled at the beginning of that period or may thereafter become entitled; and

I12(2) for the period, not to exceed one year, required for his hospitalization and rehabilitation after termination of that status, under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, with respect to incentive pay, considered to have satisfied the requirements of section 301 of this title so as to entitle him to a continuance of that pay.

Q04

I10However, a member who is performing full-time training duty or other full-time duty without pay, or inactive-duty training with or without pay, is entitled to the pay and allowances to which he would have been entitled if he had been on active duty with pay. Notwithstanding section 1523 of title 10 or any other provision of law, the promotion of a member while he is in a missing status is fully effective for all purposes.

I11(b) The expiration of a member's term of service while he is in a missing status does not end his entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a). Notwithstanding the death of a member while in a missing status, entitlement to pay and allowances under subsection (a) ends on the date_

I12(1) the Secretary concerned receives evidence that the member is dead; or

I12(2) that his death is prescribed or determined under section 555 of this title or under chapter 76 of title 10.

Q04

I12(3) the fact of dependency for the purpose of paying six months' death gratuities authorized by law;

I12(4) the fact of dependency under any other law authorizing the payment of pay, allowances, or other emoluments to enlisted members of the armed forces, when the payments are contingent on dependency;

I12(5) any other status covered by this chapter;

I12(6) an essential date, including one on which evidence or information is received by the Secretary concerned; and

I12(7) whether information received concerning a member of a uniformed service is to be construed and acted on as an official report of death.

Q04

I10Paragraphs (1), (5), (6), and (7) only apply with respect to a case to which section 555 of this title applies.

I11(b) When the Secretary concerned, in a case to which section 555 of this title applies, receives information that he considers establishes conclusively the death of a member of a uniformed service, he shall, notwithstanding any earlier action relating to death or other status of the member, act on it as an official report of death. After the end of the 12-month period in a missing status prescribed by section 555 of this title, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, shall, when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that a member in a missing status is dead, make a finding of death.

I11(c) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may determine the entitlement of a member to pay and allowances under this chapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that a member captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.

I11(d) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may, when warranted by the circumstances, reconsider a determination made under this chapter, and change or modify it.

I11(e) When the account of a member has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this chapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the member if the Secretary concerned, or his designee, determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the member was not a party.

I11(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from pay and allowances of a member for the period he is entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when it was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death. An allotment payment for a period after the end of entitlement to pay and allowances under this chapter, or otherwise, which was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death, may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of the deceased member.

I11(g) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may waive the recovery of an erroneous payment or overpayment of an allotment to a dependent if he considers recovery is against equity and good conscience.

I11(h) For the sole purpose of determining pay under this section, a dependent of a member of a uniformed service on active duty is treated as if he were a member. Any determination made by the Secretary concerned, or his designee, under this section in a case to which section 555 of this title applies is conclusive on all other departments and agencies of the United States. This subsection does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.

I11(2) Amounts so allotted shall bear interest at a rate which, for any calendar quarter, shall be equal to the average rate paid on United States Treasury bills with three-month maturities issued during the preceding calendar quarter. Such interest shall be computed quarterly.

I11(4) Any interest accruing under this subsection on_

I12(A) any amount for which a member is indebted to the United States under section 552(c) of this title shall be deemed to be part of the amount due under such section; and

I11(3)(A) The President_

I12(i) may defer such payment in the case of any former captive who during such one-year period is charged with an offense described in clause (ii), until final disposition of such charge; and

I12(ii) may deny such payment in the case of any former captive who is convicted of a captivity-related offense_

I13(I) referred to in subsection (b) or (c) of section 8312 of title 5; or

I13(II) under chapter 47 of title 10 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) that is punishable by dishonorable discharge, dismissal, or confinement for one year or more.

Q04

I11(B) For the purposes of subparagraph (A), a captivity-related offense is an offense that is_

I12(i) committed by a person while the person is in a captive status; and

I12(ii) related to the captive status of the person.

Q04

I11(4) A payment under this subsection is in addition to any other amount provided by law.

I11(5) Any amount due a person under this subsection shall, after the death of such person, be deemed to be pay and allowances for the purposes of this chapter.

I11(6) Any payment made under paragraph (1) that is later denied under paragraph (3)(A)(ii) is a claim of the United States Government for purposes of section 3711 of title 31.

I11(d) A determination by the President under subsection (a)(1) or (c) is final and is not subject to judicial review.

I21The words ``on active duty (other than for training)'' are substituted for the words ``on the active ... list'' to conform to longstanding administrative construction, and because there is no ``active list'' in the case of many of the uniformed services named, but only for certain regular component of those services, e.g., the ``Regular Army'' and the ``Regular Air Force''. The words ``a retired list of that service'' are substituted for the words ``retired list'', since there is more than one retired list for many of the services named. (See sections 1376, 3966, and 8966 of title 10, for example.) The words ``members of the Reserve components of the respective services entitled to Federal pay either on the active or any retired list of said services'' are omitted as covered by clause (1), since members of the reserve components are members of the uniformed services concerned. The word ``transferred'' is omitted as surplusage.

I11(b) The board shall consist of at least three qualified medical officers or physicians, one of whom is specially qualified in the treatment of mental disorders, appointed from available medical officers or physicians under his jurisdiction by the head of whichever of the following is providing medical treatment for the member, or by a person designated by that head_

I12(1) Department of the Army;

I12(2) Department of the Navy;

I12(3) Department of the Air Force;

I12(4) Department of Health and Human Services; or

I10If the hospitalization or medical care of the member is not provided by the United States, the board shall be appointed by the Secretary of the department having jurisdiction of the member.

I11(c) A payment made to a person who is designated under this section discharges the obligation of the United States as to the amount paid.

I11(d) A person serving in a legal, medical, fiduciary, or other capacity, may not demand or accept a fee, commission, or other charge for any service performed under this chapter.

I11(e) This section does not apply in any case in which a legal committee, guardian, or other representative has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, except as to payments made before the paying agency of the department concerned receives notice of that appointment.

I11(f) A person who is designated to receive payments under this section shall furnish satisfactory assurance that the amounts received by him will be applied to the use and benefit of the incompetent member, and, where the payments may reasonably be expected to be more than $1,000, shall provide a suitable bond to be paid for out of amounts due the incompetent member.

I11(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service may be paid in advance_

I12(1) not more than three months' pay of such member upon such member's change of permanent station; or

I12(2) the amount of an allotment made from such member's pay to a dependent if such member is assigned or scheduled for assignment to sea duty or other duty with a unit or command deployed or to be deployed outside the United States and the allotment is made by such member not more than sixty days before the scheduled date of the assignment of such member to such duty.

Q04

I11(b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service who is on duty at a distant station where the pay and emoluments to which he is entitled cannot be disbursed regularly, may be paid in advance.

I11(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an advance of pay to a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside the United States, or other place designated by the Secretary of Defense, of not more than two months' basic pay may be made to a member if the member or the dependents of the member are ordered evacuated by competent authority. An advance of pay under this subsection is not subject to the conditions under which advances of pay may be made under subsection (a) or (b). An advance may be made on the basis of the evacuation of a member's dependents only if all dependents of members of the uniformed services are ordered evacuated from the place where the member's dependents are located. In the case of a member with dependents, the payment may be made directly to dependents previously designated by the member. The Secretary concerned or his designee may waive any right of recovery of not more than one month's basic pay advanced under this subsection if he finds that recovery of the advance would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest.

I11(d) If a person to whom an advance of pay is made under subsection (a), (b), or (c) dies or is separated from his uniformed service, before liquidation of that advance, the amount remaining unliquidated at the time of his death or separation shall be credited to the account of the disbursing officer concerned. However, the unliquidated amount remains a debt of that person or his estate to the United States.

I11(e)(1) As far as practicable, regulations for the administration of subsections (a)ÿ09(d) shall be uniform for all of the uniformed services.

I11(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an obligation for an advance of pay made pursuant to this section shall be recorded as an obligation only in the fiscal year in which the entitlement of the member to the pay accrues.

I11(B) Current appropriations available for advance payments under this section may be transferred to the prior fiscal year appropriation available for the same purpose in the amount of any unliquidated advance payments that remain at the end of such prior fiscal year. Such unliquidated advance payments shall then be credited to the current appropriation.

I11(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Homeland Security, an advance of pay of not more than three months' pay may be made to an officer of the Coast Guard who is ordered to sea duty or to or from shore duty beyond the seas. In addition, the Commandant of the Coast Guard may direct such advances as he considers necessary and proper to members of the Coast Guard stationed at distant stations where the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled cannot be paid regularly.

I11(g) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the dislocation allowance authorized by section 477 of this title for a member of a uniformed service whose dependents are covered by section 475a(a) of this title may be paid in advance of the evacuation of the dependents and to the dependents designated by the member.

I11(h) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of section 3324 of title 31, the Secretary concerned may, when the last day of the pay period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, authorize the payment of pay and allowances to members of uniformed service under his jurisdiction on the preceding workday but not more than three days before the last day of that pay period. If a member dies after he has received an advance payment under this subsection, but before the last day of the pay period for which the payment is made, no part of the amount so advance is recoverable by the United States.

I11(i) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program upon reporting for a period of active duty required by section 2121(c) of title 10.

I11(j) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps who is ordered to field training or a practice required under section 2109 of title 10.
