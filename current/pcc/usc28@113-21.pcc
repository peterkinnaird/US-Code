I21Form of section was simplified.

I21The District of Columbia was added as a separate circuit.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 870.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A215 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A119, 36 Stat. 1131; Dec. 23, 1944, ch. 724, 58 Stat. 925).

I21The authority of the Chief Justice in vacation to assign a circuit justice to more than one circuit was extended by omitting the phrase ``whenever by reason of death or resignation, no Justice is allotted to a circuit.''

I21The provision in section 215 of Title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that, for the purposes of said section, the ``District of Columbia shall be deemed to be a judicial circuit,'' was omitted, since the District of Columbia is made a judicial circuit by section 41 of this title.

I21The last paragraph was added to make clear the intent of Congress that the powers of the Court to assign the justices among the several circuits should be completely flexible.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I80ÿ1A43

I89. Creation and composition of courts

I11(a) There shall be in each circuit a court of appeals, which shall be a court of record, known as the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit.

I11(b) Each court of appeals shall consist of the circuit judges of the circuit in regular active service. The circuit justice and justices or judges designated or assigned shall be competent to sit as judges of the court.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 870; Pub. L. 88ÿ09176, ÿ1A1(a), Nov. 13, 1963, 77 Stat. 331.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A212 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A117, 36 Stat. 1131).

I21The provision in section 212 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for a three-judge court of appeals was permissive and did not limit the power of the court to sit in banc. Thus, subsection (b) reflects present status of law, namely, that court is composed of not only circuit judges of the circuit in active service, of whom there may be more than three, but the circuit justice or justices and judges who may be assigned or designated to the court. (See T3Textile Mills Securities Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal RevenueK, 1942, 62 S.Ct. 272, 314 U.S. 326, 86 L.Ed. 249 and Reviser's Notes under section 46 of this title.)

I21Words ``with appellate jurisdiction, as hereinafter limited and established'' were omitted as covered by section 1291 et seq. of this title, conferring appellate jurisdiction on the courts of appeals.

I21The term ``court of appeals'' was substituted in this section and throughout this title for the term ``circuit court of appeals.''

I21Provision for a quorum of the court is now covered by section 46(d) of this title.

I74Amendments

I211963_Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 88ÿ09176 inserted ``regular'' before ``active service''.

I78Change of Name of Court

I21Act June 25, 1948, ch. 646, ÿ1A2(b), 62 Stat. 985, provided in part that each circuit court of appeals should, after Sept. 1, 1948, be known as a United States Court of Appeals, but that the enactment of act June 25, 1948 should in no way entail any loss of rights, interruption of jurisdiction, or prejudice to matters pending in any such courts on Sept. 1, 1948.

I80ÿ1A44

I89. Appointment, tenure, residence and salary of circuit judges

I21This section includes the members of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and designates them as ``judges'' rather than as ``justices'', thus harmonizing it with the provisions of section 41 of this title, which specifically designates the District of Columbia as a judicial circuit of the United States. In doing so it consolidates sections 11ÿ09201, 11ÿ09202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., which provided for one ``chief justice'' and five associate ``justices.''

I21Act February 9, 1893, established a court of appeals for the District of Columbia to consist of one chief justice and two associate justices whose jurisdiction was almost entirely to review the judgments of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, the name of which was changed in 1936 to the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia. Circuit courts were established by the first Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, ÿ1A4, and R.S. ÿ1A608, enacted June 22, 1874. R.S. ÿ1A605 provided that the words ``circuit justice'' and ``justice of a circuit'' should designate the justice of the Supreme Court of the United States allotted to any circuit; that ``judge'' when applied to any circuit included such justice.

I21The Judiciary Appropriation Act, 1945, Act June 26, 1944, ch. 277, ÿ1A202, 58 Stat. 358, provided that as used in that Act, ``the term `circuit court of appeals' includes the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; the term `senior circuit judge' includes the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term `circuit judge' includes associate justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and the term `judge' includes justice.''

I21Provisions in section 11ÿ09202 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and section 213 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of salaries in monthly installments were omitted, since time of payment is a matter of administrative convenience (20 Comp. Gen. 834).

I21The exception in subsection (c) extends to circuit judges in the District of Columbia the effect of the recent decision in T3U.S. ex rel. Laughlin v. EicherK, D.C. 1944, 56 F.Supp. 972, holding that residence requirement of section 1 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to district judges in the District of Columbia. (See Reviser's Note under section 134 of this title.)

I21The provision in section 213 of the title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that ``it shall be the duty of each circuit judge in each circuit to sit as one of the judges of the circuit court of appeals in that circuit from time to time according to law,'' was omitted as unnecessary since the duty to serve is implied by the creation and composition of the court in section 43 of this title.

I21Last sentence, providing that nothing in section 213 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., should prevent a circuit judge from holding district court as provided by law, was omitted as unnecessary. (See section 291 of this title authorizing assignments to district courts.)

I21Subsection (b) was added in conformity with the U.S. Constitution, art. 3.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I89. Chief judges; precedence of judges

I11(a)(1) The chief judge of the circuit shall be the circuit judge in regular active service who is senior in commission of those judges who_

I12(A) are sixty-four years of age or under;

I12(B) have served for one year or more as a circuit judge; and

I12(C) have not served previously as chief judge.

Q04

I11(2)(A) In any case in which no circuit judge meets the qualifications of paragraph (1), the youngest circuit judge in regular active service who is sixty-five years of age or over and who has served as circuit judge for one year or more shall act as the chief judge.

I11(B) In any case under subparagraph (A) in which there is no circuit judge in regular active service who has served as a circuit judge for one year or more, the circuit judge in regular active service who is senior in commission and who has not served previously as chief judge shall act as the chief judge.

I11(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the chief judge of the circuit appointed under paragraph (1) shall serve for a term of seven years and shall serve after expiration of such term until another judge is eligible under paragraph (1) to serve as chief judge of the circuit.

I11(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), a circuit judge acting as chief judge under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) shall serve until a judge has been appointed who meets the qualifications under paragraph (1).

I11(C) No circuit judge may serve or act as chief judge of the circuit after attaining the age of seventy years unless no other circuit judge is qualified to serve as chief judge of the circuit under paragraph (1) or is qualified to act as chief judge under paragraph (2).

I11(b) The chief judge shall have precedence and preside at any session of the court which he attends. Other circuit judges of the court in regular active service shall have precedence and preside according to the seniority of their commissions.

I21Based on sections 216 and 216a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A120, 36 Stat. 1132; May 23, 1934, ch. 339, 48 Stat. 796).

I21Subsection (a), providing for ``chief judge,'' is new. Such term is adopted to replace the term ``senior circuit judge'' in recognition of the great increase in administrative duties of such judge.

I21Subsection (b) conforms with section 4 of this title relating to precedence of associate justices of the Supreme Court, and consolidates the provisions of the second and third sentences of section 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The designation when filed in the court of appeals will not only record the transfer of function from the relieved chief judge to his successor, but will also determine the question of willingness of the successor to serve.

I21Other provisions of section 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are covered by section 47 of this title.

I21Subsection (c) is new.

I21Subsection (d) is based on section 216a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21The official status of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia holding office on the effective date of the act is preserved by section 2 of the bill to enact revised Title 28.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I89. Assignment of judges; panels; hearings; quorum

I11(a) Circuit judges shall sit on the court and its panels in such order and at such times as the court directs.

I11(b) In each circuit the court may authorize the hearing and determination of cases and controversies by separate panels, each consisting of three judges, at least a majority of whom shall be judges of that court, unless such judges cannot sit because recused or disqualified, or unless the chief judge of that court certifies that there is an emergency including, but not limited to, the unavailability of a judge of the court because of illness. Such panels shall sit at the times and places and hear the cases and controversies assigned as the court directs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall determine by rule a procedure for the rotation of judges from panel to panel to ensure that all of the judges sit on a representative cross section of the cases heard and, notwithstanding the first sentence of this subsection, may determine by rule the number of judges, not less than three, who constitute a panel.

I11(c) Cases and controversies shall be heard and determined by a court or panel of not more than three judges (except that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit may sit in panels of more than three judges if its rules so provide), unless a hearing or rehearing before the court in banc is ordered by a majority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in regular active service. A court in banc shall consist of all circuit judges in regular active service, or such number of judges as may be prescribed in accordance with section 6 of Public Law 95ÿ09486 (92 Stat. 1633), except that any senior circuit judge of the circuit shall be eligible (1) to participate, at his election and upon designation and assignment pursuant to section 294(c) of this title and the rules of the circuit, as a member of an in banc court reviewing a decision of a panel of which such judge was a member, or (2) to continue to participate in the decision of a case or controversy that was heard or reheard by the court in banc at a time when such judge was in regular active service.

I11(d) A majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof, as provided in paragraph (c), shall constitute a quorum.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based in part on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A212 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A117, 36 Stat. 1131).

I21Subsections (a)ÿ09(c) authorize the establishment of divisions of the court and provide for the assignment of circuit judges for hearings and rehearings in banc.

I21The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that, notwithstanding the three-judge provision of section 212 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., a court of appeals might lawfully consist of a greater number of judges, and that the five active circuit judges of the third circuit might sit in banc for the determination of an appeal. (See T3Textile Mills Securities Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal RevenueK, 1941, 62 S.Ct. 272, 314 U.S. 326, 86 L.Ed. 249.)

I21The Supreme Court in upholding the unanimous view of the five judges as to their right to sit in banc, notwithstanding the contrary opinion in T3Langs Estate v. Commissioner of Internal RevenueK, 1938, 97 F.2d 867, said in the Textile Mills case: ``There are numerous functions of the court, as a `court of record, with appellate jurisdiction', other than hearing and deciding appeals. Under the Judicial Code these embrace: prescribing the form of writs and other process and the form and style of its seal (28 U.S.C., ÿ1A219); the making of rules and regulations (28 U.S.C., ÿ1A219); the appointment of a clerk (28 U.S.C., ÿ1A221) and the approval of the appointment and removal of deputy clerks (28 U.S.C., ÿ1A222); and the fixing of the `times' when court shall be held (28 U.S.C., ÿ1A223). Furthermore, those various sections of the Judicial Code provide that each of these functions shall be performed by the court.''

I21This section preserves the interpretation established by the Textile Mills case but provides in subsection (c) that cases shall be heard by a court of not more than three judges unless the court has provided for hearing in banc. This provision continues the tradition of a three-judge appellate court and makes the decision of a division, the decision of the court, unless rehearing in banc is ordered. It makes judges available for other assignments, and permits a rotation of judges in such manner as to give to each a maximum of time for the preparation of opinions.

I21Whether divisions should sit simultaneously at the same or different places in the circuit is a matter for each court to determine.

I211963_Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 88ÿ09176 inserted ``regular'' before ``active service'' wherever appearing, and provided that a retired circuit judge shall be competent to sit as a judge of the court in banc, in a rehearing if he sat in at the original hearing.

The provisions of said section 375 relating to resignation and retirement of judges, and appointment of court officers, are incorporated in sections 294, 371, and 756 of this title. Other provisions of said section 11ÿ09301 of the District of Columbia Code are incorporated in section 133 of this title.

I21Subsection (a), providing for a ``chief judge'' is new. Such term replaces the terms ``senior district judge,'' and ``Chief Justice'' of the District Court in the District of Columbia. It is employed in view of the great increase of administrative duties of such judge. The use of the term ``chief judge'' with respect to the District of Columbia will result in uniform nomenclature for all district courts. The district judges of that court have expressed approval of such designation.

I21The provision in said section 11ÿ09301 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., that the ``Chief Justice'' shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was omitted for the purpose of establishing a uniform method of creating the position of chief judge in all districts. The District of Columbia is expressly made a judicial district by section 88 of this title.

I21Subsection (b) is new and conforms with similar provisions respecting associate justices of the Supreme Court and circuit judges in sections 4 and 45 of this title.

I21 Subsection (c) is from the proviso in the second paragraph of section 375 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which applied only in cases of appointment of court officers. Here it is made applicable to all district judges.

I21Subsections (d) and (e) are new, and conform with section 44 of this title relating to precedence of circuit judges.

I21The official status of the Chief Justice of the District Court for the District of Columbia holding office at the effective date of this act is preserved by section 2 of the bill to enact revised title 28.

I21The ``Board of General Appraisers'' was designated ``United States Customs Court'' by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, ÿ1A1, 44 Stat. 669. General provisions concerning such court were incorporated in section 1518 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, until amended by act October 10, 1940, ch. 843, ÿ1A1, 54 Stat. 1101, adding a new section to the Judicial Code of 1911, when they were transferred to section 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. They are retained in title 28 by this revision.

I21In this connection former Congressman Walter Chandler said, ``Among the major subjects needing study and revision are special courts, such as the Customs Court, which should be fitted into the judicial system.'' (See U.S. Law Weekly, Nov. 7, 1939.)

I74History of Court

I21The United States Customs Court [now Court of International Trade] as ``constituted on June 17, 1930'', consisted of nine members as provided by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, ÿ1A518, 42 Stat. 972, which established the Board of General Appraisers, designated the ``United States Customs Court'' by act May 28, 1926, ch. 411, ÿ1A1, 44 Stat. 669.

I21Provisions similar to these were contained in act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, ÿ1A518, 42 Stat. 972. That section was superseded by section 518 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and was repealed by section 651 (a)(1) of said 1930 act.

I21The sentence in the former first paragraph as to sitting in a case previously participated in, is from act Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, ÿ1A28, 36 Stat. 98, which combined and amended Customs Administrative Act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, ÿ1A12, 26 Stat. 136, and section 31, as added by act May 27, 1908, ch. 205, 35 Stat. 406. Section 12 of the act of 1890 was expressly saved from repeal by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, ÿ1A643, 42 Stat. 989, and prior acts, but its provisions, other than the sentence above mentioned, were omitted from the Code.

I21Provisions for the review of decisions of Boards of General Appraisers by the Circuit Courts, made by section 15 of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, were superseded by provisions for such review by the Court of Customs Appeals created by section 29 added to that act by the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6. The provisions of said new section 29 were incorporated in and superseded by chapter 8 of the Judicial Code of March 3, 1911, incorporated into the Code as former chapter 8 of Title 28, Judicial Code and Judiciary.

I21R.S. ÿ1A2608 provided for the appointment of four appraisers of merchandise, to be employed in visiting ports of entry under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and to assist in the appraisement of merchandise as might be deemed necessary by the Secretary to protect and insure uniformity in the collection of the revenue from customs. It was repealed by act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, ÿ1A29, 26 Stat. 141.

I21R.S. ÿ1A2609 provided for the appointment of merchant appraisers. R.S. ÿ1A2610 made every merchant refusing to serve as such appraiser liable to a penalty. Both sections were superseded by the provisions relating to appraisers and appraisements of the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, 26 Stat. 131, and subsequent acts, and were repealed by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, title IV, ÿ1A642, 42 Stat. 989.

I21R.S. ÿ1A2945, which contained a provision similar to that of R.S. ÿ1A2610, was repealed, without mention of section 2610, by said Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, ÿ1A29, 26 Stat. 141, and was again repealed by act Sept. 21, 1922, ch. 356, ÿ1A642, 42 Stat. 989.

I21R.S. ÿ1A2725, which prescribed the compensation of merchant appraisers, and section 2726, which prescribed the salary of the general appraiser at New York, were superseded by the provisions relating to general appraisers and appraisers made by the Customs Administrative Act of June 10, 1890, ch. 407, ÿ1A12, 13, 26 Stat. 136, as amended by the Payne-Aldrich Act of Aug. 5, 1909, ch. 6, ÿ1A28.

I21R.S. ÿ1A2727 fixed the salary of the four general appraisers at the sum of $2,500 a year each, and their actual traveling expenses. It was repealed by act Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, 19 Stat. 246.

I21The revised section omits a reference to the Chief Justice contained in said section 22, since in exercising the powers under subsection (b), he acts as a circuit justice.

I21Paragraph (d) of said section 17, making the section applicable to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, is omitted since such court is included in this revision because the District of Columbia is made a separate circuit. (See section 41 of this title.)

The revised section and sections 294 and 296 of this title make clear the power to make designation and assignment without any limitation of time, to revoke such designation and assignment and to make, from time to time, new designations and assignments.

I21The term ``chief judge'' of the circuit was substituted for ``senior circuit judge.'' (See reviser's note under section 136 of this title.)

I21Section consolidates and simplifies all provisions of sections 17, 21 and 216 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to designation and assignment of district judges.

I21Term ``chief judge'' was substituted for ``senior circuit judge.'' (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)

I21Sections 17 and 21 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were inconsistent insofar as the words ``or in his absence, the circuit judges thereof,'' appearing in said section 17 were not in section 21, and the words ``senior circuit judge then present in the circuit,'' appearing in section 21 were not in section 17. The revised section omits all such words and leaves designation of assignment to the chief judge of the circuit. If the chief judge is unable to perform his duties they devolve, under section 45 of this title, upon the circuit judge next in seniority of commission.

I21The provision of said section 17, that designation of a district judge to another circuit should be from an adjacent circuit if practicable, was omitted as an unnecessary restriction on the discretion of the Chief Justice.

I21Section 19 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is omitted as unnecessary. It authorized the Chief Justice of the United States to designate and assign any district judge to a district upon receiving a certificate from the clerk of the district that all circuit judges and the circuit justice were absent from the circuit, or were unable to appoint a substitute judge for the district,or where the district judge actually designated was disabled or neglected to hold court.

I21For omission of reference in said section 17 to senior Associate Justice, see reviser's note under section 291 of this title.

I21Reference in said section 17 to retired judges were omitted as covered by section 294 of this title.

I21Other provisions of said section 17 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 291, 295, and 296 of this title. Other provisions of said section 216 of such title are incorporated in sections 45 and 47 of this title.

I21Words ``either in a district court or court of appeals'' were inserted in subsection (c) as suggested by Hon. Learned Hand, Senior Circuit Judge of the Second Circuit. The revised section permits a district judge to be assigned directly to the circuit court of appeals of another circuit. Under existing law it has been assumed that he must be assigned to serve as a district judge on the other circuit and then designated to serve on the circuit court of appeals by that court in which his services are required.

I21Many changes were made in phraseology.

I74Amendments

I211982_Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 97ÿ09164 struck out ``the Court of Claims, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals or'' after ``to serve as a judge of'' and ``in which the need arises'' after ``chief judge of the court''.

I211980_Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 96ÿ09417 redesignated the Customs Court as the Court of International Trade.

(d) by substituting ``in a bankruptcy court, district court, or court of appeals'' for ``either in a district court or court of appeals'', which amendments did not become effective pursuant to section 402(b) of Pub.

I11(2) In a case in which a justice or judge who retires under paragraph (1) does not meet the requirements of subsection (e), the justice or judge shall continue to receive the salary that he or she was receiving when he or she was last in active service or, if a certification under subsection (e) was made for such justice or judge, when such a certification was last in effect. The salary of such justice or judge shall be adjusted under section 461 of this title.

I11(d) The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a successor to a justice or judge who retires under this section.

I11(e)(1) In order to continue receiving the salary of the office under subsection (b), a justice must be certified in each calendar year by the Chief Justice, and a judge must be certified by the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits, as having met the requirements set forth in at least one of the following subparagraphs:

I12(A) The justice or judge must have carried in the preceding calendar year a caseload involving courtroom participation which is equal to or greater than the amount of work involving courtroom participation which an average judge in active service would perform in three months. In the instance of a justice or judge who has sat on both district courts and courts of appeals, the caseload of appellate work and trial work shall be determined separately and the results of those determinations added together for purposes of this paragraph.

I12(B) The justice or judge performed in the preceding calendar year substantial judicial duties not involving courtroom participation under subparagraph (A), including settlement efforts, motion decisions, writing opinions in cases that have not been orally argued, and administrative duties for the court to which the justice or judge is assigned. Any certification under this subparagraph shall include a statement describing in detail the nature and amount of work and certifying that the work done is equal to or greater than the work described in this subparagraph which an average judge in active service would perform in three months.

I12(C) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed work described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) in an amount which, when calculated in accordance with such subparagraphs, in the aggregate equals at least 3 months work.

I12(D) The justice or judge has, in the preceding calendar year, performed substantial administrative duties directly related to the operation of the courts, or has performed substantial duties for a Federal or State governmental entity. A certification under this subparagraph shall specify that the work done is equal to the full-time work of an employee of the judicial branch. In any year in which a justice or judge performs work described under this subparagraph for less than the full year, one-half of such work may be aggregated with work described under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph for the purpose of the justice or judge satisfying the requirements of such subparagraph.

I12(E) The justice or judge was unable in the preceding calendar year to perform judicial or administrative work to the extent required by any of subparagraphs (A) through (D) because of a temporary or permanent disability. A certification under this subparagraph shall be made to a justice who certifies in writing his or her disability to the Chief Justice, and to a judge who certifies in writing his or her disability to the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge sits. A justice or judge who is certified under this subparagraph as having a permanent disability shall be deemed to have met the requirements of this subsection for each calendar year thereafter.

Q04

I11(2) Determinations of work performed under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1) shall be made pursuant to rules promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States. In promulgating such criteria, the Judicial Conference shall take into account existing standards promulgated by the Conference for allocation of space and staff for senior judges.

I11(3) If in any year a justice or judge who retires under subsection (b) does not receive a certification under this subsection (except as provided in paragraph (1)(E)), he or she may thereafter receive a certification for that year by satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in a subsequent year and attributing a sufficient part of the work performed in such subsequent year to the earlier year so that the work so attributed, when added to the work performed during such earlier year, satisfies the requirements for certification for that year. However, a justice or judge may not receive credit for the same work for purposes of certification for more than 1 year.

I11(4) In the case of any justice or judge who retires under subsection (b) during a calendar year, there shall be included in the determination under this subsection of work performed during that calendar year all work performed by that justice or judge (as described in subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph (1)) during that calendar year before such retirement.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A375 and 375a (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A260, 36 Stat. 1161; Feb. 25, 1919, ch. 29, ÿ1A6, 40 Stat. 1157; Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 419, 45 Stat. 1422; Mar. 1, 1937, ch. 21, ÿ1A1, 2, 50 Stat. 24; Feb. 11, 1938, ch. 25, ÿ1A1, 52 Stat. 28; May 11, 1944, ch. 192, ÿ1A1, 58 Stat. 218).

I21This section consolidates provisions of sections 375 and 375a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to resignation and retirement. Remaining provisions of said section 375 now appear in sections 136, 294, and 756 of this title, and remaining provisions of said section 375a now appear in section 294 of this title.

I21Words ``may resign, or may retain his office but retire from regular active service'' were used to clarify the difference between resignation and retirement. Resignation results in loss of the judge's office, while retirement does not. (T3Booth v. U.SK., 1933, 54 S. Ct. 379, 291 U.S. 339, 78 L. Ed. 836; T3U.S. v. MooreK, 1939, 101 F. 2d 56, certiorari denied 59 S. Ct. 788, 306 U.S. 664, 83 L. Ed. 1060.)

I21Terms ``judge of the United States'' and ``justice of the United States'' are defined in section 451 of this title.

I21The revised section continues the provision respecting the salary of a resigned judge but changes such provision for retired judges and makes them eligible to receive any increases provided by Congress for the office from which they retired. This change is in harmony with the clear line of distinction drawn by Congress between retirement and resignation.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A375b, 375c, and 375d (Aug. 5, 1939, ch. 433, ÿ1A1ÿ093, 53 Stat. 1204, 1205).

I21This section consolidates sections 375b, 375c, and 375d of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Section 375e of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. providing that term ``senior circuit judge'' includes the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and the term ``judicial circuit'' includes the District of Columbia, was omitted from this revision as unnecessary. Such district is included as a judicial circuit by section 41 of this title.

I21Words ``justice or judge of the United States'' were used to describe members of all courts who hold office during good behavior. (See reviser's note under section 371 of this title.)

I21Term ``chief judge'' was substituted for ``Chief Justice'' of the Court of Claims, ``presiding judge'' of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and ``senior circuit judge.'' (See Reviser's Note under section 136 of this title.)

I21For clarity and convenience the requirement that certificates of disability be submitted ``to the President,'' was made explicit.

I21The revised section requires a judge of the Customs Court to furnish a certificate of disability signed by the chief judge of his court, instead of by the chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as in said section 375c of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. This change insures signing of the certificate of disability by the chief judge possessing knowledge of the facts.

I21Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

I711949 T4Act

I21Subsection (a) of this section amends section 372 of title 28, U.S.C., to express the requirement that appointment of successors to justices or judges must be made with confirmation by the Senate. Subsection (b) of this section clarifies the intent of section 372 of title 28, U.S.C., and conforms with the language of section 371 of such title.

Q04

I11(r) Nothing contained in this section shall be interpreted to prevent a widow or widower eligible for an annuity under this section from simultaneously receiving such an annuity while also receiving any other annuity to which such widow or widower may also be entitled under any other law without regard to this section: T3ProvidedK, That service used in the computation of the annuity conferred by this section shall not also be credited in computing any such other annuity.

An election under this subsection shall be made at the time of retirement, or, if later, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the judicial official is dissolved. An election under this subsection_

I12(1) shall not be effective to the extent that it_

I13(A) conflicts with_

I14(i) any court order or decree referred to in subsection (t)(1), which was issued before the date of such election, or

I14(ii) any agreement referred to in such subsection which was entered into before such date; or

I11(2) The annuity payable to a former spouse under this subsection may not exceed the difference between_

I12(A) the maximum amount that would be payable as an annuity to a widow or widower under subsection (T3lK), determined without taking into account any reduction of such annuity caused by payment of an annuity to a former spouse; and

I12(B) the amount of any annuity payable under this subsection to any other former spouse of the judicial official, based on an election previously made under subsection (s), or a court order previously issued.

Q04

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A334 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A227, 36 Stat. 1154; Mar. 4, 1911, ch. 285, ÿ1A1, 36 Stat. 1419; July 1, 1922, ch. 267, ÿ1A3, 42 Stat. 816; June 12, 1926, ch. 568, 44 Stat. 736; Jan. 29, 1929, ch. 113, 45 Stat. 1143; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, ÿ1A1, 45 Stat. 1475; July 3, 1930, ch. 863, ÿ1A1, 46 Stat. 1016; Feb. 23, 1931, ch. 276, ÿ1A30, 46 Stat. 1214; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158; June 30, 1932, ch. 314, ÿ1A501, 47 Stat. 415; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, ÿ1A512, 48 Stat. 758; Ex. Ord. No. 6166, ÿ1A12, 14, June 10, 1933; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; May 27, 1936, ch. 463, ÿ1A1, 49 Stat. 1380; June 20, 1936, ch. 630, ÿ1A5, 49 Stat. 1549; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921).

I21Requirements for printing, binding, and issuing Supreme Court decisions ``within eight months after said decisions have been rendered by the Supreme Court'' and provision for distribution ``within said period'' were omitted. The phrase ``as soon as practicable after rendition'' was made the time for publishing such decisions as more flexible and practicable.

I21The words ``the United States Court for China'' were omitted inasmuch as that court is no longer functioning. The Secretary of State by an arrangement with China has relinquished the extraterritorial jurisdiction previously exercised by the United States in China. The 1944 Legislative and Judiciary Appropriation Act approved June 28, 1943, made no appropriation for the United States Court for China. Appropriations for other courts were made in title II of chapter 173 (57 Stat. 241). The last appropriation for the United States Court for China was in the act of July 2, 1942 (ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 502).

I21The words ``to the Secretary of War for the use of the proper courts and officers of the Philippine Islands, seven copies'' were omitted in view of the independence of the Philippines, effective July 4, 1946.

I21The phrase ``justice or judge of the United States'' obviated repetition of names of courts. (See definitive section 451 of this title.)

I21Last sentence, fourth paragraph, of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that books should remain the property of the United States and should be preserved and turned over to successors in office, was omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.

I21A reference to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by ``each United States attorney.''

I21Provision authorizing distribution of volumes under this section to each place where a court of appeals is held was added for purposes of uniformity. See similar provision in section 413 of this title.

I21The revised section substitutes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in lieu of the Attorney General insofar as distribution of volumes to the judiciary is concerned. This change is consistent with the duties of the former under section 601 et seq. of this title.

I21Provision of section 334 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to the custody, use and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

I21The limitation of 10 copies to the library of the Supreme Court and 6 copies to the marshal of the Supreme Court for use of the justices, was omitted and the provision for distribution in such number ``specified by the Chief Justice of the United States'' was substituted therefor.

I21Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Acts July 1, 1922, ch. 267, ÿ1A5, 42 Stat. 818; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, ÿ1A3, 44 Stat. 678 which is omitted, but not repealed, as unnecessary in this revision.

I21Subsection (a) of this section substitutes, in section 411(a) of title 28, U.S.C., ``Secretary of the Army'' and ``Department of the Army'' for ``Secretary of War'' and ``War Department,'' in view of such redesignation by act of July 26, 1947 (ch. 343, title II, ÿ1A205(a), 61 Stat. 501). It substitutes, in section 411(a), ``Commissioner of Customs; Commandant of the Coast Guard'' for ``Chief of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation,'' in view of the abolishment of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, and the transfer of its functions to, and the division thereof between, the Commissioner of Customs and the Commandant of the Coast Guard, by 1946 Reorganization Plan No. 3, ÿ1A101ÿ09104, effective July 16, 1946 (11 F.R. 7875, 60 Stat. 1097).

I21It substitutes, in such section 411(a), ``Director of the Bureau of Land Management'' for ``Commissioner of the General Land Office,'' in view of section 403 of such plan which abolished the General Land Office and created the Bureau of Land Management, headed by a Director. It inserts as new, in such section 411(a), references to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, and Judge Advocate General of the Air Force, in view of the creation of the National Military Establishment, headed by the Secretary of Defense, and the establishment of the Department of the Air Force in 1947.

I21Subsection (b) of this section redesignates, in section 411(b) of title 28, U.S.C., the Secretary of War as ``Secretary of the Army,'' for the reasons stated above, and corrects a typographical error in the word ``court-martial''.

I211951_Subsec. (c). Act Oct. 31, 1951, in second par., substituted ``Secretary of the Army'' for ``Secretary of War''.

I211949_Subsec. (a). Act May 24, 1949, ÿ1A68(a), inserted ``Secretary of Defense'', ``Secretary of the Air Force'', and ``Judge Advocate General of the Air Force'' where appearing, and substituted ``Secretary of the Army'' for ``Secretary of War'', ``Department of the Army'' for ``War Department'', ``Director of the Bureau of Land Management'' for ``Commissioner of the General Land Office'', ``Commissioner of Customs, Commandant of the Coast Guard'' for ``Chief of the Bureau of Marine Inspection'', and ``Chief of Forest Service, Department of Agriculture'' for ``Chief Forester, National Park Service, Department of the Interior''.

I21Subsec. (b). Act May 24, 1949, ÿ1A68(b), substituted ``Secretary of the Army'' for ``Secretary of War'' and ``Court-martial'' for ``courtmartial''.

I89. Sale of Supreme Court reports

I11The Public Printer, or other printer designated by the Supreme Court of the United States shall print such additional bound volumes and preliminary prints of such reports as may be required for sale to the public.

I21Reference to digests was omitted to conform to administrative practice. (See section 604(a)(9) of this title.)

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A337, 530 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A229, 36 Stat. 1155; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, ÿ1A1, 45 Stat. 1475; May 10, 1934, ch. 277, ÿ1A512, 48 Stat. 758; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 926; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, ÿ1A1131, 53 Stat. 163; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504; June 28, 1943, ch. 173, title II, ÿ1A201, 57 Stat. 243; June 26, 1944, ch. 277, ÿ1A203, 58 Stat. 358; May 21, 1945, ch. 129, title IV, 59 Stat. 200; July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title IV, 60 Stat. 480.)

I21Section consolidates provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to expenditures for ``lawbooks'' for the Tax Court of the United States, with sections 337 and 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to purchase and distribution of reporter and digest volumes.

I21Other provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 604 of this title.

I21Provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., limiting the price to be paid for volumes of the Federal Reporter and other similar reports were omitted after consultation with the Administrative Office of United States Courts as more properly covered by current appropriation acts. Similar provisions relating to the Federal Digest and the United States Code Annotated were omitted as covered in current appropriation acts. (See Act June 29, 1944, ch. 286, title II, ÿ1A212, 58 Stat. 361, 387.)

I21Provisions of said section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that books are to remain United States property, so marked, and transmitted to successors in office of persons receiving them, were omitted as covered by section 414 of this title.

I21Similar provisions in said section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in section 414 of this title.

I21Provision in section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for distribution to the Court of Appeals and District Court for the District of Columbia was omitted as covered by the phrase ``Each place where a circuit court of appeals or district court is regularly held.''

I21The revised section is extended to include the Customs Court as well as the Court of Claims and Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. All judges receive the Supreme Court reports and digests under section 411 of this title. Presumably the Congress did not intend to deny distribution of the Federal Reporter and digests to the Customs Court while providing for all other courts under said section 337.

I21The revised section provides for distribution of volumes to the judiciary by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. (See reviser's note under section 411 of this title.)

I21Provision of section 337 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to custody, use, and delivery to successors was omitted as obsolete on advice of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.

I21Section consolidates section 90 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that ``statutes'' shall be delivered to successors of United States attorneys and clerks and provisions of section 530 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that all lawbooks for judges and others shall be marked as property of the United States and shall be transmitted to their successors, with section 92 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to transmittal of ``Government publications.''

I21Words ``All Government publications and lawbooks'' and ``furnished under this chapter'' were used to cover ``all statutes'' and ``The Federal Reporter and continuations thereto.''

I21Sections 13 and 302 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to district courts and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and this section has been written to cover all other courts of the United States.

I21The phrase ``always open'' means ``never closed'' and signifies the time when a court can exercise its functions. With respect to matters enumerated by statute or rule as to which the court is ``always open,'' there is no time when the court is without power to act. (Ex parte Branch, 63 Ala. 383, 387.)

I21Section 13 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided that ``The district courts, as courts of admiralty and as courts of equity, shall be deemed always open***'' for enumerated purposes, and that the judge ``at chambers or in the clerk's office, and in vacation as well as in term,'' may make orders and issue process. The revised section omits all reference to the nature of the action or proceeding and enumeration of the acts which may be performed by the court.

I11(f) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, if any justice, judge, magistrate judge, or bankruptcy judge to whom a matter has been assigned would be disqualified, after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter, because of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to him or her, that he or she individually or as a fiduciary, or his or her spouse or minor child residing in his or her household, has a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the justice, judge, magistrate judge, bankruptcy judge, spouse or minor child, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.

I21Section 24 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to district judges. The revised section is made applicable to all justices and judges of the United States.

I21The phrase ``in which he has a substantial interest'' was substituted for ``concerned in interest in any suit.''

Such provision is not made by statute in case of disqualification or incapacity, for other cause. See sections 140, 143, and 144 of this title. If a judge or clerk of court is remiss in failing to notify the chief judge of the district or circuit, the judicial council of the circuit has ample power under section 332 of this title to apply a remedy.

I21Relationship to a party's attorney is included in the revised section as a basis of disqualification in conformity with the views of judges cognizant of the grave possibility of undesirable consequences resulting from a less inclusive rule.

I21Section consolidates and simplifies sections 10, 523a and 523b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to filing district court records and destroying obsolete papers and bankruptcy proofs of claims.

I21The revised section enlarges scope of section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to include places of keeping records of courts of appeals which was not covered by existing law.

I21The provisions in section 10 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that where court is held ``at more than one place'' and the place of keeping the records ``is not specially provided by law, they shall be kept at either of the places'' designated by the court, was changed to permit the judicial councils of the circuits to make the determination without requiring special enactment of Congress. See section 332 of this title as to purpose and duties of the judicial councils.

I21The provision of section 523a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing destruction of records by the Attorney General was rewritten in the second paragraph to give such authority, respecting court records, to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Such Director, under section 604 of this title, now exercises administrative authority over clerks and commissioners.

I21A similar provision with respect to records of United States attorneys and marshals was omitted as superseded by sections 366 and 380 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents, which prescribe the exclusive method for disposition of such papers.

I21Substantial changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

I21Section consolidates provisions of sections 264 and 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., section 1509 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to administration of oaths and acknowledgments by judges and courts.

I21The provision of section 385 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., giving to ``all courts of the United States'' power to impose and administer all necessary oaths is the only part of such section in this title. The remainder is incorporated in section 401 of revised title 18, U.S.C. (H.R. 1600, 80th Cong.), Crimes and Criminal Procedure.

I21Section 264 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to the Court of Claims and provision of such section relating to clerks and deputies is incorporated in section 953 of this title.

I21Section 1509 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to the Customs Court.

I21Section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to The Tax Court. That portion of such section authorizing certain employees of The Tax Court to administer oaths and acknowledgments is incorporated in section 953 of this title. For distribution of other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated, therefore, as finally enacted, section 1114(a) of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, did not constitute part of the source of this section. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I11There shall be implemented by each United States district court, in accordance with this chapter, a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan. The plan may be a plan developed by such district court or a model plan developed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The purposes of each plan are to facilitate deliberate adjudication of civil cases on the merits, monitor discovery, improve litigation management, and ensure just, speedy, and inexpensive resolutions of civil disputes.

I74Congressional Statement of Findings

I21Pub. L. 101ÿ09650, title I, ÿ1A102, Dec. 1, 1990, 104 Stat. 5089, provided that: ``The Congress makes the following findings:

I22``(1) The problems of cost and delay in civil litigation in any United States district court must be addressed in the context of the full range of demands made on the district court's resources by both civil and criminal matters.

I22``(2) The courts, the litigants, the litigants' attorneys, and the Congress and the executive branch, share responsibility for cost and delay in civil litigation and its impact on access to the courts, adjudication of cases on the merits, and the ability of the civil justice system to provide proper and timely judicial relief for aggrieved parties.

I22``(3) The solutions to problems of cost and delay must include significant contributions by the courts, the litigants, the litigants' attorneys, and by the Congress and the executive branch.

I22``(4) In identifying, developing, and implementing solutions to problems of cost and delay in civil litigation, it is necessary to achieve a method of consultation so that individual judicial officers, litigants, and litigants' attorneys who have developed techniques for litigation management and cost and delay reduction can effectively and promptly communicate those techniques to all participants in the civil justice system.

I22``(5) Evidence suggests that an effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction program should incorporate several interrelated principles, including_

I23``(A) the differential treatment of cases that provides for individualized and specific management according to their needs, complexity, duration, and probable litigation careers;

I23``(B) early involvement of a judicial officer in planning the progress of a case, controlling the discovery process, and scheduling hearings, trials, and other litigation events;

I23``(C) regular communication between a judicial officer and attorneys during the pretrial process; and

I23``(D) utilization of alternative dispute resolution programs in appropriate cases.

I22``(6) Because the increasing volume and complexity of civil and criminal cases imposes increasingly heavy workload burdens on judicial officers, clerks of court, and other court personnel, it is necessary to create an effective administrative structure to ensure ongoing consultation and communication regarding effective litigation management and cost and delay reduction principles and techniques.''

I12(1) systematic, differential treatment of civil cases that tailors the level of individualized and case specific management to such criteria as case complexity, the amount of time reasonably needed to prepare the case for trial, and the judicial and other resources required and available for the preparation and disposition of the case;

I12(2) early and ongoing control of the pretrial process through involvement of a judicial officer in_

I13(A) assessing and planning the progress of a case;

I13(B) setting early, firm trial dates, such that the trial is scheduled to occur within eighteen months after the filing of the complaint, unless a judicial officer certifies that_

I14(i) the demands of the case and its complexity make such a trial date incompatible with serving the ends of justice; or

I14(ii) the trial cannot reasonably be held within such time because of the complexity of the case or the number or complexity of pending criminal cases;

Q04

I13(C) controlling the extent of discovery and the time for completion of discovery, and ensuring compliance with appropriate requested discovery in a timely fashion; and

I13(D) setting, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;

Q04

I12(3) for all cases that the court or an individual judicial officer determines are complex and any other appropriate cases, careful and deliberate monitoring through a discovery-case management conference or a series of such conferences at which the presiding judicial officer_

I13(A) explores the parties' receptivity to, and the propriety of, settlement or proceeding with the litigation;

I13(B) identifies or formulates the principal issues in contention and, in appropriate cases, provides for the staged resolution or bifurcation of issues for trial consistent with Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure;

I13(C) prepares a discovery schedule and plan consistent with any presumptive time limits that a district court may set for the completion of discovery and with any procedures a district court may develop to_

I14(i) identify and limit the volume of discovery available to avoid unnecessary or unduly burdensome or expensive discovery; and

I14(ii) phase discovery into two or more stages; and

Q04

I13(D) sets, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;

Q04

I12(4) encouragement of cost-effective discovery through voluntary exchange of information among litigants and their attorneys and through the use of cooperative discovery devices;

I12(5) conservation of judicial resources by prohibiting the consideration of discovery motions unless accompanied by a certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and good faith effort to reach agreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the motion; and

I12(6) authorization to refer appropriate cases to alternative dispute resolution programs that_

I13(A) have been designated for use in a district court; or

I13(B) the court may make available, including mediation, minitrial, and summary jury trial.

Q04

I11(b) In formulating the provisions of its civil justice expense and delay reduction plan, each United States district court, in consultation with an advisory group appointed under section 478 of this title, shall consider and may include the following litigation management and cost and delay reduction techniques:

I12(1) a requirement that counsel for each party to a case jointly present a discovery-case management plan for the case at the initial pretrial conference, or explain the reasons for their failure to do so;

I12(2) a requirement that each party be represented at each pretrial conference by an attorney who has the authority to bind that party regarding all matters previously identified by the court for discussion at the conference and all reasonably related matters;

I12(3) a requirement that all requests for extensions of deadlines for completion of discovery or for postponement of the trial be signed by the attorney and the party making the request;

I12(4) a neutral evaluation program for the presentation of the legal and factual basis of a case to a neutral court representative selected by the court at a nonbinding conference conducted early in the litigation;

I12(5) a requirement that, upon notice by the court, representatives of the parties with authority to bind them in settlement discussions be present or available by telephone during any settlement conference; and

I12(6) such other features as the district court considers appropriate after considering the recommendations of the advisory group referred to in section 472(a) of this title.

Q04

I74Message of the President

I33To the Congress of the United States:

Q02

I21In my first Reorganization Plan of 1968, I call for the creation of a new and powerful Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

I21With this action, America will serve notice to the pusher and the peddler that their criminal acts must stop.

I21No matter how well organized they are, we will be better organized. No matter how well they have concealed their activities, we will root them out.

I21Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics laws are fragmented. One major element_the Bureau of Narcotics_is in the Treasury Department and responsible for the control of marihuana and narcotics such as heroin. Another_the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control_is in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and is responsible for the control of dangerous drugs including depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens such as LSD.

I21Neither is located in the agency which is primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement_the Department of Justice.

I21This separation of responsibilities_despite the relentless and dedicated efforts of the agents of each Bureau_has complicated and hindered our response to a national menace.

I21For example, more than nine out of ten seizures of LSD made by the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control have also turned up marihuana_but that Bureau has no jurisdiction over marihuana.

I21In many instances, we are confronted by well organized disciplined and resourceful criminals who reap huge profits at the expense of their unfortunate victims.

I21The response of the Federal Government must be unified. And it must be total.

I21Today, in my Message on Crime, I recommended strong new laws to control dangerous drugs. I also recommended an increase of more than thirty percent in the number of Federal agents enforcing the narcotic and dangerous drug laws.

I21I now propose that a single Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs be established in the Department of Justice to administer those laws and to bring to the American people the most efficient and effective Federal enforcement machinery we can devise.

I21Under this Reorganization Plan the Attorney General will have full authority and responsibility for enforcing the Federal laws relating to narcotics and dangerous drugs. The new Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, to be headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General, will:

I34_consolidate the authority and preserve the experience and manpower of the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.

I34_work with states and local governments in their crackdown on illegal trade in drugs and narcotics, and help to train local agents and investigators.

I34_maintain worldwide operations, working closely with other nations, to suppress the trade in illicit narcotics and marihuana.

I34_conduct an extensive campaign of research and a nationwide public education program on drug abuse and its tragic effects.

I21The Plan I forward today moves in the direction recommended by two distinguished groups:

I34_1949 Hoover Commission.

I34_the 1963 Presidential Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse.

I21This Administration and this Congress have the will and the determination to stop the illicit traffic in drugs.

I21But we need more than the will and the determination. We need a modern and efficient instrument of Government to transform our plans into action. That is what this Reorganization Plan calls for.

I21The Plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.

I21I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code.

I21I have also found that, by reason of these reorganizations, it is necessary to include in the accompanying plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the five new positions as specified in section 3 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these new positions are those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable positions in the Executive Branch of the Government.

I21Should the reorganization I propose take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of Federal law enforcement functions. It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the reduction in expenditures which may result.

I21I recommend that the Congress allow this urgently needed and important Reorganization Plan to become effective.

I74Message of the President

I33To the Congress of the United States:

Q02

I21Drug abuse is one of the most vicious and corrosive forces attacking the foundations of American society today. It is a major cause of crime and a merciless destroyer of human lives. We must fight it with all of the resources at our command.

I21This Administration has declared all-out, global war on the drug menace. As I reported to the Congress earlier this month in my State of the Union message, there is evidence of significant progress on a number of fronts in that war.

I21Both the rate of new addiction to heroin and the number of narcotic-related deaths showed an encouraging downturn last year. More drug addicts and abusers are in treatment and rehabilitation programs than ever before.

I21Progress in pinching off the supply of illicit drugs was evident in last year's stepped-up volume of drug seizures worldwide_which more than doubled in 1972 over the 1971 level.

I21Arrests of traffickers have risen by more than one-third since 1971. Prompt Congressional action on my proposal for mandatory minimum sentences for pushers of hard drugs will help ensure that convictions stemming from such arrests lead to actual imprisonment of the guilty.

I21Notwithstanding these gains, much more must be done. The resilience of the international drug trade remains grimly impressive_current estimates suggest that we still intercept only a small fraction of all the heroin and cocaine entering this country. Local police still find that more than one of every three suspects arrested for street crimes is a narcotic abuser or addict. And the total number of Americans addicted to narcotics, suffering terribly themselves and inflicting their suffering in countless others, still stands in the hundreds of thousands.

I71A UNIFIED COMMAND FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT

I21Seeking ways to intensify our counter-offensive against this menace, I am asking the Congress today to join with this Administration in strengthening and streamlining the Federal drug law enforcement effort.

I21Funding for this effort has increased sevenfold during the past five years, from $36 million in fiscal year 1969 to $257 million in fiscal year 1974_more money is not the most pressing enforcement need at present. Nor is there a primary need for more manpower working on the problem, over 2100 new agents having already been added to the Federal drug enforcement agencies under this Administration, an increase of more than 250 percent over the 1969 level.

I21The enforcement work could benefit significantly, however, from consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified command. Right now the Federal Government is fighting the war on drug abuse under a distinct handicap, for its efforts are those of a loosely confederated alliance facing a resourceful, elusive, worldwide enemy. Admiral Mahan, the master naval strategist, described this handicap precisely when he wrote that ``Granting the same aggregate of force, it is never as great in two hands as in one, because it is not perfectly concentrated.''

I21More specifically, the drug law enforcement activities of the United States now are not merely in two hands but in half a dozen. Within the Department of Justice, with no overall direction below the level of the Attorney General, these fragmented forces include the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence, and certain activities of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. The Treasury Department is also heavily engaged in enforcement work through the Bureau of Customs.

I21This aggregation of Federal activities has grown up rapidly over the past few years in response to the urgent need for stronger anti-drug measures. It has enabled us to make a very encouraging beginning in the accelerated drug enforcement drive of this Administration.

I21But it also has serious operational and organizational shortcomings. Certainly the cold-blooded underworld networks that funnel narcotics from suppliers all over the world into the veins of American drug victims are no respecters of the bureaucratic dividing lines that now complicate our anti-drug efforts. On the contrary, these modern-day slave traders can derive only advantage from the limitations of the existing organizational patchwork. Experience has now given us a good basis for correcting those limitations, and it is time to do so.

I21I therefore propose creation of a single, comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to lead the war against illicit drug traffic.

I21Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, which I am transmitting to the Congress with this message, would establish such an agency, to be called the Drug Enforcement Administration. It would be headed by an Administrator reporting directly to the Attorney General.

I21The Drug Enforcement Administration would carry out the following anti-drug functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets:

I34_All functions of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (which would be abolished as a separate entity by the reorganization plan);

I34_Those functions of the Bureau of Customs pertaining to drug investigations and intelligence (to be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General by the reorganization plan).

I34_All functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement; and

I34_All functions of the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence.

I21Merger of the latter two organizations into the new agency would be effected by an executive order dissolving them and transferring their functions, to take effect upon approval of Reorganization Plan No. 2 by the Congress. Drug law enforcement research currently funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and other agencies would also be transferred to the new agency by executive action.

I21The major responsibility of the Drug Enforcement Administration would thus include:

I34_development of overall Federal drug law enforcement strategy, programs, planning, and evaluation;

I34_full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects for violations under all Federal drug trafficking laws;

I34_full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects connected with illicit drugs seized at U.S. ports-of-entry and international borders;

I34_conduct of all relations with drug law enforcement officials of foreign governments, under the policy guidance of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control;

I34_full coordination and cooperation with State and local law enforcement officials on joint drug enforcement efforts; and

I34_regulation of the legal manufacture of drugs and other controlled substances under Federal regulations.

I21The Attorney General, working closely with the Administrator of this new agency, would have authority to make needed program adjustments. He would take steps within the Department of Justice to ensure that high priority emphasis is placed on the prosecution and sentencing of drug traffickers following their apprehension by the enforcement organization. He would also have the authority and responsibility for securing the fullest possible cooperation-particularly with respect to collection of drug intelligence_from all Federal departments and agencies which can contribute to the anti-drug work, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I21My proposals would make possible a more effective antidrug role for the FBI, especially in dealing with the relationship between drug trafficking and organized crime. I intend to see that the resources of the FBI are fully committed to assist in supporting the new Drug Enforcement Administration.

I21The consolidation effected under Reorganization Plan No. 2 would reinforce the basic law enforcement and criminal justice mission of the Department of Justice. With worldwide drug law enforcement responsibilities no longer divided among several organizations in two different Cabinet departments, more complete and cumulative drug law enforcement intelligence could be compiled. Patterns of international and domestic illicit drug production, distribution, and sale could be more directly compared and interpreted. Case-by-case drug law enforcement activities could be more comprehensively linked, cross-referenced, and coordinated into a single, organic enforcement operation. In short, drug law enforcement officers would be able to spend more time going after the traffickers and less time coordinating with one another.

I21Such progress could be especially helpful on the international front. Narcotics control action plans, developed under the leadership of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, are now being carried out by U.S. officials in cooperation with host governments in 59 countries around the world. This wide-ranging effort to cut off drug supplies before they ever reach U.S. borders or streets is just now beginning to bear fruit. We can enhance its effectiveness, with little disruption of ongoing enforcement activities, by merging both the highly effective narcotics force of overseas Customs agents and the rapidly developing international activities of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs into the Drug Enforcement Administration. The new agency would work closely with the Cabinet Committee under the active leadership of the U.S. Ambassador in each country where anti-drug programs are underway.

I21Two years ago, when I established the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention within the Executive Office of the President, we gained an organization with the necessary resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to begin dealing decisively with the ``demand'' side of the drug abuse problem_treatment and rehabilitation for those who have been drug victims, and preventive programs for potential drug abusers. This year, by permitting my reorganization proposals to take effect, the Congress can help provide a similar capability on the ``supply'' side. The proposed Drug Enforcement Administration, working as a team with the Special Action Office, would arm Americans with a potent one-two punch to help us fight back against the deadly menace of drug abuse. I ask full Congressional cooperation in its establishment.

I71IMPROVING PORT-OF-ENTRY INSPECTIONS

I21No heroin or cocaine is produced within the United States; domestic availability of these substances results solely from their illegal importation. The careful and complete inspection of all persons and goods coming into the United States is therefore an integral part of effective Federal drug law enforcement.

I21At the present time, however, Federal responsibility for conducting port-of-entry inspections is awkwardly divided among several Cabinet departments. The principal agencies involved are the Treasury Department's Bureau of Customs, which inspects goods, and the Justice Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service, which inspects persons and their papers. The two utilize separate inspection procedures, hold differing views of inspection priorities, and employ dissimilar personnel management practices.

I21To reduce the possibility that illicit drugs will escape detection at ports-of-entry because of divided responsibility, and to enhance the effectiveness of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the reorganization plan which I am proposing today would transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury all functions currently vested in Justice Department officials to inspect persons, or the documents of persons.

I21When the plan takes effect, it is my intention to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to use the resources so transferred_including some 1,000 employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service_to augment the staff and budget of the Bureau of Customs. The Bureau's primary responsibilities would then include:

I34_inspection of all persons and goods entering the United States;

I34_valuation of goods being imported, and assessment of appropriate tariff duties;

I34_interception of contraband being smuggled into the United States;

I34_enforcement of U.S. laws governing the international movement of goods, except the investigation of contraband drugs and narcotics; and

I34_turning over the investigation responsibility for all drug law enforcement cases to the Department of Justice.

I21The reorganization would thus group most port-of-entry inspection functions in a single Cabinet department. It would reduce the need for much day-to-day interdepartmental coordination, allow more efficient staffing at some field locations, and remove the basis for damaging interagency rivalries. It would also give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority and flexibility to meet changing requirements in inspecting the international flow of people and goods. An important by-product of the change would be more convenient service for travellers entering and leaving the country.

I21For these reasons, I am convinced that inspection activities at U.S. ports-of-entry can more effectively support our drug law enforcement efforts if concentrated in a single agency. The processing of persons at ports-of-entry is too closely interrelated with the inspection of goods to remain organizationally separated from it any longer. Both types of inspections have numerous objectives besides drug law enforcement, so it is logical to vest them in the Treasury Department, which has long had the principal responsibility for port-of-entry inspection of goods, including goods being transported in connection with persons. As long as the inspections are conducted with full awareness of related drug concerns it is neither necessary nor desirable that they be made a responsibility of the primary drug enforcement organization.

I71DECLARATIONS

I21After investigation, I have found that each action included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive of the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1): ``to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;'' Section 901(a)(3): ``to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;'' Section 901(a)(5) ``to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government;'' and Section 901(a)(6): ``to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.''

I21As required by law, the plan has one logically consistent subject matter: consolidation of Federal drug law enforcement activities in a manner designed to increase their effectiveness.

I21The plan would establish in the Department of Justice a new Administration designated as the Drug Enforcement Administration. The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in Section 5 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.

I21While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which may result from the actions proposed, some savings may be anticipated in administrative costs now associated with the functions being transferred and consolidated.

I21The proposed reorganization is a necessary step in upgrading the effectiveness of our Nation's drug law enforcement effort. Both of the proposed changes would build on the strengths of established agencies, yielding maximum gains in the battle against drug abuse with minimum loss of time and momentum in the transition.

I21I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.

I21Sections 187 and 364 of the Revised Statutes are combined into one section since they both deal with the same subject matter and are derived from the Act of Feb. 14, 1871, ch. 51, ÿ1A3, 16 Stat. 412.

I21The words ``executive department'' are substituted for ``Department'' because ``Department'', as used in R.S. ÿ1A187 and 364, meant ``executive department''. (See R.S. ÿ1A159.) The word ``agency'' is substituted for ``bureau'' as it has a more common current acceptance. The word ``concerning'' is substituted for ``touching''. Reference to application for a subpena is omitted as R.S. ÿ1A364 gives the department head the same authority to request aid from the Attorney General whether or not application has been made for a subpena.

I21Section 187 of the Revised Statutes was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, ÿ1A201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, ÿ1A4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171ÿ091), which provides ``Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense'' is omitted from this title but is not repealed.

I11(b) Each attorney specially retained under authority of the Department of Justice shall be commissioned as special assistant to the Attorney General or special attorney, and shall take the oath required by law. Foreign counsel employed in special cases are not required to take the oath. The Attorney General shall fix the annual salary of a special assistant or special attorney.

I21The section is revised to express the effect of the law. As agency heads have long employed, with the approval of Congress, attorneys to advise them in the conduct of their official duties, the first 56 words of R.S. ÿ1A361 and of former section 306 of title 5 are omitted as obsolete.

I21The section concentrates the authority for the conduct of litigation in the Department of Justice. The words ``Except as otherwise authorized by law,'' are added to provide for existing and future exceptions (e.g., section 1037 of title 10). The words ``an agency'' are added for clarity and to align this section with section 519 which is of similar import. The words ``as such officer'' are omitted as unnecessary since it is implied that the officer is a party in his official capacity as an officer.

I21So much as prohibits the employment of counsel, other than in the Department of Justice, to conduct litigation is omitted as covered by R.S. ÿ1A365, which is codified in section 3106 of title 5, United States Code.

I86Ex. Ord. No. T112988K. Civil Justice Reform

I21Ex. Ord. No. 12988, Feb. 5, 1996, 61 F.R. 4729, provided:

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to improve access to justice for all persons who wish to avail themselves of court and administrative adjudicatory tribunals to resolve disputes, to facilitate the just and efficient resolution of civil claims involving the United States Government, to encourage the filing of only meritorious civil claims, to improve legislative and regulatory drafting to reduce needless litigation, to promote fair and prompt adjudication before administrative tribunals, and to provide a model for similar reforms of litigation practices in the private sector and in various states, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3Guidelines to Promote Just and Efficient Government Civil LitigationK. To promote the just and efficient resolution of civil claims, those Federal agencies and litigation counsel that conduct or otherwise participate in civil litigation on behalf of the United States Government in Federal court shall respect and adhere to the following guidelines during the conduct of such litigation:

I21(a) T3Pre-filing Notice of a ComplaintK. No litigation counsel shall file a complaint initiating civil litigation without first making a reasonable effort to notify all disputants about the nature of the dispute and to attempt to achieve a settlement, or confirming that the referring agency that previously handled the dispute has made a reasonable effort to notify the disputants and to achieve a settlement or has used its conciliation processes.

I21(b) T3Settlement ConferencesK. As soon as practicable after ascertaining the nature of a dispute in litigation, and throughout the litigation, litigation counsel shall evaluate settlement possibilities and make reasonable efforts to settle the litigation. Such efforts shall include offering to participate in a settlement conference or moving the court for a conference pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C. App.] in an attempt to resolve the dispute without additional civil litigation.

I21(c) T3Alternative Methods of Resolving the Dispute in LitigationK. Litigation counsel shall make reasonable attempts to resolve a dispute expeditiously and properly before proceeding to trial.

I21(1) Whenever feasible, claims should be resolved through informal discussions, negotiations, and settlements rather than through utilization of any formal court proceeding. Where the benefits of Alternative Dispute Resolution (``ADR'') may be derived, and after consultation with the agency referring the matter, litigation counsel should suggest the use of an appropriate ADR technique to the parties.

I21(2) It is appropriate to use ADR techniques or processes to resolve claims of or against the United States or its agencies, after litigation counsel determines that the use of a particular technique is warranted in the context of a particular claim or claims, and that such use will materially contribute to the prompt, fair, and efficient resolution of the claims.

I21(3) To facilitate broader and effective use of informal and formal ADR methods, litigation counsel should be trained in ADR techniques.

I21(d) T3DiscoveryK. To the extent practical, litigation counsel shall make every reasonable effort to streamline and expedite discovery in cases under counsel's supervision and control.

I21(1) T3Review of Proposed Document RequestsK. Each agency within the executive branch shall establish a coordinated procedure for the conduct and review of document discovery undertaken in litigation directly by that agency when that agency is litigation counsel. The procedure shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, review by a senior lawyer prior to service or filing of the request in litigation to determine that the request is not cumulative or duplicative, unreasonable, oppressive, unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the requirements of the litigation, the amount in controversy, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and whether the documents can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.

I21(2) T3Discovery MotionsK. Before petitioning a court to resolve a discovery motion or petitioning a court to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, litigation counsel shall attempt to resolve the dispute with opposing counsel. If litigation counsel makes a discovery motion concerning the dispute, he or she shall represent in that motion that any attempt at resolution was unsuccessful or impracticable under the circumstances.

I21(e) T3SanctionsK. Litigation counsel shall take steps to seek sanctions against opposing counsel and opposing parties where appropriate.

I21(1) Litigation counsel shall evaluate filings made by opposing parties and, where appropriate, shall petition the court to impose sanctions against those responsible for abusive practices.

I21(2) Prior to filing a motion for sanctions, litigation counsel shall submit the motion for review to the sanctions officer, or his or her designee, within the litigation counsel's agency. Such officer or designee shall be a senior supervising attorney within the agency, and shall be licensed to practice law before a State court, courts of the District of Columbia, or courts of any territory or Commonwealth of the United States.

I21(1) making reasonable efforts to negotiate with other parties about, and stipulate to, facts that are not in dispute;

I21(2) reviewing and revising pleadings and other filings to ensure that they are accurate and that they reflect a narrowing of issues, if any, that has resulted from discovery;

I21(3) requesting early trial dates where practicable;

I21(4) moving for summary judgment in every case where the movant would be likely to prevail, or where the motion is likely to narrow the issues to be tried; and

I21T4SecK. 3. T3Principles to Enact Legislation and Promulgate Regulations Which Do Not Unduly Burden the Federal Court System.

I21(a) T3General Duty to Review Legislation and RegulationsK. Within current budgetary constraints and existing executive branch coordination mechanisms and procedures established in OMB Circular A-19 and Executive Order No. 12866 [5 U.S.C. 601 note], each agency promulgating new regulations, reviewing existing regulations, developing legislative proposals concerning regulations, and developing new legislation shall adhere to the following requirements:

I21(1) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be reviewed by the agency to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguity;

I21(2) The agency's proposed legislation and regulations shall be written to minimize litigation; and

I21(b) T3Specific Issues for ReviewK. In conducting the reviews required by subsection (a), each agency formulating proposed legislation and regulations shall make every reasonable effort to ensure:

I21(1) that the legislation, as appropriate_

I21(B) specifies in clear language the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the law;

I21(C) specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal law, if any, including all provisions repealed, circumscribed, displaced, impaired, or modified;

I21(D) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct;

I21(E) specifies whether private arbitration and other forms of private dispute resolution are appropriate under enforcement and relief provisions; subject to constitutional requirements;

I21(F) specifies whether the provisions of the law are severable if one or more of them is found to be unconstitutional;

I21(G) specifies in clear language the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the law;

I21(I) specifies in clear language whether it grants private parties a right to sue and, if so, the relief available and the conditions and terms for authorized awards of attorney's fees, if any;

I21(J) specifies whether State courts have jurisdiction under the law and, if so, whether and under what conditions an action would be removable to Federal court;

I21(K) specifies whether administrative proceedings are to be required before parties may file suit in court and, if so, describes those proceedings and requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies;

I21(L) sets forth the standards governing the assertion of personal jurisdiction, if any;

I21(M) defines key statutory terms, either explicitly or by reference to other statutes that explicitly define those terms;

I21(N) specifies whether the legislation applies to the Federal Government or its agencies;

I21(O) specifies whether the legislation applies to States, territories, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and of the Northern Mariana Islands;

I21(P) specifies what remedies are available such as money damages, civil penalties, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees; and

I21(Q) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of legislation set forth by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') and after consultation with affected agencies, that are determined to be in accordance with the purposes of this order.

I21(2) that the regulation, as appropriate_

I21(A) specifies in clear language the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation;

I21(B) specifies in clear language the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed, circumscribed, displaced, impaired, or modified;

I21(C) provides a clear legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while promoting simplification and burden reduction;

I21(D) specifies in clear language the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation;

I21(E) specifies whether administrative proceedings are to be required before parties may file suit in court and, if so, describes those proceedings and requires the exhaustion of administrative remedies;

I21(F) defines key terms, either explicitly or by reference to other regulations or statutes that explicitly define those items; and

I21(G) addresses other important issues affecting clarity and general draftsmanship of regulations set forth by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the Director of OMB and after consultation with affected agencies, that are determined to be in accordance with the purposes of this order.

I21(c) T3Agency ReviewK. The agencies shall review such draft legislation or regulation to determine that either the draft legislation or regulation meets the applicable standards provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or it is unreasonable to require the particular piece of draft legislation or regulation to meet one or more of those standards.

I21T4SecK. 4. T3Principles to Promote Just and Efficient Administrative Adjudications.

I21(a) T3Implementation of Administrative Conference RecommendationsK.

I21(b) T3Improvements in Administrative AdjudicationK. All Federal agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes and develop specific procedures to reduce delay in decision-making, to facilitate self-representation where appropriate, to expand non-lawyer counseling and representation where appropriate, and to invest maximum discretion in fact-finding officers to encourage appropriate settlement of claims as early as possible.

I21(c) T3BiasK. All Federal agencies should review their administrative adjudicatory processes to identify any type of bias on the part of the decision-makers that results in an injustice to persons who appear before administrative adjudicatory tribunals; regularly train all fact-finders, administrative law judges, and other decision-makers to eliminate such bias; and establish appropriate mechanisms to receive and resolve complaints of such bias from persons who appear before administrative adjudicatory tribunals.

I21(d) T3Public EducationK. All Federal agencies should develop effective and simple methods, including the use of electronic technology, to educate the public about its claims/benefits policies and procedures.

I21(a) The term ``agency'' shall be defined as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code.

I21(b) The term ``litigation counsel'' shall be defined as the trial counsel or the office in which such trial counsel is employed, such as the United States Attorney's Office for the district in which the litigation is pending or a litigating division of the Department of Justice. Special Assistant United States Attorneys are included within this definition. Those agencies authorized by law to represent themselves in court without assistance from the Department of Justice are also included in this definition, as are private counsel hired by any Federal agency to conduct litigation on behalf of the agency or the United States.

I21T4SecK. 7. T3No Private Rights CreatedK. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch in resolving disputes, conducting litigation in a reasonable and just manner, and reviewing legislation and regulations. This order shall not be construed as creating any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person. This order shall not be construed to create any right to judicial review involving the compliance or noncompliance of the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person with this order. Nothing in this order shall be construed to obligate the United States to accept a particular settlement or resolution of a dispute, to alter its standards for accepting settlements, to forego seeking a consent decree or other relief, or to alter any existing delegation of settlement or litigating authority.

I21T4SecK. 8. T3Scope.

I21(a) T3No Applicability to Criminal Matters or Proceedings in Foreign CourtsK. This order is applicable to civil matters only. It is not intended to affect criminal matters, including enforcement of criminal fines or judgments of criminal forfeiture. This order does not apply to litigation brought by or against the United States in foreign courts or tribunals.

I21(b) T3Application of Notice ProvisionK. Notice pursuant to subsection (a) of section 1 is not required (1) in any action to seize or forfeit assets subject to forfeiture or in any action to seize property; (2) in any bankruptcy, insolvency, conservatorship, receivership, or liquidation proceeding; (3) when the assets that are the subject of the action or that would satisfy the judgment are subject to flight, dissipation, or destruction; (4) when the defendant is subject to flight; (5) when, as determined by litigation counsel, exigent circumstances make providing such notice impracticable or such notice would otherwise defeat the purpose of the litigation, such as in actions seeking temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctive relief; or (6) in those limited classes of cases where the Attorney General determines that providing such notice would defeat the purpose of the litigation.

I21(c) T3Additional Guidance as to ScopeK. The Attorney General shall have the authority to issue further guidance as to the scope of this order, except section 3, consistent with the purposes of this order.

I21T4SecK. 9. T3Conflicts with Other RulesK. Nothing in this order shall be construed to require litigation counsel or any agency to act in a manner contrary to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [28 U.S.C. App.], Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure, State or Federal law, other applicable rules of practice or procedure, or court order.

I21T4SecK. 10. T3Privileged InformationK. Nothing in this order shall compel or authorize the disclosure of privileged information, sensitive law enforcement information, information affecting national security, or information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law.

I11(b) Within a reasonable time after receipt of the request from the Attorney General, the executive department, military department, bureau, or officer shall furnish the Attorney General with a written statement of all facts, information, and proofs. The statement shall contain a reference to or description of all official documents and papers, if any, as may furnish proof of facts referred to in it, or may be necessary and proper for the defense of the United States against the claim, mentioning the department, office, or place where the same is kept or may be secured. If the claim has been passed on and decided by the department, bureau, or officer, the statement shall briefly state the reasons and principles on which the decision was based.

I21In subsection (a), the word ``concerning'' is substituted for ``touching''.

I21The words ``executive department'' are substituted for ``department'' because ``department'' as used in R.S. ÿ1A188 meant ``executive department''. (See R.S. ÿ1A159.) The words ``military department'' are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301 of title 5, United States Code.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21The section is supplied for convenience and clarification. The Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice, the earliest predecessor agency of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was created administratively in 1908. It appears that funds used for the Bureau of Investigation were first obtained through the Department of Justice Appropriation Act of May 22, 1908, ch. 186, ÿ1A1 (par. beginning ``From the appropriations for the prosecution of crimes''), 35 Stat. 236, although that statutory provision makes no express mention of the Bureau or of the investigative function.

I21Section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, specifically recognized the Bureau of Investigation in the Department of Justice and provided that all that Bureau's functions together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition were ``transferred to and consolidated in a Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation.''

I21The Division of Investigation was first designated as the ``Federal Bureau of Investigation'' by the Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39, title II, 49 Stat. 77, and has been so designated in statutes since that date.

I85Transfer of Functions

I21For transfer of functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including the functions of the Attorney General relating thereto, to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and for treatment of related references, see former section 313(3) and sections 121(g)(1), 551(d), 552(d), and 557 of Title 6, Domestic Security, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002, as modified, set out as a note under section 542 of Title 6.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21The section is supplied for convenience and clarification and is based on section 3 of Executive Order No. 6166 of June 10, 1933, which provided for the transfer of the functions of the Bureau of Investigation together with the investigative functions of the Bureau of Prohibition to a ``Division of Investigation in the Department of Justice, at the head of which shall be a Director of Investigation''. The Division of Investigation was first designated as the ``Federal Bureau of Investigation'' by the Act of Mar. 22, 1935, ch. 39, title II, 49 Stat. 77, and has been so designated in statutes since that date. The title of ``Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation'' was recognized by statute in the Act of June 5, 1936, ch. 529, 49 Stat. 1484, and has been used in statutes since that date.

e

I21The section is from the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1965. Similar provisions were contained in each appropriation Act for the Department running back to 1921, which Acts are identified in a note under sections 299 and 300 of title 5, U.S.C. 1964 ed.

I21The section is reorganized for clarity. The authority to appoint officials for the cited purposes is implied. The word ``may'' is substituted for ``is authorized to''. The words ``who shall be vested with the authority necessary for the execution of such duties'' are omitted as unnecessary as the appointment of the officials for the purposes indicated carries with it the authority necessary to perform their duties.

I21In paragraph (2), the words ``to assist in'' are added for clarity and in recognition of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3056 which vest in the United States Secret Service the responsibility for the protection of the person of the President. As so revised, this paragraph will assure that the Secret Service will continue to have primary responsibility for the protection of the President but at the same time will permit the Federal Bureau of Investigation to render assistance in such protection.

I21The last sentence is added because in various areas the authority to investigate certain criminal offenses has been specifically assigned by statute to departments and agencies other than the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For example, the enforcement of the internal revenue laws is specifically a function of the Secretary of the Treasury and he is authorized to employ such number of persons as he deems proper for the enforcement of such laws (26 U.S.C. 7801, 7803). The Secretary of the Treasury is specifically authorized to direct the collection of duties on imports and to appoint such employees for that purpose as he deems necessary (19 U.S.C. 3, 6). The U.S. Coast Guard is specifically authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing the Federal laws upon the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (14 U.S.C. 2). Subject to the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secret Service is specifically authorized to detect and arrest persons committing offenses against the laws of the United States relating to coins and obligations and securities of the United States and foreign governments (18 U.S.C. 3056).

I21Section consolidates section 481 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11ÿ091001 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., with parts of sections 643 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of United States attorneys.

I21The term ``United States attorney'' was adopted in this section for ``attorney for the United States.'' Since the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in In re Neagle, 1890 (10 S. Ct. 658, 135 U.S. 1, 34, L. Ed. 55) where the terms ``attorneys of the United States'' and ``district attorneys'' were used interchangeably, Congress has also designated such officers as either ``United States attorneys'' or as ``district attorneys.'' See Acts of Feb. 22, 1886, ch. 928, ÿ1A7, 24 Stat. 309; July 3, 1890, ch. 656, ÿ1A16, 26 Stat. 217; July 10, 1890, ch. 664, ÿ1A16, 26 Stat. 225, and Acts of July 20, 1882, ch. 312, ÿ1A3, 22 Stat. 172; Mar. 3, 1915, ch. 100, ÿ1A3, 38 Stat. 961; May 28, 1926, ch. 414, ÿ1A2(b), 44 Stat. 672.

I21At present, such officers are invariably designated as ``United States attorneys'' by Federal courts and the Department of Justice.

I21Words ``The President may appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,'' were inserted to conform section with the Constitution. See article II, section 2, clause 2.

I21Words ``including the District of Columbia'' were omitted, because the District is made a judicial district by section 88 of this title. District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., ÿ1A11ÿ091001, provided for appointment of an ``attorney of the United States for the District'' by the President, subject to Senate confirmation.

I21Words ``learned in the law'' were omitted as unnecessary. Such requirement is not made of United States judges and no reason appears to make a distinction respecting United States attorneys.

I21Parts of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., remain in said title 48. For remainder thereof, see Distribution Table. Other provisions of section 643 of such title are incorporated in sections 133, 504 [now 541 and 544], and 541 [see 561] of this title.

I21The provision as to the tenure of the assistant United States attorneys and special attorneys is new. Existing law contains no provision as to tenure or removal of such officials.

I21The provision permitting the United States attorney and his assistants to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few Federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein.

I21Use of ``revenue law'' in subsection (a)(4) in this section, which is based on section 486 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., obviates repetition of provisions relating to customs and revenue laws as both are covered by the term.

Section 6 did not, however, provide for the exception of United States attorneys as did former section 73.

I21Sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1949, which are codified in sections 5701 and 5702 of title 5, United States Code, defined the coverage of the Act and allowed for specific exclusions in the legislative and judicial branches but did not mention an exclusion in the executive branch for United States attorneys.

I21Section 7 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5707 of title 5, United States Code, expressly vested in the Director of the Bureau of the Budget the authority to prescribe regulations covering travel allowances and the reimbursement of travel expenses.

I21Section 8 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(1), (2) of title 5, United States Code, made specific exclusions from the coverage of the Act, and United States attorneys were not so excluded.

I21Section 9 of the 1949 Act, which is codified in section 5708(3), (4) of title 5, United States Code, modified acts inconsistent with the 1949 Act, and specifically mentioned acts which authorize reimbursement of ``actual and necessary'' expenses.

I21Section consolidates parts of sections 73 and 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and of sections 586, 587, and 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21First paragraph of this section is from section 587 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which did not apply to Alaska because of the restriction in section 591 of said title 28. However, the latter section has been superseded, in that respect, by subsequent appropriation acts, the latest being act July 5, 1946, ch. 541, title II, 60 Stat. 460, which specifically allows office expenses for United States attorneys in Alaska. This section applies to all United States attorneys.

I21Section 73 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., allowed only actual traveling expenses to Government employees, except ``district attorneys,'' marshals and clerks of courts and their deputies. It has been superseded by the Subsistence Expense Act of 1926. See sections 821 et seq. of said title 5.

I21References in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to absence ``from their respective official residences'' and to going to and returning from attendance before courts, etc., were omitted as surplusage and covered by the phrase ``on official business.'' Language relating to Standardized Government Travel Regulations was also omitted as the reference in this section is to the provision in the Subsistence Expense Act, supra, authorizing those regulations. Verification under oath provision was omitted as covered by section 553 [see Prior Provisions note for that section] of this title which simplifies procedure by requiring payment upon certification by the payee. The penal provisions of title 18 are ample protection against fraud and an oath alone is no deterrent.

I21The requirement in section 592 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the marshals should include such payments in their accounts for auditing and allowance, was omitted as unnecessary. See section 541 et seq. [now section 561 et seq.] of this title and section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Section 318 of title 5, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to supervise the accounts of ``district'' attorneys, marshals, clerks, and other court officers. The language of this section covers that requirement. The provision as to marshals is incorporated in section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.

I21Quarterly expense accounts were required of United States attorneys and marshals by section 586 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such provision is omitted as unnecessary in view of this section and section 547 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Further provisions of said section 586 that office expenses of United States attorneys, assistants, and marshals should be allowed under regulations of the Attorney General and verified under oath, are simplified by this section and section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title. Another provision that accounts therefor should be submitted to, examined by the district court and, when approved by the court then audited and allowed by law, was omitted. The power of the Attorney General is sufficient. The reference to audit and allowance was unnecessary as covered by section 71 et seq. of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance. Said section 586 applied also to marshals and deputies and those provisions are incorporated in section 550 [see Prior Provisions note under that section] of this title.

I21The exception in sections 586 and 591 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the former should not apply in Alaska was omitted as unnecessary. Section 114 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, requires travel expense accounts to be rendered and paid as in other districts.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I21Section 593 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerks and messengers in the office of United States attorney, southern district of New York. Section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to clerical assistants for all United States attorneys. It was not affected by section 678 of title 5 U.S.C. 1940 ed., Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, according to a Department of Justice interpretation.

I21Provision of said section 593 for office expenses of United States attorneys is covered by section 509 [now 549] of this title.

I21Said section 593 also required that payment of salaries of such clerks and messengers be made by the disbursing clerk of the Department of Justice. Under section 550 [see Prior Provisions note below] of this title the marshals will make such payments including the office expenses of United States attorneys.

I21The restriction that section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not apply to Alaska is omitted as unnecessary since section 109 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, authorizes employment of clerical assistants to United States attorneys in Alaska by the Attorney General.

I21The provision in such section 484 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the need for clerical assistants be certified by the district judge, was omitted as unnecessary. The need may be determined by the Attorney General.

I21For purposes of uniformity, all provisions of law governing the regulation and allowance of office, travel, and subsistence expenses of all officers and employees of the courts, except those provisions relating to Supreme Court officers and employees, are incorporated in subsection (a)(6)(7) of this section. Likewise the provisions respecting the compensation of court officers and employees, except those of the Supreme Court, are incorporated in subsection (a)(5). In each instance the power to fix and determine such salaries and expenses is transferred to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. This change is in conformity with the Administrative Office Act 1939 included in this chapter.

I21Compensation of bailiffs however is provided by sections 713 and 755 of this title and that of court reporters by section 753 of this title.

I21Salaries and travel expenses of Court of Claims Commissioners are covered by section 792 of this title.

I21The language ``and the lawful fees of United States Commissioners'' in subsection (a)(6) and ``the offices of the United States Commissioners'' in subsection (a)(9) is new. It conforms with sections 633, 636 and 639 of this title.

I21Subsection (a)(5)(7) covers the provisions of section 726ÿ091 and 726a of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which provided that probation officers' salaries should not be less than $1,800 nor more than $3,600 per annum and their traveling expenses should not exceed more than 4 cents per mile.

I21Words ``and officers and employees of the Administrative Office'' were added in subsection (a)(7) to expressly authorize travel and subsistence expenses of such officers and employees.

I21The power to fix such pay and allowances is transferred to the Director as above indicated, and conforms with the Administrative Office Act of 1939. For further explanation of the general supervision of probation officers, see reviser's note under section 3654, H. Rept. to accompany H.R. 3190 for revision of title 18, U.S.C.

I21Subsection (a)(8) covers the provisions of section 1131 of title 26, U.S.C. 1940 ed. Such section 1131 authorized the Tax Court, successor to the Board of Tax Appeals, to make expenditures for personal services, rent, law books, reference books, periodicals, and provided that all expenditures should be paid out of appropriations for the Tax Court, on itemized vouchers approved by the court.

I21Two references to ``officials and employees covered by this chapter'' were changed to ``clerical and administrative personnel,'' following the language of paragraph (a)(1), conferring general power to supervise such personnel as respects administrative matters.

I21Similar language was used in paragraph (b) instead of ``The clerks of the district courts, their deputies and assistants, and all other employees of said courts.''

I21The provisions of section 374b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., based on successive acts relating to classification and compensation of secretaries and law clerks were omitted as temporary and unnecessary in revision, in view of subsection (a)(5) of this section under which the salaries of all personnel are necessarily limited by current appropriation acts.

I21For increases in basic rates of compensation for other judicial officers and employees see, also, section 521 of Act June 30, 1945, ch. 212.

I21The designation ``senior circuit judges'' was changed to ``chief judges of the circuits'' in conformity with section 45 of this title.

I21Provisions of section 11ÿ09204 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., relating to appointment of clerk of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and deputy clerk, crier, and messenger thereof, and the provisions relating to accounting for fees, are incorporated in sections 711 and 713 of this title. Provisions of said section, requiring the clerk of such court to give bond, were omitted as covered by section 952 of this title. Provisions of said section, relating to regulation of clerk's fees by such court were omitted so as to render uniform the method of such regulation as prescribed by section 1913 of this title, and the provisions of said section, placing a maximum of five hundred dollars per year on the office expenditures of the clerk of such court, were omitted as inconsistent with this consolidated section.

I21For distribution of other provisions of sections on which this section is based, see Distribution Table.

I21Changes were made in phraseology and arrangement.

I74Senate Revision Amendments

I21By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated, therefore, as finally enacted, sections 1130(a)(b) and 1131 of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code [1940 ed.], did not constitute part of the source of this section. However, no change in the text of the section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I21As finally enacted, part of act July 9, 1947, ch. 211, title IV, 61 Stat. 304, 305, which was classified to title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A374b, became one of the sources of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I21Section consolidates section 526 and a portion of 527, both of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with provisions of sections 27, 66, 80e, 100, 117e, 129, 172, 198e, 204e, 256d, 395e, 403cÿ095, 403hÿ095, 404cÿ095 and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to appointment of United States commissioners. For other provisions of said sections see Distribution Table.

I21Some of the provisions of section 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions were retained in that title.

I21The provision of sections 395e, 403cÿ095, 404cÿ095, and 408m of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for appointment of the Park Commissioner in the Hawaii National Park, Shenandoah National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Mammoth Cave National Park and Isle Royale National Park upon ``the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior'' was omitted as inconsistent not only with other provisions of this title but with other statutes applicable to other national parks.

I21All such park commissioners are United States commissioners and the revision of these sections makes possible uniformity and consistency in administrative matters concerning such commissioners. (See, also, sections 604 and 634 of this title.)

I21Words ``the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts'' were substituted for ``Attorney General'' in section 526 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., in view of the general supervision by the Director over clerks and commissioners under section 601 et seq. of this title.

I21See, also, section 751 of this title prohibiting clerks from receiving compensation in another capacity.

I21Sections from title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., contained no tenure provisions.

I21Changes in phraseology were made.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21By Senate amendment, ``Big Bend'' and ``Crater Lake'' were inserted in subsection (a) of this section, and section 158a of title 16, U.S.C., which was derived from act May 15, 1947, ch. 55, ÿ1A1, 61 Stat. 91, accordingly became an additional source of this section, such Act being included in the schedule of repeals. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I21As finally enacted, act May 15, 1947, ch. 57, 61 Stat. 92, which amended section 403cÿ095 of title 16, U.S.C., became an additional source of this section and was accordingly included in the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I711949 T4Act

I21This amendment conforms the language of section 631(b) to the provisions of section 35 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended by the act of June 28, 1946 (ÿ1A3, 60 Stat. 324), that full-time referees in bankruptcy may not be appointed United States Commissioners.

I21This amendment also removes an ambiguity from section 631(b) by making it clear that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has power to establish maximum limits of compensation to be received for performing the combined offices of commissioner and clerk or deputy clerk. This was the intent of sections 631 and 751 of title 28. (See the fifteenth paragraph of the reviser's note to the latter section, H. Rept. No. 308, April 25, 1947, p. A90, to accompany H.R. 3214, 80th Cong.)

Such determinations shall take effect in each judicial district at such time as the district court for such judicial district shall determine, but in no event later than one year after they are promulgated.

I11(c) T4Changes in Number, Locations, and SalariesK._Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the conference may, from time to time, in the light of the recommendations of the Director, the district courts, and the councils, change the number, locations, and salaries of full-time and part-time magistrate judges, as the expeditious administration of justice may require.

The consent of the parties allows a magistrate judge designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection to direct the entry of a judgment of the district court in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A325, 326, 327, 541 and 542 (Feb. 22, 1875, ch. 95, ÿ1A2, 3, 18 Stat. 333; Mar. 3, 1883, ch. 143, 22 Stat. 631; Mar. 15, 1898, ch. 68, ÿ1A8, 30 Stat. 317; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A219, 220, 221, 291, 36 Stat. 1152, 1153, 1167; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, ÿ1A304, 42 Stat. 24).

I21This section consolidates sections 541 and 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with parts of sections 325, 326 and 327 of such title.

I21The provisions in said section 325 relating to appointment of a marshal and reporter are incorporated in sections 672 and 673 of this title.

I21The provisions in section 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to duties and liabilities of the clerk's deputies are incorporated in section 954 of this title.

I21The provision of section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a duly certified copy of the clerk's bond should be competent evidence in any court, is incorporated in section 1737 of this title.

I21The provision that the clerk shall be subject to removal by the Court is new. Section 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., contained a similar provision as to deputies, but fixed no term of office for the clerk and made no provision for his removal. The Supreme Court held, in 1839, that a district judge had power to remove his clerk at pleasure in absence of any law fixing the clerk's tenure. T3In re HennenK, 38 U.S. 230, 13 Pet. 230, 10 L.Ed. 138. (See, also T3Myers v. U.SK., 1926, 47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160.)

I21The provision in section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk's bond be not less than $5,000 and not more than $20,000 was omitted. The Supreme Court should have wide discretion in such administrative matters. (See Hearings before Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives, 78th Cong., 2d sess., on Judiciary Appropriation Bill for 1945, page 102.)

I21A provision of section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a renewed or augmented bond should be required upon the Attorney General's motion and after thirty days' notice was omitted. The manner of requiring such bond is left to the Court's discretion by the revised section.

I21A further provision of section 326 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the failure to furnish such renewed or augmented bond should vacate the clerk's office was omitted as unnecessary, since the clerk is removable by the Court under this section.

I21The references in section 541 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to return ``under oath'' to be made ``on the 1st day of January of each year, or thirty days thereafter'' and ``on a form prescribed by the Attorney General'', were omitted as fully covered by the revised language ``annual returns'' under ``regulations prescribed by the Court''. Verification seems unnecessary especially as clerks of the courts of appeals are not required to submit similar returns under oath (see section 711 of this title). ``Court'' was substituted for ``Attorney General'', since the latter's powers and functions in court administrative matters have been transferred to the Director of the Administration Office of the United States Courts. (See sections 604 and 607 of this title.) The Director, however, exercises no authority in Supreme Court matters.

I21Section 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided that the clerk ``shall not retain'', out of fees received, more than $6,000 annually above clerk hire and expenses; that the surplus should be paid into the Treasury. Such indirect and unusual provision is simplified in this section by providing that his salary shall be fixed by the Court. Such salary limitation is omitted as inconsistent with larger salaries paid other clerks of courts.

I21The provisions that the Court shall fix the compensation of deputy clerks, and that the clerk shall fix the compensation of assistants and messengers with the approval of the Chief Justice, are new. Current appropriation Acts providing that the compensation of officers and employees of the Supreme Court, other than clerk and reporter shall be fixed by the court, unnecessarily burden the court with administrative details. Provision for allowance and approval of payments of compensation and office expenses by the clerk upon allowance and approval by the Chief Justice, instead of by the Court, was inserted with the approval of the Judicial Conference Committee on Revision of the Judicial Code as not inconsistent with section 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21References in sections 541 and 542 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to certification of expenses by the justices and for audit and allowances by the General Accounting Office, were omitted as unnecessary in view of this section.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Amendments

I211972_Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 92ÿ09310 repealed subsec. (b) which related to bond of Clerk of Supreme Court.

I21Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 88ÿ09279 substituted ``moneys collected by him'' for ``emoluments of his office over and above his lawful disbursements''.

I11(a) The Supreme Court may appoint a marshal, who shall be subject to removal by the Court, and may fix his compensation.

I11(b) The marshal may, with the approval of the Chief Justice of the United States, appoint and fix the compensation of necessary assistants and other employees to attend the Court, and necessary custodial employees.

I12(6) Pay the salaries of the Chief Justice, associate justices, and all officers and employees of the Court and disburse other funds appropriated for disbursement, under the direction of the Chief Justice;

I12(7) Pay the expenses of printing briefs and travel expenses of attorneys in behalf of persons whose motions to appear in forma pauperis in the Supreme Court have been approved and when counsel have been appointed by the Supreme Court, upon vouchers certified by the clerk of the Court;

I21This section consolidates sections 332 and 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 325 of such title.

I21Provisions of section 325 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of clerk and marshal of the Supreme Court are incorporated in sections 671 and 672 of this title.

I21The provision as to tenure is new and is added to insure consistency with other revised sections relating to tenure of court officers.

I21The provisions of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., fixing the reporter's salary at $8,000 per annum were omitted and the Court given authority to fix the salary in conformity with sections 671 and 672 of this title relating to the clerk and the marshal.

I21Provisions of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for allowance of stationery, supplies, equipment, and office rent are omitted as obsolete. Offices are now provided in the Supreme Court building and supplies are furnished by the marshal.

I21The last sentence of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the payment of the reporter's expenses from appropriation for the Supreme Court, was omitted as surplusage.

I21The revised section makes specific the implied power to fix the compensation of the reporter's assistants.

I21The provision in section 332 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the Public Printer to do the printing referred to in such section, was omitted as unnecessary. (See section 111 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents.)

I21Authority for making an appropriation to carry into effect the provisions of this section relating to compensation and allowances of the reporter, compensation of his assistants, and preparation of the decisions of the Supreme Court for publication, is contained in section 336 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This section gives statutory recognition to the office of librarian. For many years the Court has appointed its librarian directly through the Chief Justice, rather than through the marshal. Other members of the library staff are appointed by the librarian, with the approval of the Chief Justice.

I21Under this section the marshal will not be required to certify to expenditures for some 2,000 books bought for the library each year but this will be the duty of the librarian.

I21Section is derived from Appropriation Acts for fiscal years cited in the credits. It was omitted from the 1934 and 1940 editions of the U.S. Code because it was considered to be probably of a temporary nature. This section is consistent with other provisions authorizing the appointment of similar personnel for circuit and district judges.

I21The 1942 appropriation act (July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 501) made provision for ``all other officers and employees, whose compensation shall be fixed by the Court, except as otherwise provided by law and who may be assigned by the Chief Justice to any office or work of the Court.''

I21The salary limitation of $3,600 was omitted and the Court authorized to fix law clerks' salaries. Current appropriation acts provide that salaries of the Court's officers and employees, except the clerk and reporter, shall be fixed by the Court.

I11(b) Whenever advance pamphlet installments and bound volumes of the Court's decisions are printed by a private printer, an adequate number of copies for distribution in accordance with the requirements of section 411 of this title and for sale to the public shall be provided and made available for these purposes in such manner and at such prices as may be determined from time to time by the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice of the United States, in lieu of compliance by the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents with the requirements of sections 411 and 412 of this title with respect to such copies. Pending distribution or sale, such copies shall be the property of the United States and shall be held in the custody of the marshal or such other person, organization, or agency, as the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice of the United States may designate.

I21This section consolidates provisions of section 11ÿ09401 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., sections 644 and 863 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, and title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., sections 6, 7, 8, 524, 557, 567, 568, and 569 relating to district court clerks. Other provisions of such sections 8 and 524 are incorporated in sections 505 [now 545], 541 [see 561], and 954 of this title and other provisions of such section 11ÿ09401 of the District of Columbia Code have been retained in such Code.

I21Words ``with the approval of the court'' were substituted for ``Attorney General.'' The power to approve appointment of court officers is more properly a judicial one. (See section 711 of this title.)

I21The provision in section 6 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk be appointed by the district judge or senior judge where there was more than one member of the court was changed and the power vested in the court.

I21The provisions of section 644 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to compensation of clerks and deputy clerks were omitted as covered by section 604 of this title. Other provisions of said section 644 are incorporated in section 753 of this title.

I21Provision for similar officers in Alaska, Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands is made by sections 106, 1349, and 1405y, respectively, of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed. A part of section 863 of said title 48, was retained in title 48. For remainder of such section, see Distribution Table.

I21Words in sections 6 and 7 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``Except as otherwise provided for by law,'' were omitted as obsolete and superfluous.

I21References in section 7 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk recommend appointment of deputies and clerical assistants were omitted as unnecessary.

I21The provision that each clerk shall be subject to removal by the court is new. No tenure was provided for by title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., but said title contained provisions that other clerks should hold office during the pleasure of the courts which appointed them, and that deputies should hold office during the pleasure of the clerks. The Supreme Court held, in 1839, that a judge of a district court could remove the clerk thereof at pleasure in absence of any law fixing the clerk's tenure. T3In re HennenK, 38 U.S. 230, 13 Pet. 230, 10 L.Ed. 138. (See also, T3Meyers v. U.SK., 47 S.Ct. 21, 272 U.S. 52, 71 L.Ed. 160.)

I21Words ``circuit or'' after ``Every clerk of the'' in section 524 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted because of the abolition of the circuit courts by act Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A289, 36 Stat. 1167, title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A430.

I21The provisions in section 524 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk shall give his personal attention to his official duties, and declaring his office vacant upon removal from his district or neglect of duty, were omitted as covered by the removal provision of this section.

I21The provision permitting the clerk of the district court for the District of Columbia to reside within twenty miles of the District of Columbia was added because of the relatively small and congested area of the District, as a result of which few federal officers are appointed from the District or reside therein.

I21The provision in subsection (b) of this section authorizing judges to designate the places for maintaining offices by the clerks was added because of many special provisions, in sections 141ÿ09196 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for the maintenance of offices by the clerks of the district courts at various particular places. These provisions have been omitted, on revision, as covered by the more general provisions of this section. For residence requirements of United States attorneys and marshals, see sections 505 [now 545] and 541 [see 561] of this title.

I21A provision that a breach of section 569 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., should be deemed a vacation of the offender's appointment, was omitted as covered by the removal provision of this section.

I21The provision of section 569 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., limiting the compensation of a clerk who is appointed United States commissioner, to $3,000 a year for both offices was omitted as obsolete. The proper adjustment of the compensation of such clerks is an administrative matter more appropriately regulated by the Director of the Administrative Office under the Supervision of the Judicial Conference of the United States. (See section 604 of this title.)

I21Reference in sections 557, 567 and 568 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to accounting by district court clerks in Alaska, were omitted as covered by sections 106 and 107 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to duties of those clerks.

I21References in sections 557 and 567 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to the clerk of the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia, were omitted as covered by words ``The clerk of each district court of the United States.''

I21As revised, this section is in harmony with the provisions in chapters 45 and 47 of this title relating to accounting by the clerk of the Supreme Court and clerks of the courts of appeals.

I21Provisions as to time and method of accounting and settlement of accounts were omitted as covered by chapter 41 of this title giving the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts supervision over such accounts, and of chapter 2, Audit and Settlement of Accounts, of title 31, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Money and Finance.

I21Provisions as to particular fees and moneys to be accounted for were omitted as covered by words ``all fees, costs and other moneys.'' Included in such provisions was a provision as to naturalization fees, but a later act, now appearing in section 742 of title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality, provided a different method of accounting and an exception expressly referring to such section was inserted in this section.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A5b and 128 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A118b, as added Feb. 17, 1936, ch. 75, 49 Stat. 1140; May 14, 1940, ch. 189, title IV, 54 Stat. 210; June 28, 1941, ch. 258, title IV, 55 Stat. 301; July 2, 1942, ch. 472, title IV, 56 Stat. 504).

I21This section consolidates provisions of sections 5b and 128 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of law clerks for district judges.

I21Words in section 128 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``but there shall not be appointed more than thirty-five of such law clerks during the first fiscal year of the enactment of this section'' were omitted as executed and obsolete. Words ``Thereafter such number in excess of thirty-five per year shall be limited by necessity of each case as hereinabove provided'' were also deleted as superseded by section 5b of said title and obsolete. The Director of the Administrative Office has expressed such views. Chief judge of the circuit was substituted for senior circuit judge to conform to section 44 of this title.

I21Provisions of section 128 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to salary, or compensation of such clerks are incorporated in section 604 of this title. (See reviser's note under that section.)

I21The provisions in section 5b of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that district judges shall not appoint more than three law clerks in any one circuit was not repeated in the Judiciary Appropriation Acts, 1944, 1945, and 1946, 57 Stat. 242, 58 Stat. 357, 59 Stat. 196, ch. 129. The Director of the Administrative Office for United States Courts advises that as a matter of fact, more than three law clerks are serving district judges in several of the circuits at the present time. Consequently the limitation is omitted from this section.

I21The provision for appointment of secretaries is new. Existing law fixes compensation of secretaries but makes no provision for their appointment. (See section 604 of this title and reviser's note thereunder.)

I21Minor changes were made in phraseology.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21As finally enacted, sections 374c and 374d of Title 28, U.S.C., 1946 ed., which were derived from act July 23, 1947, ch. 300, ÿ1A1, 2, 61 Stat. 409, were an additional source of this section. Hence, by Senate amendment, the section was changed to conform with such sections, and such act was included in the schedule of repeals. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I74Amendments

I211988_Pub. L. 100ÿ09702 inserted at end ``A law clerk appointed under this section shall be exempt from the provisions of subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, unless specifically included by the appointing judge or by local rule of court.''

I211959_Pub. L. 86ÿ09221 substituted provision permitting district judges to appoint necessary law clerks and secretaries subject to aggregate salary limitations for provisions permitting a district judge to appoint a secretary and also a law clerk upon certification of necessity by the chief judge of the circuit and permitting the chief judge of a district court having five or more district judges to appoint an assistant secretary.

I89. Reporters

I11(a) Each district court of the United States, the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, the District Court of Guam, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands shall appoint one or more court reporters.

I11The number of reporters shall be determined by the Judicial Conference of the United States.

I11The qualifications of such reporters shall be determined by standards formulated by the Judicial Conference. Each reporter shall take an oath faithfully to perform the duties of his office.

I11Each such court, with the approval of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, may appoint additional reporters for temporary service not exceeding three months, when there is more reporting work in the district than can be performed promptly by the authorized number of reporters and the urgency is so great as to render it impracticable to obtain the approval of the Judicial Conference.

I11If any such court and the Judicial Conference are of the opinion that it is in the public interest that the duties of reporter should be combined with those of any other employee of the court, the Judicial Conference may authorize such a combination and fix the salary for the performance of the duties combined.

I11(b) Each session of the court and every other proceeding designated by rule or order of the court or by one of the judges shall be recorded verbatim by shorthand, mechanical means, electronic sound recording, or any other method, subject to regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference and subject to the discretion and approval of the judge. The regulations promulgated pursuant to the preceding sentence shall prescribe the types of electronic sound recording or other means which may be used. Proceedings to be recorded under this section include (1) all proceedings in criminal cases had in open court; (2) all proceedings in other cases had in open court unless the parties with the approval of the judge shall agree specifically to the contrary; and (3) such other proceedings as a judge of the court may direct or as may be required by rule or order of court asÿ1A\1\N may be requested by any party to the proceeding.

I28N\1\ÿ1ASo in original. Probably should be ``or as''.

I11The reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall attach his official certificate to the original shorthand notes or other original records so taken and promptly file them with the clerk who shall preserve them in the public records of the court for not less than ten years.

I11The reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall transcribe and certify such parts of the record of proceedings as may be required by any rule or order of court, including all arraignments, pleas, and proceedings in connection with the imposition of sentence in criminal cases unless they have been recorded by electronic sound recording as provided in this subsection and the original records so taken have been certified by him and filed with the clerk as provided in this subsection. He shall also transcribe and certify such other parts of the record of proceedings as may be required by rule or order of court. Upon the request of any party to any proceeding which has been so recorded who has agreed to pay the fee therefor, or of a judge of the court, the reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall promptly transcribe the original records of the requested parts of the proceedings and attach to the transcript his official certificate, and deliver the same to the party or judge making the request.

I11The reporter or other designated individual shall promptly deliver to the clerk for the records of the court a certified copy of any transcript so made.

I11The transcript in any case certified by the reporter or other individual designated to produce the record shall be deemed prima facie a correct statement of the testimony taken and proceedings had. No transcripts of the proceedings of the court shall be considered as official except those made from the records certified by the reporter or other individual designated to produce the record.

I11The original notes or other original records and the copy of the transcript in the office of the clerk shall be open during office hours to inspection by any person without charge.

I11(c) The reporters shall be subject to the supervision of the appointing court and the Judicial Conference in the performance of their duties, including dealings with parties requesting transcripts.

I11(d) The Judicial Conference shall prescribe records which shall be maintained and reports which shall be filed by the reporters. Such records shall be inspected and audited in the same manner as the records and accounts of clerks of the district courts, and may include records showing:

I12(1) the quantity of transcripts prepared;

I12(2) the fees charged and the fees collected for transcripts;

I12(3) any expenses incurred by the reporters in connection with transcripts;

I12(4) the amount of time the reporters are in attendance upon the courts for the purpose of recording proceedings; and

I12(5) such other information as the Judicial Conference may require.

Q04

I11(e) Each reporter shall receive an annual salary to be fixed from time to time by the Judicial Conference of the United States. For the purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 and chapter 84 of such title, a reporter shall be considered a full-time employee during any pay period for which a reporter receives a salary at the annual salary rate fixed for a full-time reporter under the preceding sentence. All supplies shall be furnished by the reporter at his own expense.

I11(f) Each reporter may charge and collect fees for transcripts requested by the parties, including the United States, at rates prescribed by the court subject to the approval of the Judicial Conference. He shall not charge a fee for any copy of a transcript delivered to the clerk for the records of court. Fees for transcripts furnished in criminal proceedings to persons proceeding under the Criminal Justice Act (18 U.S.C. 3006A), or in habeas corpus proceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis, shall be paid by the United States out of moneys appropriated for those purposes. Fees for transcripts furnished in proceedings brought under section 2255 of this title to persons permitted to sue or appeal in forma pauperis shall be paid by the United States out of money appropriated for that purpose if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the suit or appeal is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented by the suit or appeal. Fees for transcripts furnished in other proceedings to persons permitted to appeal in forma pauperis shall also be paid by the United States if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal is not frivolous (but presents a substantial question). The reporter may require any party requesting a transcript to prepay the estimated fee in advance except as to transcripts that are to be paid for by the United States.

I11(g) If, upon the advice of the chief judge of any district court within the circuit, the judicial council of any circuit determines that the number of court reporters provided such district court pursuant to subsection (a) of this section is insufficient to meet temporary demands and needs and that the services of additional court reporters for such district court should be provided the judges of such district court (including the senior judges thereof when such senior judges are performing substantial judicial services for such court) on a contract basis, rather than by appointment of court reporters as otherwise provided in this section, and such judicial council notifies the Director of the Administrative Office, in writing, of such determination, the Director of the Administrative Office is authorized to and shall contract, without regard to section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41, with any suitable person, firm, association, or corporation for the providing of court reporters to serve such district court under such terms and conditions as the Director of the Administrative Office finds, after consultation with the chief judge of the district court, will best serve the needs of such district court.

I21The provisions of section 644 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, relating to clerks and deputy clerks, were incorporated in section 751 of this title. The provision of said section 644 fixing the salary of the reporter at $1,200 per annum was omitted as inconsistent with this section. Certain other provisions of said section 644 were also omitted. (See reviser's note under section 751 of this title.)

I21Words ``including the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia, and the district courts in the territories and insular possessions'' were omitted as covered by ``Each district court in the United States, the District Court for the Territory of Alaska, the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, and the District Court of the Virgin Islands.'' (See reviser's note under section 88 of this title.) The courts in Hawaii and Puerto Rico are district courts of the United States under definitive section 451 of this title.

I89. Receivers of property in different districts

I11A receiver appointed in any civil action or proceeding involving property, real, personal or mixed, situated in different districts shall, upon giving bond as required by the court, be vested with complete jurisdiction and control of all such property with the right to take possession thereof.

I11He shall have capacity to sue in any district without ancillary appointment, and may be sued with respect thereto as provided in section 959 of this title.

I11Such receiver shall, within ten days after the entry of his order of appointment, file copies of the complaint and such order of appointment in the district court for each district in which property is located. The failure to file such copies in any district shall divest the receiver of jurisdiction and control over all such property in that district.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 922.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A117 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A56, 36 Stat. 1102).

I21Word ``action'' was substituted for ``suit'', in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied to land or other property of a fixed character lying in different States within the same circuit. Words ``property, real, personal or mixed, situated in different districts'', were inserted to broaden the scope of this section to cover all property in different districts without respect to situs ``within different states within same judicial circuit''.

I21The revised section permits the receiver appointed by any district court to control all property of the defendant in whatever district the property is situated. The provisions of section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for divesting the receiver's jurisdiction and control of property in other districts upon disapproval by the circuit court of appeals or a judge thereof of the circuit embracing the district of appointment was omitted as unnecessary in view of sections 1292 and 2107 of this title. Said section 1292 provides for review of the order of appointment and the directions of the reviewing court will control the receiver.

I21Provisions of section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to process are the basis of section 1692 of this title.

I21Under section 117 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., failure to file copies of the complaint and order of appointment in any district where part of the property was located divested the receiver of jurisdiction over all the property except that part located in the State where the suit was brought. This has been changed by limiting the exception to the district where the copies are not filed. Obviously the election of the receiver not to take control of property in one district ought not to preclude his control in those districts in which he did file such copies.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I89. Criers and bailiffs

I11Each district judge may appoint a crier for the court in which he presides who shall perform also the duties of bailiff and messenger. A crier may perform also the duties of law clerk if he is qualified to do so and the district judge who appointed him designates him to serve as a crier-law clerk. A crier designated to serve as a crier-law clerk shall receive the compensation of a law clerk, but only so much of that compensation as is in excess of the compensation to which he would be entitled as a crier shall be deemed the compensation of a law clerk for the purposes of any limitation imposed by law upon the aggregate salaries of law clerks and secretaries appointed by a district judge.

I11Each United States marshal may employ, with the approval of the judge, not exceeding four bailiffs as the district judge may determine, to attend the court, maintain order, wait upon the grand and petit juries, and perform such other necessary duties as the judge or marshal may direct.

I11If the position of crier or bailiff is to be filled by the appointment of a person who has not previously served as either crier or bailiff, preference in the appointment shall be given to a person who has served in the military or naval forces of the United States in time of war and who has been honorably discharged therefrom, if in the opinion of the appointing officer such person is as well qualified as any other available person to perform to the satisfaction of the appointing officer all the duties of the position.

I21Section 289 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., required the Attorney General to duplicate the reporting to Congress of judgments which are furnished by the clerk. The revised section eliminates such duplication by requiring the clerk to transmit the information to Congress.

I21Section 512 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to the Clerk of the Supreme Court and clerks and deputies of the district courts.

I21This section is applicable to the Supreme Court and to all courts established by act of Congress.

I21The last sentence of section 512 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., reading ``The words `So help me God.' shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath,'' was omitted as unnecessary because on affirmation such words would not be included. As revised, the section conforms with section 453 of this title providing for the form of judicial oath.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A264, 523 and 525, section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code, and District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., ÿ1A11ÿ09402 (R.S. ÿ1A799; May 28, 1896, ch. 252, ÿ1A19, 29 Stat. 184; Mar. 2, 1901, ch. 814, 31 Stat. 956; Mar. 3, 1901, ch. 854, ÿ1A178, 31 Stat. 1219; June 30, 1902, ch. 1329, 32 Stat. 527; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A158, 291, 36 Stat. 1139, 1167; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, ÿ1A1114(a), 53 Stat. 160; Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 619, title V, ÿ1A504(a)(c), 56 Stat. 957; Feb. 25, 1944, ch. 63, title V, ÿ1A503, 58 Stat. 72).

I21This section consolidates a part of section 525, sections 264 and 523 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., part of section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., section 11ÿ09402 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed.,

I21As respects acknowledgments, sections 264, 523 and 525 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 11ÿ09402 of District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., referred only to the Court of Claims and the District Court for the District of Columbia. However, section 555 of said title 28, before amendment in 1944, provided for the collection of a fee by district court clerks for taking acknowledgments. The 1944 amendment provided for the fixing of fees by the Judicial Conference of the United States. If notaries and other minor officials may take acknowledgments there seems to be no reason why clerks of Federal courts and their deputies should not have such power.

I21Words ``Except as provided in section 591 of this title,'' in section 525 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted. Under such section 591, the provisions of such section 525 were inapplicable to the Territory of Alaska, but a later act of June 6, 1900, ch. 786, ÿ1A7, 31 Stat. 324, section 106 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions, provided that clerks of the District Court for Alaska should perform the duties required or authorized to be performed by clerks of United States courts in other districts.

I21Provisions of section 525 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to United States commissioners are incorporated in section 637 of this title.

I21Provisions of section 264 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 1114(a) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to administration of oaths and acknowledgments by judges, are incorporated in section 459 of this title. For distribution of other provisions of such section 1114(a) of title 26, see Distribution Table.

I21Changes in phraseology were made.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21Those provisions of this section which related to the Tax Court were eliminated by Senate amendment, therefore section 1114(a) of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, was not a part of the source of this section upon final enactment. The Senate amendments also eliminated section 1114(a) of the Internal Revenue Code from the schedule of repeals. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I89. Vacancy in clerk position; absence of clerk

I11When the office of clerk is vacant, the deputy clerks shall perform the duties of the clerk in the name of the last person who held that office. When the clerk is incapacitated, absent, or otherwise unavailable to perform official duties, the deputy clerks shall perform the duties of the clerk in the name of the clerk. The court may designate a deputy clerk to act temporarily as clerk of the court in his or her own name.

I21Section consolidates parts of sections 8, 222 and 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Sections 8, 222 and 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to district courts, courts of appeals and the Supreme Court, respectively. This section applies to all Federal courts and is in conformity with section 548 [546] of this title relating to death of a United States marshal.

I21The provision for continuance of the salary of the clerk of the Supreme Court until his successor is appointed and qualifies was inserted to preserve existing law as declared in the unpublished opinion of Chief Justice Taft, March 23, 1932 (filed in the Department of Justice), with respect to a deceased clerk of the Supreme Court.

I21Other provisions of sections 8, 222 and 327 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 671, 711, and 751 of this title.

I74Amendments

I211996_Pub. L. 104ÿ09317 substituted ``Vacancy in clerk position; absence of clerk'' for ``Death of clerk; duties of deputies'' in section catchline and amended text generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows:

I21``Upon the death of any clerk of court, his deputy or deputies shall execute the duties of the deceased clerk in his name until his successor is appointed and qualifies.

I21``The compensation of a deceased clerk of the Supreme Court may be paid to his personal representatives until his successor is appointed and qualifies.''

I211972_Pub. L. 92ÿ09310 struck out ``and remedies against'' before ``deputies'' in section catchline and repealed provisions which related to the default or misfeasance of a deputy in connection with the bond of a deceased clerk of a Federal court.

I21Sections 395 and 396 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., have been extended to include all clerks, deputies, and assistants.

I21This section is new insofar as it affects the Clerk of the Supreme Court and clerks of the district courts and the Customs Court.

I11(g) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1) to meet the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code, shall take into account the nature and capacity of the penal, correctional, and other facilities and services available, and shall make recommendations concerning any change or expansion in the nature or capacity of such facilities and services that might become necessary as a result of the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The sentencing guidelines prescribed under this chapter shall be formulated to minimize the likelihood that the Federal prison population will exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons, as determined by the Commission.

I11(h) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants in which the defendant is eighteen years old or older and_

I12(1) has been convicted of a felony that is_

I13(A) a crime of violence; or

I13(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and 959), and chapter 705 of title 46; and

Q04

I12(2) has previously been convicted of two or more prior felonies, each of which is_

I13(A) a crime of violence; or

I13(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and 959), and chapter 705 of title 46.

Q04

I11(i) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment for categories of defendants in which the defendant_

I12(1) has a history of two or more prior Federal, State, or local felony convictions for offenses committed on different occasions;

I12(2) committed the offense as part of a pattern of criminal conduct from which the defendant derived a substantial portion of the defendant's income;

I12(3) committed the offense in furtherance of a conspiracy with three or more persons engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity in which the defendant participated in a managerial or supervisory capacity;

I12(4) committed a crime of violence that constitutes a felony while on release pending trial, sentence, or appeal from a Federal, State, or local felony for which he was ultimately convicted; or

I12(5) committed a felony that is set forth in section 401 or 1010 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 841 and 960), and that involved trafficking in a substantial quantity of a controlled substance.

Q04

I11(j) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense, and the general appropriateness of imposing a term of imprisonment on a person convicted of a crime of violence that results in serious bodily injury.

I11(k) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.

I11(T3lK) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1) reflect_

I12(1) the appropriateness of imposing an incremental penalty for each offense in a case in which a defendant is convicted of_

I13(A) multiple offenses committed in the same course of conduct that result in the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over one or more of the offenses; and

I13(B) multiple offenses committed at different times, including those cases in which the subsequent offense is a violation of section 3146 (penalty for failure to appear) or is committed while the person is released pursuant to the provisions of section 3147 (penalty for an offense committed while on release) of title 18; and

Q04

I12(2) the general inappropriateness of imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense of conspiring to commit an offense or soliciting commission of an offense and for an offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation.

Q04

I11(m) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the fact that, in many cases, current sentences do not accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense. This will require that, as a starting point in its development of the initial sets of guidelines for particular categories of cases, the Commission ascertain the average sentences imposed in such categories of cases prior to the creation of the Commission, and in cases involving sentences to terms of imprisonment, the length of such terms actually served. The Commission shall not be bound by such average sentences, and shall independently develop a sentencing range that is consistent with the purposes of sentencing described in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.

I11(n) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.

I11(T3oK) The Commission periodically shall review and revise, in consideration of comments and data coming to its attention, the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section. In fulfilling its duties and in exercising its powers, the Commission shall consult with authorities on, and individual and institutional representatives of, various aspects of the Federal criminal justice system. The United States Probation System, the Bureau of Prisons, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice, and a representative of the Federal Public Defenders shall submit to the Commission any observations, comments, or questions pertinent to the work of the Commission whenever they believe such communication would be useful, and shall, at least annually, submit to the Commission a written report commenting on the operation of the Commission's guidelines, suggesting changes in the guidelines that appear to be warranted, and otherwise assessing the Commission's work.

I11(p) The Commission, at or after the beginning of a regular session of Congress, but not later than the first day of May, may promulgate under subsection (a) of this section and submit to Congress amendments to the guidelines and modifications to previously submitted amendments that have not taken effect, including modifications to the effective dates of such amendments. Such an amendment or modification shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor and shall take effect on a date specified by the Commission, which shall be no earlier than 180 days after being so submitted and no later than the first day of November of the calendar year in which the amendment or modification is submitted, except to the extent that the effective date is revised or the amendment is otherwise modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.

I11(q) The Commission and the Bureau of Prisons shall submit to Congress an analysis and recommendations concerning maximum utilization of resources to deal effectively with the Federal prison population. Such report shall be based upon consideration of a variety of alternatives, including_

I12(1) modernization of existing facilities;

I12(2) inmate classification and periodic review of such classification for use in placing inmates in the least restrictive facility necessary to ensure adequate security; and

I12(3) use of existing Federal facilities, such as those currently within military jurisdiction.

Q04

I11(r) The Commission, not later than two years after the initial set of sentencing guidelines promulgated under subsection (a) goes into effect, and thereafter whenever it finds it advisable, shall recommend to the Congress that it raise or lower the grades, or otherwise modify the maximum penalties, of those offenses for which such an adjustment appears appropriate.

I11(s) The Commission shall give due consideration to any petition filed by a defendant requesting modification of the guidelines utilized in the sentencing of such defendant, on the basis of changed circumstances unrelated to the defendant, including changes in_

I12(1) the community view of the gravity of the offense;

I12(2) the public concern generated by the offense; and

I12(3) the deterrent effect particular sentences may have on the commission of the offense by others.

Q04

I11(t) The Commission, in promulgating general policy statements regarding the sentencing modification provisions in section 3582(c)(1)(A) of title 18, shall describe what should be considered extraordinary and compelling reasons for sentence reduction, including the criteria to be applied and a list of specific examples. Rehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.

I11(u) If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.

I11(v) The Commission shall ensure that the general policy statements promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(2) include a policy limiting consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense involving a violation of a general prohibition and for an offense involving a violation of a specific prohibition encompassed within the general prohibition.

I11(w)(1) The Chief Judge of each district court shall ensure that, within 30 days following entry of judgment in every criminal case, the sentencing court submits to the Commission, in a format approved and required by the Commission, a written report of the sentence, the offense for which it is imposed, the age, race, sex of the offender, and information regarding factors made relevant by the guidelines. The report shall also include_

I12(A) the judgment and commitment order;

I12(B) the written statement of reasons for the sentence imposed (which shall include the reason for any departure from the otherwise applicable guideline range and which shall be stated on the written statement of reasons form issued by the Judicial Conference and approved by the United States Sentencing Commission);

I12(C) any plea agreement;

I12(D) the indictment or other charging document;

I12(E) the presentence report; and

I12(F) any other information as the Commission finds appropriate.

Q04

I10The information referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (F) shall be submitted by the sentencing court in a format approved and required by the Commission.

I11(2) The Commission shall, upon request, make available to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, the written reports and all underlying records accompanying those reports described in this section, as well as other records received from courts.

I11(3) The Commission shall submit to Congress at least annually an analysis of these documents, any recommendations for legislation that the Commission concludes is warranted by that analysis, and an accounting of those districts that the Commission believes have not submitted the appropriate information and documents required by this section.

I11(4) The Commission shall make available to the Attorney General, upon request, such data files as the Commission itself may assemble or maintain in electronic form as a result of the information submitted under paragraph (1). Such data files shall be made available in electronic form and shall include all data fields requested, including the identity of the sentencing judge.

I11(x) The provisions of section 553 of title 5, relating to publication in the Federal Register and public hearing procedure, shall apply to the promulgation of guidelines pursuant to this section.

I11(y) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), may include, as a component of a fine, the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation sentence that is ordered.

I74Definitions of Courts and Judges

I21``(a) All laws of the United States in force on September 1, 1948, in which reference is made to a `circuit court of appeals'; `senior circuit judge'; `senior district judge'; `presiding judge'; `chief justice', except when reference to the Chief Justice of the United States is intended; or `justice', except when used with respect to a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in his capacity as such or as a circuit justice, are hereby amended by substituting `court of appeals' for `circuit court of appeals'; `chief judge of the circuit' for `senior circuit judge'; `chief judge of the district court' for `senior district judge'; `chief judge' for `presiding judge'; `chief judge' for `chief justice', except when reference to the Chief Justice of the United States is intended; and `judge' for `justice', except when the latter term is used with respect to a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in his capacity as such or as a circuit justice.

I11(a) The Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States.

I12(3) All actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 927; Pub. L. 95ÿ09393, ÿ1A8(b), Sept. 30, 1978, 92 Stat. 810.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A341, 371(7), (8) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A233, 256, 36 Stat. 1156, 1160; Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 97, ÿ1A2, 40 Stat. 395; June 10, 1922, ch. 216, ÿ1A2, 42 Stat. 635).

I21This section reconciles provisions of sections 341 and 371(7), (8) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with Article 3, section 2 and Amendment 11 of the Constitution.

I21Sections 341 and 371 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were not wholly consistent with such constitutional provisions. Said section 341 provided that the Supreme Court should have original jurisdiction of controversies between a State and citizens of other States or aliens, whereas the 11th Amendment prohibits an action in any Federal Court against a State by citizens of another State or aliens.

I21The original jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 3, section 2, of the Constitution is not exclusive by virtue of that provision alone. Congress may provide for or deny exclusiveness. T3Ames v. KansasK, 1884, 4 S.Ct. 437, 111 U.S. 449, 28 L.Ed. 442; T3U.S. v. 4,450.72 Acres of Land, Clearwater County, State of MinnesotaK, D.C. Minn., 1939, 27 F.Supp. 167, affirmed 125 F.2d 636.

I21Sections 341 and 371 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., did not confer expressly exclusive jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in civil cases between States, T3Louisiana v. TexasK, 1899, 20 S.Ct. 251, 176 U.S. 1, 44 L.Ed. 347, as has been provided in subsection (a)(1) of the revised section. The language at the beginning of said section 341, for which said subsection has been substituted, was ambiguous and made it appear that an action by a State against the United States would be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, in T3U.S. v. LouisianaK, 1887, 8 S.Ct. 17, 123 U.S. 32, 31 L.Ed. 69, the Supreme Court, in a case appealed from the Court of Claims, held to the contrary.

I21So, also, in actions by the United States to condemn lands of a State or to enforce penalties for violation of a Federal statute against a State-owned utility, the United States district courts have jurisdiction. See T3United States v. State of UtahK, 1931, 51 S.Ct. 438, 283 U.S. 64, 75 L.Ed. 844; T3United States v. 4,450.72 Acres of Land, Clearwater County, State of MinnesotaK, D.C.Minn. 1939, 27 F.Supp. 167, affirmed 125 F.2d 636; T3United States v. State of CaliforniaK, 1936, 56 S.Ct. 421, 297 U.S. 175, 80 L.Ed. 567.

I21The intent of section 371(7), (8) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States should be exclusive of the courts of the States in controversies to which a State is a party, and suits against ambassadors, public ministers, consuls and vice consuls, is preserved and clarified by this section and section 1351 of this title.

I21The revised section preserves existing law with reference to foreign ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls. Under subsection (a)(2) the Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction of actions or proceedings against the ambassadors or public ministers of other nations.

I21Under subsection (b)(1) the Supreme Court has original but not exclusive jurisdiction of actions or proceedings brought by such ambassadors or other public ministers or to which consuls or vice consuls of other nations are parties.

I21Section 1351 of this title gives to United States district courts, exclusive of the courts of the States, jurisdiction of civil actions against such consuls and vice consuls.

I21This section and said section 1351 of this title have no application to ambassadors, public ministers, consuls or vice consuls representing the United States. See T3Milward v. McSaulK, D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1846, 17 Fed.Cas.No. 9,623 and T3State of Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. AlgerK, 1930, 50 S.Ct. 154, 280 U.S. 379, 74 L.Ed. 489.

I21Subsec. (b)(1). Pub. L. 95ÿ09393, ÿ1A8(b)(2), substituted ``to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or'' for ``brought by ambassadors or other public ministers of foreign states or to which consuls or''.

I74Effective Date of T11978K Amendment

I21Amendment by Pub. L. 95ÿ09393 effective at the end of the ninety-day period beginning on Sept. 30, 1978, see section 9 of Pub. L. 95ÿ09393, set out as an Effective Date note under section 254a of Title 22, Foreign Relations and Intercourse.

I74Statutes Governing Writs of Error To Apply to Appeals

I11(e) The Supreme Court may prescribe rules, in accordance with section 2072 of this title, to provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d).

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A41(1) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A24, par. 1, 36 Stat. 1091; May 14, 1934, ch. 283, ÿ1A1, 48 Stat. 775; Aug. 21, 1937, ch. 726, ÿ1A1, 50 Stat. 738; Apr. 20, 1940, ch. 117, 54 Stat. 143).

I21Other provisions of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., are incorporated in sections 1331, 1341, 1342, 1345, 1354, and 1359 of this title. (See reviser's notes under said sections.)

I21Jurisdiction conferred by other sections of this chapter, except section 1335, is not dependent upon diversity of citizenship. (See annotations under former section 41 of title 28, U.S.C.A., and 35 C.J.S., p. 833 et seq. ÿ1A30ÿ0943. See, also, reviser's note under section 1331 of this title.) As to citizenship of bank where jurisdiction depends upon diversity of citizenship, see section 1348 of this title.

I21Words ``all civil actions'' were substituted for ``all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity'' in order to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Words ``or citizens of the District of Columbia, Territory of Hawaii, or Alaska, and any State or Territory'' which were inserted by the amendatory act April 20, 1940, are omitted. The word ``States'' is defined in this section and enumeration of the references is unnecessary.

I21The revised section conforms with the views of Philip F. Herrick, United States Attorney, Puerto Rico, who observed that the act of April 20, 1940, permitted action between a citizen of Hawaii and of Puerto Rico, but not between a citizen of New York and Puerto Rico, in the district court.

I21This changes the law to insure uniformity. The 1940 amendment applied only to the provision as to controversies between ``citizens of different States.'' The new definition in subsection (b) extends the 1940 amendment to apply to controversies between citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.

I21The diversity of citizenship language of section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as amended in 1940, was described as ambiguous in T3McGarry v. City of BethlehemK, 45 F.Supp. 385, 386. In that case the 1940 amendment was held unconstitutional insofar as it affected the District of Columbia. However, two other district courts upheld the amendment. T3Winkler v. DanielsK, D.C.Va. 1942, 43 F.Supp. 265; T3Glaeser v. Acacia Mutual Life Ass'nK., D.C.Cal. 1944, 55 F.Supp. 925.

I21This section is intended to cover all diversity of citizenship instances in civil actions in accordance with the judicial construction of the language in the original section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Therefore, the revised language covers civil actions between_

I21Citizens of a State, and citizens of other States and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;

I21Citizens of a Territory or the District of Columbia, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof;

I21Citizens of different States;

I21Citizens of different Territories;

I21Citizens of a State, and citizens of Territories;

I21Citizens of a State or Territory, and citizens of the District of Columbia;

I21Citizens of a State, and foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof.

I21The revised section removes an uncertainty referred to in the McGarry case, supra, as to whether Congress intended to permit citizens of the Territories or the District of Columbia to sue a State or Territory itself rather than the citizens thereof. The court observed that ``Congress could hardly have had such intention.''

I21The sentence ``The foregoing provisions as to the sum or value of the matter in controversy shall not be construed to apply to any of the cases mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs of this section'' was omitted as unnecessary. Those paragraphs are (2)ÿ09(28) of said section 41 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which are revised and incorporated in this chapter and, except for those relating to actions against the United States and interpleader, contains no provision as to a sum or value necessary to confer jurisdiction. Consequently the omitted sentence is covered by excluding such requirement.

I21Section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as originally enacted, purported to include all jurisdictional provisions relating to the district courts. Subsequently, many special jurisdictional provisions were enacted and incorporated in other titles of the U.S.C., 1940 ed., as follows:

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A41(3) and 371 (3), (4) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A24, par. 3, 256, pars. 3, 4, 36 Stat. 1091, 1160; Oct. 6, 1917, ch. 97, ÿ1A1, 2, 40 Stat. 395; June 10, 1922, ch. 216, ÿ1A1, 2, 42 Stat. 634).

I21Section consolidates certain provisions of sections 41(3), 371(3) and 371(4) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Other provisions of sections 41(3) and 371(4), relating to seizures, are incorporated in section 1356 of this title. (See reviser's note thereunder.)

I21The ``saving to suitors'' clause in sections 41(3) and 371(3) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was changed by substituting the words ``any other remedy to which he is otherwise entitled'' for the words ``the right of a common law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.'' The substituted language is simpler and more expressive of the original intent of Congress and is in conformity with Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure abolishing the distinction between law and equity.

I21Provisions of section 41(3) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., based on the 1917 and 1922 amendments, relating to remedies under State workmen's compensation laws, were deleted. Such amendments were held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. (See T3Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. StewartK, 1920, 40 S.Ct. 438, 253 U.S. 149, 64 L.Ed. 834, and T3State of Washington v. W. C.

Subsection (c) and this subsection shall not be construed to limit the applicability of the stay provided for by section 362 of title 11, United States Code, as such section applies to an action affecting the property of the estate in bankruptcy.

I11(e) The district court in which a case under title 11 is commenced or is pending shall have exclusive jurisdiction_

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A41(20), 931(a), 932 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A24, par. 20, 36 Stat. 1093; Nov. 23, 1921, ch. 136, ÿ1A1310(c), 42 Stat. 311; June 2, 1924, ch. 234, ÿ1A1025(c), 43 Stat. 348; Feb. 24, 1925, ch. 309, 43 Stat. 972; Feb. 26, 1926, ch. 27, ÿ1A1122(c), 1200, 44 Stat. 121, 125; Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 753, ÿ1A410(a), 411, 60 Stat. 843).

I21Section consolidates provisions of section 41(20) conferring jurisdiction upon the district court, in civil actions against the United States, with the first sentence of section 931(a) relating to jurisdiction of the district courts in tort claims cases, and those provisions of section 932 making the provisions of said section 41(20), relating to counterclaim and set-off, applicable to tort claims cases, all of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Provision in section 931(a) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for trials without a jury, is incorporated in section 2402 of this revised title. For other provisions thereof, see Distribution Table.

I21Words ``commencing an action under this section'' in subsec. (c) of this revised section cover the provision in section 932 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring that the same provisions ``for counterclaim and set-off'' shall apply to tort claims cases brought in the district courts.

I21The phrase in section 931(a) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``accruing on and after January 1, 1945'' was omitted because executed as of the date of the enactment of this revised title.

I21Provisions in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to time for commencing action against United States and jury trial constitute sections 2401 and 2402 of this title. (See reviser's notes under said sections.)

I21Words in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``commenced after passage of the Revenue Act of 1921'' were not included in revised subsection (a)(1) because obsolete and superfluous. Actions under this section involving erroneous or illegal assessments by the collector of taxes would be barred unless filed within the 5-year limitation period of section 1113(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 116. (See T3United States v. A. S. Kreider CoK., 1941, 61 S.Ct. 1007, 313 U.S. 443, 85 L.Ed. 1447.)

I21Words in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``if the collector of internal revenue is dead or is not in office at the time such action or proceeding is commenced'' were omitted.

I21The revised section retains the language of section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to actions against the United States if the collector is dead or not in office when action is commenced, and consequently maintains the long existing distinctions in practice between actions against the United States and actions against the collector who made the assessment or collection. In the latter class of actions either party may demand a jury trial while jury trial is denied in actions against the United States. See section 2402 of this title. In reality all such actions are against the United States and not against local collectors. (See T3Lowe v. United StatesK, 1938, 58 S.Ct. 896, 304 U.S. 302, 82 L.Ed. 1362; T3Manseau v. United StatesK, D.C.Mich. 1943, 52 F.Supp. 395, and T3Combined Metals Reduction Co. v. United StatesK, D.C.Utah 1943, 53 F.Supp. 739.)

I21The revised subsection (c)(1) omitted clause: ``but no suit pending on the 27th day of June 1898 shall abate or be affected by this provision,'' contained in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as obsolete and superfluous. The words contained in section 41(20) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``claims growing out of the Civil War, and commonly known as `war-claims,' or to hear and determine other claims which had been reported adversely prior to the 3d day of March 1887 by any court, department, or commission authorized to have and determine the same,'' were omitted for the same reason.

I21The words ``in a civil action or in admiralty,'' in subsection (a)(2), were substituted for ``either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty'' to conform to Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Words in section 41(20) ``in respect to which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States, either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable'' were omitted from subsection (a)(2) of this revised section as unnecessary. See reviser's note under section 1491 of this title.

I21For jurisdiction of The Tax Court to review claims for refunds of processing taxes collected under the unconstitutional Agriculture Adjustment Act, see sections 644ÿ09659 of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture, and the 1942 Revenue Act, Act Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 610, title V, ÿ1A510(a), (c), (d), 56 Stat. 667. (See, also, T3Lamborn v. United StatesK, C.C.P.A. 1939, 104 F.2d 75, certiorari denied 60 S.Ct. 115, 308 U.S. 589, 84 L.Ed. 493.)

I21Provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for payment of costs upon dismissal of an action for lack of jurisdiction are incorporated in section 1919 of this title. Other provisions of said section 80 appear in section 1447 of this title.

I21Provisions of section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for dismissal of an action not really and substantially involving a dispute or controversy within the jurisdiction of a district court, were omitted as unnecessary. Any court will dismiss a case not within its jurisdiction when its attention is drawn to the fact, or even on its own motion.

I21The assignee clause in section 41(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``is a jumble of legislative jargon.'' (For further references to the consequences of ``its obscure phraseology,'' see, 35 Ill. Law Rev., January 1941, pp. 569ÿ09571.)

I21The revised section changes this clause by confining its application to cases wherein the assignment is improperly or collusively made to invoke jurisdiction. Furthermore, the difficulty of applying the original clause is overcome and the original purpose of such clause is better served by substantially following section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21The assignee clause was incorporated in the original Judiciary Act of 1789. Such section 80 was enacted in 1875. The history of the assignee clause ``shows clearly that its purpose and effect, at the time of its enactment were to prevent the conferring of jurisdiction on the Federal courts, on grounds of diversity of citizenship, by assignment, in cases where it would not otherwise exist.'' (T3Sowell v. Federal Reserve BankK, 1925, 45 S.Ct. 528, 529, 268 U.S. 449, 453, 69 L.Ed. 1041, 1048.) Thus the purpose of the assignee clause was to prevent the manufacture of Federal jurisdiction by the device of assignment. It achieves this purpose only partially. For example, the assignee clause excepts two types of choses in action from its coverage: (1) Foreign bill of exchange; and (2) corporate bearer paper. But this does not prevent the use of assignment of these choses in action to create the necessary diversity or alienage for jurisdictional purposes. Such section 80 does, however, prevent that. (See T3Bullard v. City of CiscoK, 1933, 54 S.Ct. 177, 290 U.S. 179, 78 L.Ed. 254, 93 A.L.R. 141.) Its coverage against collusive jurisdiction is unlimited, and its approach is direct. The assignee clause, on the other hand, prevents the bona fide assignee of a chose in action within its terms from resorting to the Federal courts unless there is jurisdiction to support the assignee-plaintiff's case and a showing that there would have been jurisdiction if the assignor had brought the action in lieu of the assignee-plaintiff. Since the assignee clause deals with the bona fide assignee, there has been much litigation to determine the assignments which should or should not be within the purview of the clause. Thus the courts have thought it advisable to limit the term ``chose in action'' and exclude from its scope (1) an implied in law duty or promise, and (2) a transfer of a property interest; and to exclude an assignment by operation of law from the coverage of the clause. Intermediate assignments and reassignment also give difficulty.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A111, 112 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A50, 51, 36 Stat. 1101; Sept. 19, 1922, ch. 345, 42 Stat. 849; Mar. 4, 1925, ch. 526, ÿ1A1, 43 Stat. 1264; Apr. 16, 1936, ch. 230, 49 Stat. 1213).

I21Section consolidates section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 112 of such title.

I21The portion of section 112 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue generally constitutes this section and the parts relating to arrest of the defendant, venue and process in stockholders' actions constitute sections 1401, 1693, and 1695 of this title.

I21Provision in section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that a district court may proceed as to parties before it although one or more defendants do not reside in the district, and that its judgment shall be without prejudice to such absent defendants, was omitted as covered by rule 19(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Word ``action'' was substituted for ``suit'' in view of Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Word ``reside'' was substituted for ``whereof he is an inhabitant'' for clarity inasmuch as ``inhabitant'' and ``resident'' are synonymous. (See T3Ex parte ShawK, 1892, 12 S.Ct. 935, 145 U.S. 444, 36 L.Ed. 768; T3Standard Stoker Co., Inc. v. LowerK, D.C., 1931, 46 F.2d 678; T3Edgewater Realty Co. v. Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad CoK., D.C., 1943, 49 F.Supp. 807.)

I21Reference to ``all plaintiffs'' and ``all defendants'' were substituted for references to ``the plaintiff'' and ``the defendant,'' in view of many decisions holding that the singular terms were used in a collective sense. (See T3Smith v. LyonK, 1890, 10 S.Ct. 303, 133 U.S. 315, 33 L.Ed. 635; T3Hooe v. JamiesonK, 1897, 17 S.Ct. 596, 166 U.S. 395, 41 L.Ed. 1049; and T3Fetzer v. LivermoreK, D.C., 1926, 15 F.2d 462.)

I21In subsection (c), references to defendants ``found'' within a district or voluntarily appearing were omitted. The use of the word ``found'' made section 111 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ambiguous. The argument that an action could be brought in the district where one defendant resided and a nonresident defendant was ``found,'' was rejected in T3Camp v. GressK, 1919, 39 S.Ct. 478, 250 U.S. 308, 63 L.Ed. 997. However, this ambiguity will be obviated in the future by the omission of such reference.

I21Subsection (d) of this section is added to give statutory recognition to the weight of authority concerning a rule of venue as to which there has been a sharp conflict of decisions. (See T3Sandusky Foundry & Machine Co. v. DeLavandK, 1918, D.C.Ohio, 251 F. 631, 632, and cases cited. See also T3Keating v. Pennsylvania CoK., 1917, D.C.Ohio, 245 F. 155 and cases cited.)

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A104, 106, 107, and 108, and section 3745(c) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A43, 45, 46, 47, 36 Stat. 1100; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, ÿ1A3745(c), 53 Stat. 460).

I21This section consolidates section 3745(c) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with sections 104, 106, 107, and 108 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to venue in civil proceedings to recover and enforce civil fines, penalties, and forfeitures, pecuniary or otherwise.

Subsection (e) is based on such section 108 of title 28.

I21Provisions of section 3745(c) of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that such suit may be brought ``before any other court of competent jurisdiction'' were omitted as misleading surplusage, since United States district courts, under section 1355 of this title, have exclusive jurisdiction.

I21Subsection (d) was added for completeness and clarity.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21While section 3745(c) of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, is one of the sources of this section, it was eliminated from the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. Therefore, such section 3745(c) remains in Title 26. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I89. Internal revenue taxes

I11Any civil action for the collection of internal revenue taxes may be brought in the district where the liability for such tax accrues, in the district of the taxpayer's residence, or in the district where the return was filed.

I21Section consolidates section 3744 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code, with section 105 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Words ``or in the district where the return was filed'' are new. This extension of venue will permit of an action in a district easily determinable for collection of revenue earned in several districts, or States, but the return for which is filed with one collector.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21While section 3744 of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code [1939], is one of the sources of this section, it was eliminated from the schedule of repeals by Senate amendment. Therefore, it remains in Title 26 [I.R.C. 1939]. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I21Section consolidates sections 119 and 163 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology and substance.

I21Section 119 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related only to transfer of cases from one division to another on stipulation of the parties.

I21Subsection (a) was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of forum non conveniens, permitting transfer to a more convenient forum, even though the venue is proper. As an example of the need of such a provision, see T3Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. KepnerK, 1941, 62 S.Ct. 6, 314 U.S. 44, 86 L.Ed. 28, which was prosecuted under the Federal Employer's Liability Act in New York, although the accident occurred and the employee resided in Ohio. The new subsection requires the court to determine that the transfer is necessary for convenience of the parties and witnesses, and further, that it is in the interest of justice to do so.

I21Sections 143, 172, 177, and 181 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the district courts of Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, and Ohio, contained special provisions similar to subsection (b), applicable to those States.

This revised subsection extends to all judicial districts and permits transfer of cases between divisions. Criminal cases may be transferred pursuant to Rules 19ÿ0921 of the new Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the criminal provisions of said section 163 are therefore omitted.

I711948 T4Act

I21Subsection (a) provides statutory sanction for transfer instead of dismissal, where venue is improperly laid.

I21Subsection (b) is declaratory of existing law. (See T3Panama R.R. Co. v. JohnsonK, 1924, 44 S.Ct. 391, 264 U.S. 375, 68 L.Ed. 748.) It makes clear the intent of Congress that venue provisions are not jurisdictional but may be waived.

I711949 T4Act

I21This section removes an ambiguity in section 1406(a) of title 28, U.S.C., by substituting ``may'' for ``shall'', thus making it clear that the court may decline to transfer a case brought in the wrong district under circumstances where it would not be in the interest of justice to make such transfer. [The amendment to section 1406(a) of this title described in this note was altered in the bill as enacted. See Cong. Rec., vol. 95, pt. 5, pp. 5826, 5827, 6283, 6284.]

I89. Multidistrict litigation

I11(a) When civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact are pending in different districts, such actions may be transferred to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. Such transfers shall be made by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation authorized by this section upon its determination that transfers for such proceedings will be for the convenience of parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions. Each action so transferred shall be remanded by the panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have been previously terminated: T3Provided, howeverK, That the panel may separate any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim, or third-party claim and remand any of such claims before the remainder of the action is remanded.

I11(b) Such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings shall be conducted by a judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation. For this purpose, upon request of the panel, a circuit judge or a district judge may be designated and assigned temporarily for service in the transferee district by the Chief Justice of the United States or the chief judge of the circuit, as may be required, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 13 of this title. With the consent of the transferee district court, such actions may be assigned by the panel to a judge or judges of such district. The judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned, the members of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation, and other circuit and district judges designated when needed by the panel may exercise the powers of a district judge in any district for the purpose of conducting pretrial depositions in such coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.

I11(c) Proceedings for the transfer of an action under this section may be initiated by_

I12(i) the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation upon its own initiative, or

I12(ii) motion filed with the panel by a party in any action in which transfer for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings under this section may be appropriate. A copy of such motion shall be filed in the district court in which the moving party's action is pending.

Q04

I11The panel shall give notice to the parties in all actions in which transfers for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings are contemplated, and such notice shall specify the time and place of any hearing to determine whether such transfer shall be made. Orders of the panel to set a hearing and other orders of the panel issued prior to the order either directing or denying transfer shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court in which a transfer hearing is to be or has been held. The panel's order of transfer shall be based upon a record of such hearing at which material evidence may be offered by any party to an action pending in any district that would be affected by the proceedings under this section, and shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon such record. Orders of transfer and such other orders as the panel may make thereafter shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of the transferee district and shall be effective when thus filed. The clerk of the transferee district court shall forthwith transmit a certified copy of the panel's order to transfer to the clerk of the district court from which the action is being transferred. An order denying transfer shall be filed in each district wherein there is a case pending in which the motion for transfer has been made.

I11(d) The judicial panel on multidistrict litigation shall consist of seven circuit and district judges designated from time to time by the Chief Justice of the United States, no two of whom shall be from the same circuit. The concurrence of four members shall be necessary to any action by the panel.

I11(e) No proceedings for review of any order of the panel may be permitted except by extraordinary writ pursuant to the provisions of title 28, section 1651, United States Code. Petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order of the panel to set a transfer hearing and other orders of the panel issued prior to the order either directing or denying transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the district in which a hearing is to be or has been held. Petitions for an extraordinary writ to review an order to transfer or orders subsequent to transfer shall be filed only in the court of appeals having jurisdiction over the transferee district. There shall be no appeal or review of an order of the panel denying a motion to transfer for consolidated or coordinated proceedings.

I11(f) The panel may prescribe rules for the conduct of its business not inconsistent with Acts of Congress and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I11(g) Nothing in this section shall apply to any action in which the United States is a complainant arising under the antitrust laws. ``Antitrust laws'' as used herein include those acts referred to in the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended (38 Stat. 730; 15 U.S.C. 12), and also include the Act of June 19, 1936 (49 Stat. 1526; 15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, and 13b) and the Act of September 26, 1914, as added March 21, 1938 (52 Stat. 116, 117; 15 U.S.C. 56); but shall not include section 4A of the Act of October 15, 1914, as added July 7, 1955 (69 Stat. 282; 15 U.S.C. 15a).

I11(h) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1404 or subsection (f) of this section, the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation may consolidate and transfer with or without the consent of the parties, for both pretrial purposes and for trial, any action brought under section 4C of the Clayton Act.

I89. Removal of civil actions

I11(a) T4GenerallyK._Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.

I11(b) T4Removal Based on Diversity of CitizenshipK._(1) In determining whether a civil action is removable on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title, the citizenship of defendants sued under fictitious names shall be disregarded.

I11(2) A civil action otherwise removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.

I11(c) T4Joinder of Federal Law Claims and State Law ClaimsK._(1) If a civil action includes_

I12(A) a claim arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States (within the meaning of section 1331 of this title), and

I12(B) a claim not within the original or supplemental jurisdiction of the district court or a claim that has been made nonremovable by statute,

Q04

I10the entire action may be removed if the action would be removable without the inclusion of the claim described in subparagraph (B).

I11(2) Upon removal of an action described in paragraph (1), the district court shall sever from the action all claims described in paragraph (1)(B) and shall remand the severed claims to the State court from which the action was removed. Only defendants against whom a claim described in paragraph (1)(A) has been asserted are required to join in or consent to the removal under paragraph (1).

I11(d) T4Actions Against Foreign StatesK._Any civil action brought in a State court against a foreign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title may be removed by the foreign state to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending. Upon removal the action shall be tried by the court without jury. Where removal is based upon this subsection, the time limitations of section 1446(b) of this chapter may be enlarged at any time for cause shown.

I11(e) T4Multiparty, Multiforum JurisdictionK._(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, a defendant in a civil action in a State court may remove the action to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where the action is pending if_

I12(A) the action could have been brought in a United States district court under section 1369 of this title; or

I12(B) the defendant is a party to an action which is or could have been brought, in whole or in part, under section 1369 in a United States district court and arises from the same accident as the action in State court, even if the action to be removed could not have been brought in a district court as an original matter.

Q04

I10The removal of an action under this subsection shall be made in accordance with section 1446 of this title, except that a notice of removal may also be filed before trial of the action in State court within 30 days after the date on which the defendant first becomes a party to an action under section 1369 in a United States district court that arises from the same accident as the action in State court, or at a later time with leave of the district court.

I11(2) Whenever an action is removed under this subsection and the district court to which it is removed or transferred under section 1407(j) has made a liability determination requiring further proceedings as to damages, the district court shall remand the action to the State court from which it had been removed for the determination of damages, unless the court finds that, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice, the action should be retained for the determination of damages.

I11(3) Any remand under paragraph (2) shall not be effective until 60 days after the district court has issued an order determining liability and has certified its intention to remand the removed action for the determination of damages. An appeal with respect to the liability determination of the district court may be taken during that 60-day period to the court of appeals with appellate jurisdiction over the district court. In the event a party files such an appeal, the remand shall not be effective until the appeal has been finally disposed of. Once the remand has become effective, the liability determination shall not be subject to further review by appeal or otherwise.

I11(4) Any decision under this subsection concerning remand for the determination of damages shall not be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.

I11(5) An action removed under this subsection shall be deemed to be an action under section 1369 and an action in which jurisdiction is based on section 1369 of this title for purposes of this section and sections 1407, 1697, and 1785 of this title.

I11(6) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the authority of the district court to transfer or dismiss an action on the ground of inconvenient forum.

I11(f) T4Derivative Removal JurisdictionK._The court to which a civil action is removed under this section is not precluded from hearing and determining any claim in such civil action because the State court from which such civil action is removed did not have jurisdiction over that claim.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A71, 114 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A28, 53, 36 Stat. 1094, 1101; Jan. 20, 1914, ch. 11, 38 Stat. 278; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, ÿ1A1, 45 Stat. 54).

I21Section consolidates removal provisions of sections 71 and 114 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and is intended to resolve ambiguities and conflicts of decisions.

I21Phrases such as ``in suits of a civil nature, at law or in equity,'' the words ``case,'' ``cause,'' ``suit,'' and the like have been omitted and the words ``civil action'' substituted in harmony with Rules 2 and 81(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Ambiguous phrases such as ``the District Court of the United States for the proper district'' have been clarified by the substitution of the phrase ``the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.'' (See T3General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore & M.S. Ry. CoK., 1922, 43 S.Ct. 107, 112, 260 U.S. 261, 67 L.Ed. 244 and cases cited therein.)

I21All the provisions with reference to removal of controversies between citizens of different States because of inability, from prejudice or local influence, to obtain justice, have been discarded. These provisions, born of the bitter sectional feelings engendered by the Civil War and the Reconstruction period, have no place in the jurisprudence of a nation since united by three wars against foreign powers. Indeed, the practice of removal for prejudice or local influence has not been employed much in recent years.

I21Subsection (c) has been substituted for the provision in section 71 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``and when in any suit mentioned in this section, there shall be a controversy which is wholly between citizens of different States, and which can be fully determined as between them, then either one or more of the defendants actually interested in such controversy may remove said suit into the district court of the United States.''

I21This quoted language has occasioned much confusion. The courts have attempted to distinguish between separate and separable controversies, a distinction which is sound in theory but illusory in substance. (See 41 Harv. L. Rev. 1048; 35 Ill. L. Rev. 576.)

I21Subsection (c) permits the removal of a separate cause of action but not of a separable controversy unless it constitutes a separate and independent claim or cause of action within the original jurisdiction of United States District Courts. In this respect it will somewhat decrease the volume of Federal litigation.

I21Rules 18, 20, and 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit the most liberal joinder of parties, claims, and remedies in civil actions. Therefore there will be no procedural difficulty occasioned by the removal of the entire action. Conversely, if the court so desires, it may remand to the State court all nonremovable matters.

I21The provisions of section 71 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to removal of actions under the Federal Employer's Liability Act (U.S.C., 1940 ed., title 45, Railroads, ÿ1A51ÿ0960) and actions against a carrier for loss, damage, or delay to shipments under section 20 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation, are incorporated in section 1445 of this title.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A71 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A28, 36 Stat. 1094; Jan. 20, 1914, ch. 11, 38 Stat. 278; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, ÿ1A1, 45 Stat. 54).

I21The words ``or its receivers or trustees'' were inserted in both subsections to make clear that nonremovable actions against a carrier do not become removable under section 1442 of this title when filed against court receivers or trustees.

I21This was the unquestioned rule prior to the act of Aug. 23, 1916, ch. 399, 39 Stat. 532, amending section 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and permitting removal of actions against officers of United States courts. The cases are in conflict as to whether under that amendment the case becomes removable when the carrier is in receivership or undergoing reorganization. The revised section resolves the conflict by denying the right of removal to receivers and trustees where it would be nonexistent if the carrier were the party defendant. Thus the subject matter rather than legalistic distinctions as to the identity of the parties is made determinative consideration.

I21A reference in section 71 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to sections 51ÿ0959 of title 45, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Railroads, was changed to ``51ÿ0960.'' Such sections 51ÿ0959 embraced all of chapter 2 of said title 45 when the law on which such section 71 is based was enacted, but a new section (60) was added in 1939.

I21Other provisions of section 71 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., appear in section 1441 of this title.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I89. Procedure for removal of civil actions

I11(a) T4GenerallyK._A defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action from a State court shall file in the district court of the United States for the district and division within which such action is pending a notice of removal signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal, together with a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action.

I11(b) T4Requirements; GenerallyK._(1) The notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based, or within 30 days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant, whichever period is shorter.

I11(2)(A) When a civil action is removed solely under section 1441(a), all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action.

I11(B) Each defendant shall have 30 days after receipt by or service on that defendant of the initial pleading or summons described in paragraph (1) to file the notice of removal.

I11(C) If defendants are served at different times, and a later-served defendant files a notice of removal, any earlier-served defendant may consent to the removal even though that earlier-served defendant did not previously initiate or consent to removal.

I11(3) Except as provided in subsection (c), if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable, a notice of removal may be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.

I11(c) T4Requirements; Removal Based on Diversity of CitizenshipK._(1) A case may not be removed under subsection (b)(3) on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by section 1332 more than 1 year after commencement of the action, unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has acted in bad faith in order to prevent a defendant from removing the action.

I11(2) If removal of a civil action is sought on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a), the sum demanded in good faith in the initial pleading shall be deemed to be the amount in controversy, except that_

I12(A) the notice of removal may assert the amount in controversy if the initial pleading seeks_

I13(i) nonmonetary relief; or

I13(ii) a money judgment, but the State practice either does not permit demand for a specific sum or permits recovery of damages in excess of the amount demanded; and

Q04

I12(B) removal of the action is proper on the basis of an amount in controversy asserted under subparagraph (A) if the district court finds, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds the amount specified in section 1332(a).

Q04

I11(3)(A) If the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable solely because the amount in controversy does not exceed the amount specified in section 1332(a), information relating to the amount in controversy in the record of the State proceeding, or in responses to discovery, shall be treated as an ``other paper'' under subsection (b)(3).

I11(B) If the notice of removal is filed more than 1 year after commencement of the action and the district court finds that the plaintiff deliberately failed to disclose the actual amount in controversy to prevent removal, that finding shall be deemed bad faith under paragraph (1).

I11(d) T4Notice to Adverse Parties and State CourtK._Promptly after the filing of such notice of removal of a civil action the defendant or defendants shall give written notice thereof to all adverse parties and shall file a copy of the notice with the clerk of such State court, which shall effect the removal and the State court shall proceed no further unless and until the case is remanded.

I11(e) T4Counterclaim in K337T4 ProceedingK._With respect to any counterclaim removed to a district court pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the district court shall resolve such counterclaim in the same manner as an original complaint under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that the payment of a filing fee shall not be required in such cases and the counterclaim shall relate back to the date of the original complaint in the proceeding before the International Trade Commission under section 337 of that Act.

I11(g)ÿ1A\1\N Where the civil action or criminal prosecution that is removable under section 1442(a) is a proceeding in which a judicial order for testimony or documents is sought or issued or sought to be enforced, the 30-day requirement of subsection (b) of this section and paragraph (1) of section 1455(b) is satisfied if the person or entity desiring to remove the proceeding files the notice of removal not later than 30 days after receiving, through service, notice of any such proceeding.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A72, 74, 75, 76 (May 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A29, 31, 32, 33, 36 Stat. 1095, 1097; Aug. 23, 1916, ch. 399, 39 Stat. 532; July 30, 1977, Pub. L. 95ÿ0978, ÿ1A3, 91 Stat. 321.)

I21Section consolidates portions of sections 74, 75, and 76 with section 72 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with important changes of substance and phraseology.

I21Subsection (a), providing for the filing of the removal petition in the district court, is substituted for the requirement of sections 72 and 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the petition be filed in the State court. This conforms to the method prescribed by section 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and to the recommendation of United States District Judges Calvin W. Chesnut and T. Waties Warring approved by the Committee of the Judicial Conference on the Revision of the Judicial Code.

I21Subsection (b) makes uniform the time for filing petitions to remove all civil actions within twenty days after commencement of action or service of process whichever is later, instead of ``at any time before the defendant is required by the laws of the State or the rule of the State court in which such suit is brought to answer or plead'' as required by section 72 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. As thus revised, the section will give adequate time and operate uniformly throughout the Federal jurisdiction. The provisions of sections 74 and 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for filing at any time ``before trial or final hearing'' in civil rights cases and cases involving revenue officers, court officers and officers of either House of Congress were omitted.

I21Subsection (c) embodies the provisions of sections 74 and 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for filing the removal petition before trial and makes them applicable to all criminal prosecutions but not to civil actions. This provision was retained to protect Federal officers enforcing revenue or criminal laws from being rushed to trial in State courts before petition for removal could be filed. Words ``or final hearing'' following the words ``before trial,'' were omitted for purposes of clarity and simplification of procedure.

I21The provision of said section 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for certificate of counsel that he has examined the proceedings and carefully inquired into all matters set forth in the petition and believes them to be true, was omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Subsection (d) is derived from sections 72 and 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., but the requirement for cost bond is limited to civil actions in conformity with the more enlightened trend of modern procedure to remove all unnecessary impediments to the administration of criminal justice. Provisions of said section 72 as to the conditions of the bond were rewritten because inappropriate when the petition for removal is filed in the Federal court.

I21Subsection (e) provides for notice to the adverse parties and for the filing in the State court of a copy of the petition for removal in substitution for the requirements of sections 72 and 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for the filing of the removal petition in the State court. The last sentence of subsection (e) is derived from sections 72, 74 and 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Subsection (f) is derived from sections 75 and 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Since the procedure in removal cases is now governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [Rule 81(c)] and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [Rule 54(b)], the detailed directions of the various sections with respect to such procedure were omitted as unnecessary.

I21Thus the provision of section 72 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to appearance, special bail and filing the record were omitted as covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 64, 81(c).

I21The provisions of section 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to the effect of security and other proceedings and remedies in the State court were omitted as covered by section 1450 of this title.

I21The requirements of section 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., that the clerk of the State court shall furnish copies of pleadings and proceedings to the petitioner and that the petitioner shall file the same in the district court are covered by section 1447 of this title.

I21The provisions of section 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring the adverse parties to plead anew in the district court were omitted as unnecessary in view of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 81(c). The last sentence of such section was omitted as covered by section 1447(d) of this title.

I711949 T4Act

I21Subsection (b) of section 1446 of title 28, U.S.C., as revised, has been found to create difficulty in those States, such as New York, where suit is commenced by the service of a summons and the plaintiff's initial pleading is not required to be served or filed until later.

I21The first paragraph of the amendment to subsection (b) corrects this situation by providing that the petition for removal need not be filed until 20 days after the defendant has received a copy of the plaintiff's initial pleading.

I21This provision, however, without more, would create further difficulty in those States, such as Kentucky, where suit is commenced by the filing of the plaintiff's initial pleading and the issuance and service of a summons without any requirement that a copy of the pleading be served upon or otherwise furnished to the defendant. Accordingly the first paragraph of the amendment provides that in such cases the petition for removal shall be filed within 20 days after the service of the summons.

I21The first paragraph of the amendment conforms to the amendment of rule 81(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, relating to removed actions, adopted by the Supreme Court on December 29, 1948, and reported by the Court to the present session of Congress.

I21The second paragraph of the amendment to subsection (b) is intended to make clear that the right of removal may be exercised at a later stage of the case if the initial pleading does not state a removable case but its removability is subsequently disclosed. This is declaratory of the existing rule laid down by the decisions. (See for example, T3Powers v. Chesapeake etc., Ry. CoK., 169 U.S. 92.)

I21In addition, this amendment clarifies the intent of section 1446(e) of title 28, U.S.C., to indicate that notice need not be given simultaneously with the filing, but may be given promptly thereafter.

I89. Procedure after removal generally

I11(a) In any case removed from a State court, the district court may issue all necessary orders and process to bring before it all proper parties whether served by process issued by the State court or otherwise.

I21Subsection (a) is derived from sections 72, 76, 81 and 83 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The remaining provisions of said section 83 are the basis of section 1448 of this title.

I21Subsection (b) is derived from sections 72, 74, 76 and 83 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which have been rewritten to provide the utmost simplicity and flexibility of procedure in bringing the State court record to the district court.

I21``(d) If any party fails to comply with its lawful orders, the district court may enter such further orders and judgments as justice requires.

I21``(e) If at any time before final judgment it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, the district court shall remand the case.

I21Subsection (e) [now subsec. (c)] is derived from sections 71 and 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. Such subsection is rewritten to eliminate the cumbersome procedure of remand. Under this chapter as revised, the petition for removal under section 1446 of this chapter will be filed in the Federal court in the first instance and the right of removal determined in that court before the petition is granted.

I21The provisions in section 80 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to actions commenced in district courts, as distinguished from actions removed thereto, are incorporated in section 1359 of this title. Other provisions of said section 80 appear in section 1919 of this title.

For the purpose of this paragraph, an express or implied contract with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Navy Exchanges, Marine Corps Exchanges, Coast Guard Exchanges, or Exchange Councils of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall be considered an express or implied contract with the United States.

I11(2) To provide an entire remedy and to complete the relief afforded by the judgment, the court may, as an incident of and collateral to any such judgment, issue orders directing restoration to office or position, placement in appropriate duty or retirement status, and correction of applicable records, and such orders may be issued to any appropriate official of the United States. In any case within its jurisdiction, the court shall have the power to remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as it may deem proper and just. The Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim by or against, or dispute with, a contractor arising under section 7104(b)(1) of title 41, including a dispute concerning termination of a contract, rights in tangible or intangible property, compliance with cost accounting standards, and other nonmonetary disputes on which a decision of the contracting officer has been issued under section 6ÿ1A\1\N of that Act.

I11(3) In exercising jurisdiction under this subsection, the courts shall give due regard to the interests of national defense and national security and the need for expeditious resolution of the action.

I11(4) In any action under this subsection, the courts shall review the agency's decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section 706 of title 5.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A250(1) (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231; ÿ1A145, 36 Stat. 1136).

I21District courts are given concurrent jurisdiction of certain claims against the United States under section 1346 of this title. (See also reviser's note under that section and section 1621 of this title relating to jurisdiction of the Tax Court.)

I21The proviso in section 250(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to claims growing out of the Civil War, commonly known as ``war claims,'' and other claims which had been reported adversely before March 3, 1887 by any court, department, or commission authorized to determine them, were omitted as obsolete.

I21The exception in section 250(1) of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as to pension claims appears in section 1501 of this title.

I21Words ``in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty, if the United States were suable'' were omitted as unnecessary since the Court of Claims manifestly, under this section will determine whether a petition against the United States states a cause of action. In any event, the Court of Claims has no admiralty jurisdiction, but the Suits in Admiralty Act, sections 741ÿ09752 of title 46, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Shipping, vests exclusive jurisdiction over suits in admiralty against the United States in the district courts. T3Sanday & Co. v. U.SK., 1932, 76 Ct.Cl. 370.

I21For additional provisions respecting jurisdiction of the court of claims in war contract settlement cases see section 114b of Title 41, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Contracts.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I711949 Act

I21Section 1505 is added to title 28, U.S.C., by this amendment to incorporate the act of August 13, 1946 (ch. 959, ÿ1A24, 60 Stat. 1055), which was originally classified to title 28, U.S.C., but was later transferred to title 25 of such code. Since such section 24 deals with jurisdiction of the Court of Claims it should be in title 28.

I21This amendatory section omits as surplusage all provisions of said section 24 except the first sentence, as being fully covered by the express provisions of sections 1503 and 2501 and other provisions of chapter 165 of title 28, U.S.C., relating to Court of Claims procedure.

I21The proviso of such section 24 is omitted as unnecessary since the provision conferring jurisdiction cannot in any view alter the relationship of the Government with its Indians.

I21The omitted language is as follows: ``In any suit brought under the jurisdiction conferred by this section the claimant shall be entitled to recover in the same manner, to the same extent, and subject to the same conditions and limitations, and the United States shall be entitled to the same defenses, both at law and in equity, and to the same offsets, counterclaims, and demands, as in cases brought in the Court of Claims under section 250 of this title: T3Provided, howeverK, That nothing contained in this section shall be construed as altering the fiduciary or other relations between the United States and the several Indian tribes, bands, or groups.''

I89. Findings and declaration of purpose

I11The Congress finds that the determination by United States courts of the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such courts would serve the interests of justice and would protect the rights of both foreign states and litigants in United States courts. Under international law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and their commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial activities. Claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided by courts of the United States and of the States in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter.

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and pursuant to the August 14, 2008, claims settlement agreement between the United States of America and Libya (Claims Settlement Agreement), and in recognition of the October 31, 2008, certification of the Secretary of State, pursuant to section 5(a)(2) of the Libyan Claims Resolution Act (Public Law 110ÿ09301), and in order to continue the process of normalizing relations between the United States and Libya, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. All claims within the terms of Article I of the Claims Settlement Agreement (Article I) are settled.

I21(a) Claims of United States nationals within the terms of Article I are espoused by the United States and are settled according to the terms of the Claims Settlement Agreement.

I21(i) No United States national may assert or maintain any claim within the terms of Article I in any forum, domestic or foreign, except under the procedures provided for by the Secretary of State.

I21(iii) Neither the dismissal of the lawsuit, nor anything in this order, shall affect the ability of any foreign national to pursue other available remedies for claims coming within the terms of Article I in foreign courts or through the efforts of foreign governments.

I86Waiver of Section T11083K of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year T12008

I21Determination of President of the United States, No. 2008ÿ099, Jan. 28, 2008, 73 F.R. 6571, provided:

I21Memorandum for the Secretary of State

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 1083(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (the ``Act''), I hereby determine that:

I21G7T2KAll provisions of section 1083 of the Act, if applied to Iraq or any agency or instrumentality thereof, may affect Iraq or its agencies or instrumentalities, by exposing Iraq or its agencies or instrumentalities to liability in United States courts and by entangling their assets in litigation.

I21G7T2KThe economic security and successful reconstruction of Iraq continue to be top national security priorities of the United States. Section 1083 of the Act threatens those key priorities. If permitted to apply to Iraq, section 1083 would risk the entanglement of substantial Iraqi assets in litigation in the United States_including those of the Development Fund for Iraq, the Central Bank of Iraq, and commercial entities in the United States in which Iraq has an interest. Section 1083 also would expose Iraq to new liability of at least several billion dollars by undoing judgments favorable to Iraq, by foreclosing available defenses on which Iraq is relying in pending litigation, and by creating a new Federal cause of action backed by the prospect of punitive damages to support claims that may previously have been foreclosed. If permitted to apply to Iraq, section 1083 would have a significant financial impact on Iraq and would result in the redirection of financial resources from the continued reconstruction of Iraq and the harming of Iraq's stability, contrary to the interests of the United States.

I21G7T2KA waiver of all provisions of section 1083 with respect to Iraq and any agency or instrumentality of Iraq is therefore in the national security interest of the United States and will promote the reconstruction of, the consolidation of democracy in, and the relations of the United States with, Iraq.

I21G7T2KIraq continues to be a reliable ally of the United States and a partner in combating acts of international terrorism. The November 26, 2007, Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America confirmed the commitment of the United States and Iraq to build an enduring relationship in the political, diplomatic, economic, and security arenas and to work together to combat all terrorist groups, including al-Qaida.

I21Accordingly, I hereby waive all provisions of section 1083 of the Act with respect to Iraq and any agency or instrumentality thereof.

I21You are authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this determination and waiver and the accompanying memorandum of justification [not set out in the Code], incorporated by reference herein, and to arrange for their publication in the Federal Register.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A342, 376, 377 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A234, 261, 262, 36 Stat. 1156, 1162).

I21Section consolidates sections 342, 376, and 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with necessary changes in phraseology.

I21Such section 342 provided:

I21``The Supreme Court shall have power to issue writs of prohibition to the district courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed under the authority of the United States, or to persons holding office under the authority of the United States, where a State, or an ambassador, or other public minister, or a consul, or vice consul is a party.''

I21Such section 376 provided:

I21``Writs of ne exeat may be granted by any justice of the Supreme Court, in cases where they might be granted by the Supreme Court; and by any district judge, in cases where they might be granted by the district court of which he is a judge. But no writ of ne exeat shall be granted unless a suit in equity is commenced, and satisfactory proof is made to the court or judge granting the same that the defendant designs quickly to depart from the United States.''

I21Such section 377 provided:

I21``The Supreme Court and the district courts shall have power to issue writs of scire facias. The Supreme Court, the circuit courts of appeals, and the district courts shall have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.''

I21The special provisions of section 342 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with reference to writs of prohibition and mandamus, admiralty courts and other courts and officers of the United States were omitted as unnecessary in view of the revised section.

I21The revised section extends the power to issue writs in aid of jurisdiction, to all courts established by Act of Congress, thus making explicit the right to exercise powers implied from the creation of such courts.

I21The provisions of section 376 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to the powers of a justice or judge in issuing writs of ne exeat were changed and made the basis of subsection (b) of the revised section but the conditions and limitations on the writ of ne exeat were omitted as merely confirmatory of well-settled principles of law.

I21The provision in section 377 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing issuance of writs of scire facias, was omitted in view of rule 81(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure abolishing such writ. The revised section is expressive of the construction recently placed upon such section by the Supreme Court in T3U.S. Alkali Export Assn. v. U.SK., 65 S.Ct. 1120, 325 U.S. 196, 89 L.Ed. 1554, and T3De Beers Consol. Mines v. U.SK., 65 S.Ct. 1130, 325 U.S. 212, 89 L.Ed. 1566.

I80ÿ1A1652

I89. State laws as rules of decision

I11The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.

I21``Civil actions'' was substituted for ``trials at common law'' to clarify the meaning of the Rules of Decision Act in the light of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such Act has been held to apply to suits in equity.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I21Section was extended to permit amendment of all jurisdictional allegations instead of merely allegations of diversity of citizenship as provided by section 399 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I80ÿ1A1654

I89. Appearance personally or by counsel

I11In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 944; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, ÿ1A91, 63 Stat. 103.)

I21Words ``as, by the rules of the said courts respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein,'' after ``counsel,'' were omitted as surplusage. The revised section and section 2071 of this title effect no change in the procedure of the Tax Court before which certain accountants may be admitted as counsel for litigants under Rule 2 of the Tax Court.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I711949 T4Act

I89. Lien enforcement; absent defendants

I11In an action in a district court to enforce any lien upon or claim to, or to remove any incumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to, real or personal property within the district, where any defendant cannot be served within the State, or does not voluntarily appear, the court may order the absent defendant to appear or plead by a day certain.

I11Such order shall be served on the absent defendant personally if practicable, wherever found, and also upon the person or persons in possession or charge of such property, if any. Where personal service is not practicable, the order shall be published as the court may direct, not less than once a week for six consecutive weeks.

I11If an absent defendant does not appear or plead within the time allowed, the court may proceed as if the absent defendant had been served with process within the State, but any adjudication shall, as regards the absent defendant without appearance, affect only the property which is the subject of the action. When a part of the property is within another district, but within the same state, such action may be brought in either district.

I11Any defendant not so personally notified may, at any time within one year after final judgment, enter his appearance, and thereupon the court shall set aside the judgment and permit such defendant to plead on payment of such costs as the court deems just.

I80ÿ1A1656

I89. Creation of new district or division or transfer of territory; lien enforcement

I11To enforce such lien, the clerk of the court in which the same is acquired, upon the request and at the cost of the party desiring the same, shall make a certified copy of the record thereof, which, when filed in the proper court of the district or division in which such property is situated after such creation or transfer shall be evidence in all courts and places equally with the original thereof; and, thereafter like proceedings shall be had thereon, and with the same effect, as though the case or proceeding had been originally instituted in such court.

I80ÿ1A1657

I89. Priority of civil actions

I11(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each court of the United States shall determine the order in which civil actions are heard and determined, except that the court shall expedite the consideration of any action brought under chapter 153 or section 1826 of this title, any action for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, or any other action if good cause therefor is shown. For purposes of this subsection, ``good cause'' is shown if a right under the Constitution of the United States or a Federal Statute (including rights under section 552 of title 5) would be maintained in a factual context that indicates that a request for expedited consideration has merit.

I11(b) The Judicial Conference of the United States may modify the rules adopted by the courts to determine the order in which civil actions are heard and determined, in order to establish consistency among the judicial circuits.

I74Findings and Purposes

I21Pub. L. 109ÿ092, ÿ1A2, Feb. 18, 2005, 119 Stat. 4, provided that:

I21``(a) T4FindingsK._Congress finds the following:

I22``(1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system when they permit the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.

I22``(2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the class action device that have_

I23``(A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly;

I23``(B) adversely affected interstate commerce; and

I23``(C) undermined public respect for our judicial system.

I22``(3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where_

I23``(A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;

I23``(B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members; and

I23``(C) confusing notices are published that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights.

I22``(4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial system, the free flow of interstate commerce, and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the United States Constitution, in that State and local courts are_

I23``(A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal court;

I23``(B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against out-of-State defendants; and

I23``(C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on other States and bind the rights of the residents of those States.

I21``(b) T4PurposesK._The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2005 Amendments note set out under section 1 of this title] are to_

I22``(1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members with legitimate claims;

I22``(2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance under diversity jurisdiction; and

I22``(3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering consumer prices.''

I89. Coupon settlements

I11(a) T4Contingent Fees in Coupon SettlementsK._If a proposed settlement in a class action provides for a recovery of coupons to a class member, the portion of any attorney's fee award to class counsel that is attributable to the award of the coupons shall be based on the value to class members of the coupons that are redeemed.

I11(b) T4Other Attorney's Fee Awards in Coupon Settlements._

I12(1) T4In generalK._If a proposed settlement in a class action provides for a recovery of coupons to class members, and a portion of the recovery of the coupons is not used to determine the attorney's fee to be paid to class counsel, any attorney's fee award shall be based upon the amount of time class counsel reasonably expended working on the action.

I12(2) T4Court approvalK._Any attorney's fee under this subsection shall be subject to approval by the court and shall include an appropriate attorney's fee, if any, for obtaining equitable relief, including an injunction, if applicable. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit application of a lodestar with a multiplier method of determining attorney's fees.

Q04

I11(c) T4Attorney's Fee Awards Calculated on a Mixed Basis in Coupon SettlementsK._If a proposed settlement in a class action provides for an award of coupons to class members and also provides for equitable relief, including injunctive relief_

I12(1) that portion of the attorney's fee to be paid to class counsel that is based upon a portion of the recovery of the coupons shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (a); and

I12(2) that portion of the attorney's fee to be paid to class counsel that is not based upon a portion of the recovery of the coupons shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (b).

Q04

I11(d) T4Settlement Valuation ExpertiseK._In a class action involving the awarding of coupons, the court may, in its discretion upon the motion of a party, receive expert testimony from a witness qualified to provide information on the actual value to the class members of the coupons that are redeemed.

I11(e) T4Judicial Scrutiny of Coupon SettlementsK._In a proposed settlement under which class members would be awarded coupons, the court may approve the proposed settlement only after a hearing to determine whether, and making a written finding that, the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate for class members. The court, in its discretion, may also require that a proposed settlement agreement provide for the distribution of a portion of the value of unclaimed coupons to 1 or more charitable or governmental organizations, as agreed to by the parties. The distribution and redemption of any proceeds under this subsection shall not be used to calculate attorneys' fees under this section.

I89. Protection against loss by class members

I89. Protection against discrimination based on geographic location

I21The consolidation of sections 661ÿ09667 and 671 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., permitted omission of obsolete, unnecessary and repetitive provisions in such sections. For example, the provision in section 665 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the court to require production of documents on a plea of non est factum, was omitted. Such plea is obsolete in Federal practice.

I21Numerous provisions with respect to authentication were omitted as covered by Rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Likewise the provision that official seals shall be judicially noticed was omitted as unnecessary.

I21Pub. L. 96ÿ09611, ÿ1A7, Dec. 28, 1980, 94 Stat. 3568, provided that:

I21``(a) The Congress finds that_

I22``(1) there is a large and growing number of cases annually involving disputes between persons claiming rights of custody and visitation of children under the laws, and in the courts, of different States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United States;

I22``(2) the laws and practices by which the courts of those jurisdictions determine their jurisdiction to decide such disputes, and the effect to be given the decisions of such disputes by the courts of other jurisdictions, are often inconsistent and conflicting;

I22``(3) those characteristics of the law and practice in such cases, along with the limits imposed by a Federal system on the authority of each such jurisdiction to conduct investigations and take other actions outside its own boundaries, contribute to a tendency of parties involved in such disputes to frequently resort to the seizure, restraint, concealment, and interstate transportation of children, the disregard of court orders, excessive relitigation of cases, obtaining of conflicting orders by the courts of various jurisdictions, and interstate travel and communication that is so expensive and time consuming as to disrupt their occupations and commercial activities; and

I22``(4) among the results of those conditions and activities are the failure of the courts of such jurisdictions to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the other jurisdictions, the deprivation of rights of liberty and property without due process of law, burdens on commerce among such jurisdictions and with foreign nations, and harm to the welfare of children and their parents and other custodians.

I21``(b) For those reasons it is necessary to establish a national system for locating parents and children who travel from one such jurisdiction to another and are concealed in connection with such disputes, and to establish national standards under which the courts of such jurisdictions will determine their jurisdiction to decide such disputes and the effect to be given by each such jurisdiction to such decisions by the courts of other such jurisdictions.

I21``(c) The general purposes of sections 6 to 10 of this Act [enacting this section and section 663 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare, amending sections 654 and 655 Title 42, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section, sections 663 and 1305 of Title 42, and section 1073 of Title 18, Crimes and Criminal Procedure] are to_

I22``(1) promote cooperation between State courts to the end that a determination of custody and visitation is rendered in the State which can best decide the case in the interest of the child;

I22``(2) promote and expand the exchange of information and other forms of mutual assistance between States which are concerned with the same child;

I22``(3) facilitate the enforcement of custody and visitation decrees of sister States;

I22``(4) discourage continuing interstate controversies over child custody in the interest of greater stability of home environment and of secure family relationships for the child;

I22``(5) avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict between State courts in matters of child custody and visitation which have in the past resulted in the shifting of children from State to State with harmful effects on their well-being; and

I22``(6) deter interstate abductions and other unilateral removals of children undertaken to obtain custody and visitation awards.''

I21Pub. L. 103ÿ09383, ÿ1A2, Oct. 20, 1994, 108 Stat. 4063, provided that:

I21``(a) T4FindingsK._The Congress finds that_

I22``(1) there is a large and growing number of child support cases annually involving disputes between parents who reside in different States;

I22``(2) the laws by which the courts of different jurisdictions determine their authority to establish child support orders are not uniform;

I22``(3) those laws, along with the limits imposed by the Federal system on the authority of each State to take certain actions outside its own boundaries_

I23``(A) encourage noncustodial parents to relocate outside the States where their children and the custodial parents reside to avoid the jurisdiction of the courts of such States, resulting in an increase in the amount of interstate travel and communication required to establish and collect on child support orders and a burden on custodial parents that is expensive, time consuming, and disruptive of occupations and commercial activity;

I23``(B) contribute to the pressing problem of relatively low levels of child support payments in interstate cases and to inequities in child support payments levels that are based solely on the noncustodial parent's choice of residence;

I23``(C) encourage a disregard of court orders resulting in massive arrearages nationwide;

I23``(D) allow noncustodial parents to avoid the payment of regularly scheduled child support payments for extensive periods of time, resulting in substantial hardship for the children for whom support is due and for their custodians; and

I23``(E) lead to the excessive relitigation of cases and to the establishment of conflicting orders by the courts of various jurisdictions, resulting in confusion, waste of judicial resources, disrespect for the courts, and a diminution of public confidence in the rule of law; and

I22``(4) among the results of the conditions described in this subsection are_

I23``(A) the failure of the courts of the States to give full faith and credit to the judicial proceedings of the other States;

I23``(B) the deprivation of rights of liberty and property without due process of law;

I23``(C) burdens on commerce among the States; and

I23``(D) harm to the welfare of children and their parents and other custodians.

I21``(b) T4Statement of PolicyK._In view of the findings made in subsection (a), it is necessary to establish national standards under which the courts of the various States shall determine their jurisdiction to issue a child support order and the effect to be given by each State to child support orders issued by the courts of other States.

I21``(c) T4PurposesK._The purposes of this Act [enacting this section and provisions set out as a note under section 1 of this title] are_

I22``(1) to facilitate the enforcement of child support orders among the States;

I22``(2) to discourage continuing interstate controversies over child support in the interest of greater financial stability and secure family relationships for the child; and

I22``(3) to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict among State courts in the establishment of child support orders.''

I74Depositions in Admiralty Cases

I21Prior to the general unification of civil and admiralty procedure and the recision of the Admiralty Rules on July 1, 1966, Revised Statutes ÿ1A863 to 865, as amended, which related to depositions de bene esse, when and how taken, notice, mode of taking, and transmission to court, provided as follows:

I21``T4SecK. 863. The testimony of any witness may be taken in any civil cause depending in a district court by deposition de bene esse, when the witness lives at a greater distance from the place of trial than one hundred miles, or is bound on a voyage to sea, or is about to go out of the United States, or out of the district in which the case is to be tried, and to a greater distance than one hundred miles from the place of trial, before the time of trial, or when he is ancient and infirm. The deposition may be taken before any judge of any court of the United States, or any clerk of a district court, or any chancellor, justice, or judge of a supreme or superior court, mayor or chief magistrate of a city, judge of a county court or court of common pleas of any of the United States, or any notary public, not being of counsel or attorney to either of the parties, nor interested in the event of the cause. Reasonable notice must first be given in writing by the party or his attorney proposing to take such deposition, to the opposite party or his attorney of record, as either may be nearest, which notice shall state the name of the witness and the time and place of the taking of his deposition; and in all cases in rem, the person having the agency or possession of the property at the time of seizure shall be deemed the adverse party, until a claim shall have been put in; and whenever, by reason of the absence from the district and want of an attorney of record or other reason, the giving of the notice herein required shall be impracticable, it shall be lawful to take such depositions as there shall be urgent necessity for taking, upon such notice as any judge authorized to hold courts in such district shall think reasonable and direct. Any person may be compelled to appear and depose as provided by this section, in the same manner as witnesses may be compelled to appear and testify in court.

I21``T4SecK. 864. Every person deposing as provided in the preceding section [R.S. ÿ1A863] shall be cautioned and sworn to testify the whole truth, and carefully examined.

I21``His testimony shall be reduced to writing or typewriting by the officer taking the deposition, or by some person under his personal supervision, or by the deponent himself in the officer's presence, and by no other person, and shall, after it has been reduced to writing or typewriting, be subscribed by the deponent. [As amended May 23, 1900, ch. 541, 31 Stat. 182.]

I21``T4SecK. 865. Every deposition taken under the two preceding sections [R.S. ÿ1A863, 864] shall be retained by the magistrate taking it, until he delivers it with his own hand into the court for which it is taken; or it shall, together with a certificate of the reasons as aforesaid of taking it and of the notice, if any, given to the adverse party, be by him sealed up and directed to such court, and remain under his seal until opened in court. But unless it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the witness is then dead, or gone out of the United States, or to a greater distance than one hundred miles from the place where the court is sitting, or that, by reason of age, sickness, bodily infirmity, or imprisonment, he is unable to travel and appear at court, such deposition shall not be used in the cause.''

I21R.S. ÿ1A863 to 865, as amended, quoted above, were applicable to admiralty proceedings only. Proceedings in bankruptcy and copyright are governed by rule 26 et seq. of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See also Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure set out in the Appendix to Title 11, Bankruptcy.

I89. Transmittal of letter rogatory or request

I11(a) The Department of State has power, directly, or through suitable channels_

I12(1) to receive a letter rogatory issued, or request made, by a foreign or international tribunal, to transmit it to the tribunal, officer, or agency in the United States to whom it is addressed, and to receive and return it after execution; and

I12(2) to receive a letter rogatory issued, or request made, by a tribunal in the United States, to transmit it to the foreign or international tribunal, officer, or agency to whom it is addressed, and to receive and return it after execution.

Q04

I11(b) This section does not preclude_

I12(1) the transmittal of a letter rogatory or request directly from a foreign or international tribunal to the tribunal, officer, or agency in the United States to whom it is addressed and its return in the same manner; or

I12(2) the transmittal of a letter rogatory or request directly from a tribunal in the United States to the foreign or international tribunal, officer, or agency to whom it is addressed and its return in the same manner.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A653 (R.S. ÿ1A875; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, ÿ1A1, 19 Stat. 241; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A291, 36 Stat. 1167).

I21Word ``officer'' was substituted for ``commissioner'' to obviate uncertainty as to the person to whom the letters or commissioned may be issued.

I21The third sentence of section 653 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing for admission of testimony ``so taken and returned'' without objection as to the method of return, was omitted as unnecessary. Obviously, if the method designated by Congress is followed, it cannot be objected to.

I21The last sentence of section 653 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to letters rogatory from courts of foreign countries, is incorporated in section 1782 of this title.

I21The revised section extends the provisions of section 653 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which applied only to cases wherein the United States was a party or was interested, so as to insure a uniform method of taking foreign depositions in all cases.

I21Words ``courts of the United States'' were inserted to make certain that the section is addressed to the Federal rather than the State courts as obviously intended by Congress.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Amendments

I211964_Pub. L. 88ÿ09619 substituted provisions authorizing the Department of State to transmit a letter rogatory or request by a foreign or international tribunal, or by a tribunal in the United States, to the tribunal, officer or agency in the United States or its foreign or international counterpart, to whom addressed, and to return it after execution, and providing that this section does not preclude direct transmission of letters rogatory or requests between interested tribunals, officers or agencies of foreign, international and of United States origin, for provisions authorizing United States ministers or consuls, whenever a United States court issues letters rogatory or a commission to take a deposition, to receive the executed letters or commissions from foreign courts or officers, endorse them with the place and date of receipt and any change in the deposition, and transmit it to the clerk of the issuing court in the same manner as his official dispatches, in text and ``Transmittal of letter rogatory or request'' for ``Foreign witnesses'' in section catchline.

I80ÿ1A1782

I89. Assistance to foreign and international tribunals and to litigants before such tribunals

I11(a) The district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, including criminal investigations conducted before formal accusation. The order may be made pursuant to a letter rogatory issued, or request made, by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the application of any interested person and may direct that the testimony or statement be given, or the document or other thing be produced, before a person appointed by the court. By virtue of his appointment, the person appointed has power to administer any necessary oath and take the testimony or statement. The order may prescribe the practice and procedure, which may be in whole or part the practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal, for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or other thing. To the extent that the order does not prescribe otherwise, the testimony or statement shall be taken, and the document or other thing produced, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I11A person may not be compelled to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing in violation of any legally applicable privilege.

I11(b) This chapter does not preclude a person within the United States from voluntarily giving his testimony or statement, or producing a document or other thing, for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal before any person and in any manner acceptable to him.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 949; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, ÿ1A93, 63 Stat. 103; Pub. L. 88ÿ09619, ÿ1A9(a), Oct. 3, 1964, 78 Stat. 997; Pub. L. 104ÿ09106, div. A, title XIII, ÿ1A1342(b), Feb. 10, 1996, 110 Stat. 486.)

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A649ÿ09653, 701, 703, 704 (R.S. ÿ1A871ÿ09875, 4071, 4073, 4074; Feb. 27, 1877, ch. 69, ÿ1A1, 19 Stat. 241; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A291, 36 Stat. 1167; June 25, 1936, ch. 804, 49 Stat. 1921).

I21Sections 649ÿ09652 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., applied only to the District of Columbia and contained detailed provisions for issuing subpoenas, payment of witness fees and procedure for ordering and taking depositions. These matters are all covered by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 26ÿ0932.

I21Provisions in sections 649ÿ09652 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the taking of testimony in the District of Columbia for use in State and Territorial courts were omitted as covered by section 14ÿ09204 of the District of Columbia Code, 1940 ed., and Rules 26 et seq., and 46 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Only the last sentence of section 653 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is included in this revised section. The remaining provisions relating to depositions of witnesses in foreign countries form the basis of section 1781 of this title.

I21Sections 701, 703, and 704 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were limited to ``suits for the recovery of money or property depending in any court in any foreign country with which the United States are at peace, and in which the government of such foreign country shall be a party or shall have an interest.''

I21The revised section omits this limitation in view of the general application of the last sentence of section 653 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., consolidated herein. The improvement of communications and the expected growth of foreign commerce will inevitably increase litigation involving witnesses separated by wide distances.

I21Therefore the revised section is made simple and clear to provide a flexible procedure for the taking of depositions. The ample safeguards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rules 26ÿ0932, will prevent misuse of this section.

I21The provisions of section 703 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for punishment of disobedience to subpoena or refusal to answer is covered by Rule 37(b)(1) of Federal Rules or Civil Procedure.

I21The provisions of section 704 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with respect to fees and mileage of witnesses are covered by Rule 45(c) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I711949 T4Act

I21This amendment corrects restrictive language in section 1782 of title 28, U.S.C., in conformity with original law and permits depositions in any judicial proceeding without regard to whether the deponent is ``residing'' in the district or only sojourning there.

I89. Subpoena of person in foreign country

I11(a) A court of the United States may order the issuance of a subpoena requiring the appearance as a witness before it, or before a person or body designated by it, of a national or resident of the United States who is in a foreign country, or requiring the production of a specified document or other thing by him, if the court finds that particular testimony or the production of the document or other thing by him is necessary in the interest of justice, and, in other than a criminal action or proceeding, if the court finds, in addition, that it is not possible to obtain his testimony in admissible form without his personal appearance or to obtain the production of the document or other thing in any other manner.

I11(b) The subpoena shall designate the time and place for the appearance or for the production of the document or other thing. Service of the subpoena and any order to show cause, rule, judgment, or decree authorized by this section or by section 1784 of this title shall be effected in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to service of process on a person in a foreign country. The person serving the subpoena shall tender to the person to whom the subpoena is addressed his estimated necessary travel and attendance expenses, the amount of which shall be determined by the court and stated in the order directing the issuance of the subpoena.

I21Words in section 608 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``to which they appear to be entitled on the certificate of attendance'' following the words ``all fees'' and the concluding phrase ``which sum shall be allowed the marshal in the General Accounting Office in his accounts were omitted as unnecessary.''

I21The second paragraph is new. It conforms to Rule 45(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but is inconsistent with Rule 17(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and supersedes that rule as to Federal criminal cases. The Department of Justice suggests that Rule 17(d) is unworkable. To attempt compliance each deputy marshal serving process must carry, on the average, $500 in cash on trips to serve process.

I21The marshal must advance the money from his personal funds. The Comptroller General has not been able to set up any procedure to make it feasible to advance fees to Government witnesses.

I21If a witness is served but fails or refuses to appear, the marshal is out of pocket the money advanced and has no recourse. In the exceptional cases of real necessity, the marshal supplies transportation to an indigent witness under established regulations which protect the disbursement.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I11(a) The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall establish a program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States.

I11(b)(1) The Director shall prescribe, determine, and certify the qualifications of persons who may serve as certified interpreters, when the Director considers certification of interpreters to be merited, for the hearing impaired (whether or not also speech impaired) and persons who speak only or primarily a language other than the English language, in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States. The Director may certify interpreters for any language if the Director determines that there is a need for certified interpreters in that language. Upon the request of the Judicial Conference of the United States for certified interpreters in a language, the Director shall certify interpreters in that language. Upon such a request from the judicial council of a circuit and the approval of the Judicial Conference, the Director shall certify interpreters for that circuit in the language requested. The judicial council of a circuit shall identify and evaluate the needs of the districts within a circuit. The Director shall certify interpreters based on the results of criterion-referenced performance examinations. The Director shall issue regulations to carry out this paragraph within 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act.

I11(2) Only in a case in which no certified interpreter is reasonably available as provided in subsection (d) of this section, including a case in which certification of interpreters is not provided under paragraph (1) in a particular language, may the services of otherwise qualified interpreters be used. The Director shall provide guidelines to the courts for the selection of otherwise qualified interpreters, in order to ensure that the highest standards of accuracy are maintained in all judicial proceedings subject to the provisions of this chapter.

I11(3) The Director shall maintain a current master list of all certified interpreters and otherwise qualified interpreters and shall report periodically on the use and performance of both certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States and on the languages for which interpreters have been certified. The Director shall prescribe, subject to periodic review, a schedule of reasonable fees for services rendered by interpreters, certified or otherwise, used in proceedings instituted by the United States, and in doing so shall consider the prevailing rate of compensation for comparable service in other governmental entities.

I11(c)(1) Each United States district court shall maintain on file in the office of the clerk, and each United States attorney shall maintain on file, a list of all persons who have been certified as interpreters by the Director in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. The clerk shall make the list of certified interpreters for judicial proceeding available upon request.

I11(2) The clerk of the court, or other court employee designated by the chief judge, shall be responsible for securing the services of certified interpreters and otherwise qualified interpreters required for proceedings initiated by the United States, except that the United States attorney is responsible for securing the services of such interpreters for governmental witnesses.

I11(d)(1) The presiding judicial officer, with the assistance of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, shall utilize the services of the most available certified interpreter, or when no certified interpreter is reasonably available, as determined by the presiding judicial officer, the services of an otherwise qualified interpreter, in judicial proceedings instituted by the United States, if the presiding judicial officer determines on such officer's own motion or on the motion of a party that such party (including a defendant in a criminal case), or a witness who may present testimony in such judicial proceedings_

I12(A) speaks only or primarily a language other than the English language; or

I12(B) suffers from a hearing impairment (whether or not suffering also from a speech impairment)

I11(2) Upon the motion of a party, the presiding judicial officer shall determine whether to require the electronic sound recording of a judicial proceeding in which an interpreter is used under this section. In making this determination, the presiding judicial officer shall consider, among other things, the qualifications of the interpreter and prior experience in interpretation of court proceedings; whether the language to be interpreted is not one of the languages for which the Director has certified interpreters, and the complexity or length of the proceeding. In a grand jury proceeding, upon the motion of the accused, the presiding judicial officer shall require the electronic sound recording of the portion of the proceeding in which an interpreter is used.

I11(e)(1) If any interpreter is unable to communicate effectively with the presiding judicial officer, the United States attorney, a party (including a defendant in a criminal case), or a witness, the presiding judicial officer shall dismiss such interpreter and obtain the services of another interpreter in accordance with this section.

I11(2) In any judicial proceedings instituted by the United States, if the presiding judicial officer does not appoint an interpreter under subsection (d) of this section, an individual requiring the services of an interpreter may seek assistance of the clerk of court or the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in obtaining the assistance of a certified interpreter.

I11(f)(1) Any individual other than a witness who is entitled to interpretation under subsection (d) of this section may waive such interpretation in whole or in part. Such a waiver shall be effective only if approved by the presiding judicial officer and made expressly by such individual on the record after opportunity to consult with counsel and after the presiding judicial officer has explained to such individual, utilizing the services of the most available certified interpreter, or when no certified interpreter is reasonably available, as determined by the presiding judicial officer, the services of an otherwise competent interpreter, the nature and effect of the waiver.

I11(2) An individual who waives under paragraph (1) of this subsection the right to an interpreter may utilize the services of a noncertified interpreter of such individual's choice whose fees, expenses, and costs shall be paid in the manner provided for the payment of such fees, expenses, and costs of an interpreter appointed under subsection (d) of this section.

I11(g)(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the Federal judiciary, and to be paid by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, such sums as may be necessary to establish a program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters, and otherwise fulfill the provisions of this section and the Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act, except as provided in paragraph (3).

I11(2) Implementation of the provisions of this section is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds to carry out the purposes of this section.

I11(3) Such salaries, fees, expenses, and costs that are incurred with respect to Government witnesses (including for grand jury proceedings) shall, unless direction is made under paragraph (4), be paid by the Attorney General from sums appropriated to the Department of Justice.

I11(4) Upon the request of any person in any action for which interpreting services established pursuant to subsection (d) are not otherwise provided, the clerk of the court, or other court employee designated by the chief judge, upon the request of the presiding judicial officer, shall, where possible, make such services available to that person on a cost-reimbursable basis, but the judicial officer may also require the prepayment of the estimated expenses of providing such services.

I11(5) If the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts finds it necessary to develop and administer criterion-referenced performance examinations for purposes of certification, or other examinations for the selection of otherwise qualified interpreters, the Director may prescribe for each examination a uniform fee for applicants to take such examination. In determining the rate of the fee for each examination, the Director shall consider the fees charged by other organizations for examinations that are similar in scope or nature. Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of title 31, the Director is authorized to provide in any contract or agreement for the development or administration of examinations and the collection of fees that the contractor may retain all or a portion of the fees in payment for the services. Notwithstanding paragraph (6) of this subsection, all fees collected after the effective date of this paragraph and not retained by a contractor shall be deposited in the fund established under section 1931 of this title and shall remain available until expended.

I11(6) Any moneys collected under this subsection may be used to reimburse the appropriations obligated and disbursed in payment for such services.

I11(h) The presiding judicial officer shall approve the compensation and expenses payable to interpreters, pursuant to the schedule of fees prescribed by the Director under subsection (b)(3).

I11(j) The term ``judicial proceedings instituted by the United States'' as used in this section refers to all proceedings, whether criminal or civil, including pretrial and grand jury proceedings (as well as proceedings upon a petition for a writ of habeas corpus initiated in the name of the United States by a relator) conducted in, or pursuant to the lawful authority and jurisdiction of a United States district court. The term ``United States district court'' as used in this subsection includes any court which is created by an Act of Congress in a territory and is invested with any jurisdiction of a district court established by chapter 5 of this title.

I11(k) The interpretation provided by certified or otherwise qualified interpreters pursuant to this section shall be in the simultaneous mode for any party to a judicial proceeding instituted by the United States and in the consecutive mode for witnesses, except that the presiding judicial officer, sua sponte or on the motion of a party, may authorize a simultaneous, or consecutive interpretation when such officer determines after a hearing on the record that such interpretation will aid in the efficient administration of justice. The presiding judicial officer, on such officer's motion or on the motion of a party, may order that special interpretation services as authorized in section 1828 of this title be provided if such officer determines that the provision of such services will aid in the efficient administration of justice.

I11(T3lK) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or section 1828, the presiding judicial officer may appoint a certified or otherwise qualified sign language interpreter to provide services to a party, witness, or other participant in a judicial proceeding, whether or not the proceeding is instituted by the United States, if the presiding judicial officer determines, on such officer's own motion or on the motion of a party or other participant in the proceeding, that such individual suffers from a hearing impairment. The presiding judicial officer shall, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, approve the compensation and expenses payable to sign language interpreters appointed under this section in accordance with the schedule of fees prescribed by the Director under subsection (b)(3) of this section.

I80ÿ1A1863

I89. Plan for random jury selection

I11(a) Each United States district court shall devise and place into operation a written plan for random selection of grand and petit jurors that shall be designed to achieve the objectives of sections 1861 and 1862 of this title, and that shall otherwise comply with the provisions of this title. The plan shall be placed into operation after approval by a reviewing panel consisting of the members of the judicial council of the circuit and either the chief judge of the district whose plan is being reviewed or such other active district judge of that district as the chief judge of the district may designate. The panel shall examine the plan to ascertain that it complies with the provisions of this title. If the reviewing panel finds that the plan does not comply, the panel shall state the particulars in which the plan fails to comply and direct the district court to present within a reasonable time an alternative plan remedying the defect or defects. Separate plans may be adopted for each division or combination of divisions within a judicial district. The district court may modify a plan at any time and it shall modify the plan when so directed by the reviewing panel. The district court shall promptly notify the panel, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and the Attorney General of the United States, of the initial adoption and future modifications of the plan by filing copies therewith. Modifications of the plan made at the instance of the district court shall become effective after approval by the panel. Each district court shall submit a report on the jury selection process within its jurisdiction to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in such form and at such times as the Judicial Conference of the United States may specify. The Judicial Conference of the United States may, from time to time, adopt rules and regulations governing the provisions and the operation of the plans formulated under this title.

I11(b) Among other things, such plan shall_

I12(1) either establish a jury commission, or authorize the clerk of the court, to manage the jury selection process. If the plan establishes a jury commission, the district court shall appoint one citizen to serve with the clerk of the court as the jury commission: T3Provided, howeverK, That the plan for the District of Columbia may establish a jury commission consisting of three citizens. The citizen jury commissioner shall not belong to the same political party as the clerk serving with him. The clerk or the jury commission, as the case may be, shall act under the supervision and control of the chief judge of the district court or such other judge of the district court as the plan may provide. Each jury commissioner shall, during his tenure in office, reside in the judicial district or division for which he is appointed. Each citizen jury commissioner shall receive compensation to be fixed by the district court plan at a rate not to exceed $50 per day for each day necessarily employed in the performance of his duties, plus reimbursement for travel, subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred by him in the performance of such duties. The Judicial Conference of the United States may establish standards for allowance of travel, subsistence, and other necessary expenses incurred by jury commissioners.

I12(2) specify whether the names of prospective jurors shall be selected from the voter registration lists or the lists of actual voters of the political subdivisions within the district or division. The plan shall prescribe some other source or sources of names in addition to voter lists where necessary to foster the policy and protect the rights secured by sections 1861 and 1862 of this title. The plan for the District of Columbia may require the names of prospective jurors to be selected from the city directory rather than from voter lists. The plans for the districts of Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone may prescribe some other source or sources of names of prospective jurors in lieu of voter lists, the use of which shall be consistent with the policies declared and rights secured by sections 1861 and 1862 of this title. The plan for the district of Massachusetts may require the names of prospective jurors to be selected from the resident list provided for in chapter 234A, Massachusetts General Laws, or comparable authority, rather than from voter lists.

I12(3) specify detailed procedures to be followed by the jury commission or clerk in selecting names from the sources specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection. These procedures shall be designed to ensure the random selection of a fair cross section of the persons residing in the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes. They shall ensure that names of persons residing in each of the counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions within the judicial district or division are placed in a master jury wheel; and shall ensure that each county, parish, or similar political subdivision within the district or division is substantially proportionally represented in the master jury wheel for that judicial district, division, or combination of divisions. For the purposes of determining proportional representation in the master jury wheel, either the number of actual voters at the last general election in each county, parish, or similar political subdivision, or the number of registered voters if registration of voters is uniformly required throughout the district or division, may be used.

I12(4) provide for a master jury wheel (or a device similar in purpose and function) into which the names of those randomly selected shall be placed. The plan shall fix a minimum number of names to be placed initially in the master jury wheel, which shall be at least one-half of 1 per centum of the total number of persons on the lists used as a source of names for the district or division; but if this number of names is believed to be cumbersome and unnecessary, the plan may fix a smaller number of names to be placed in the master wheel, but in no event less than one thousand. The chief judge of the district court, or such other district court judge as the plan may provide, may order additional names to be placed in the master jury wheel from time to time as necessary. The plan shall provide for periodic emptying and refilling of the master jury wheel at specified times, the interval for which shall not exceed four years.

I12(5)(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), specify those groups of persons or occupational classes whose members shall, on individual request therefor, be excused from jury service. Such groups or classes shall be excused only if the district court finds, and the plan states, that jury service by such class or group would entail undue hardship or extreme inconvenience to the members thereof, and excuse of members thereof would not be inconsistent with sections 1861 and 1862 of this title.

I12(B) specify that volunteer safety personnel, upon individual request, shall be excused from jury service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``volunteer safety personnel'' means individuals serving a public agency (as defined in section 1203(6) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968ÿ1A\1\N) in an official capacity, without compensation, as firefighters or members of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.

I28N\1\ÿ1ASee References in Text note below.

I12(6) specify that the following persons are barred from jury service on the ground that they are exempt: (A) members in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States; (B) members of the fire or police departments of any State, the District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United States, or any subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or such territory or possession; (C) public officers in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the Government of the United States, or of any State, the District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United States, or any subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or such territory or possession, who are actively engaged in the performance of official duties.

I12(7) fix the time when the names drawn from the qualified jury wheel shall be disclosed to parties and to the public. If the plan permits these names to be made public, it may nevertheless permit the chief judge of the district court, or such other district court judge as the plan may provide, to keep these names confidential in any case where the interests of justice so require.

I12(8) specify the procedures to be followed by the clerk or jury commission in assigning persons whose names have been drawn from the qualified jury wheel to grand and petit jury panels.

Q04

I11(c) The initial plan shall be devised by each district court and transmitted to the reviewing panel specified in subsection (a) of this section within one hundred and twenty days of the date of enactment of the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968. The panel shall approve or direct the modification of each plan so submitted within sixty days thereafter. Each plan or modification made at the direction of the panel shall become effective after approval at such time thereafter as the panel directs, in no event to exceed ninety days from the date of approval. Modifications made at the instance of the district court under subsection (a) of this section shall be effective at such time thereafter as the panel directs, in no event to exceed ninety days from the date of modification.

I11(d) State, local, and Federal officials having custody, possession, or control of voter registration lists, lists of actual voters, or other appropriate records shall make such lists and records available to the jury commission or clerks for inspection, reproduction, and copying at all reasonable times as the commission or clerk may deem necessary and proper for the performance of duties under this title. The district courts shall have jurisdiction upon application by the Attorney General of the United States to compel compliance with this subsection by appropriate process.

I89. Drawing of names from the master jury wheel; completion of juror qualification form

I11(a) From time to time as directed by the district court, the clerk or a district judge shall draw at random from the master jury wheel the names of as many persons as may be required for jury service. The clerk or jury commission shall post a general notice for public review in the clerk's office and on the court's website explaining the process by which names are periodically and randomly drawn. The clerk or jury commission may, upon order of the court, prepare an alphabetical list of the names drawn from the master jury wheel. Any list so prepared shall not be disclosed to any person except pursuant to the district court plan or pursuant to section 1867 or 1868 of this title. The clerk or jury commission shall mail to every person whose name is drawn from the master wheel a juror qualification form accompanied by instructions to fill out and return the form, duly signed and sworn, to the clerk or jury commission by mail within ten days. If the person is unable to fill out the form, another shall do it for him, and shall indicate that he has done so and the reason therefor. In any case in which it appears that there is an omission, ambiguity, or error in a form, the clerk or jury commission shall return the form with instructions to the person to make such additions or corrections as may be necessary and to return the form to the clerk or jury commission within ten days. Any person who fails to return a completed juror qualification form as instructed may be summoned by the clerk or jury commission forthwith to appear before the clerk or jury commission to fill out a juror qualification form. A person summoned to appear because of failure to return a juror qualification form as instructed who personally appears and executes a juror qualification form before the clerk or jury commission may, at the discretion of the district court, except where his prior failure to execute and mail such form was willful, be entitled to receive for such appearance the same fees and travel allowances paid to jurors under section 1871 of this title. At the time of his appearance for jury service, any person may be required to fill out another juror qualification form in the presence of the jury commission or the clerk or the court, at which time, in such cases as it appears warranted, the person may be questioned, but only with regard to his responses to questions contained on the form.

I11(g) Any person summoned for jury service who fails to appear as directed may be ordered by the district court to appear forthwith and show cause for failure to comply with the summons. Any person who fails to show good cause for noncompliance with a summons may be fined not more than $1,000, imprisoned not more than three days, ordered to perform community service, or any combination thereof.

I11(4) In no event shall a prisoner be prohibited from bringing a civil action or appealing a civil or criminal judgment for the reason that the prisoner has no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.

I12(B) the action or appeal_

I13(i) is frivolous or malicious;

I89. United States marshal's fees

I11(a)(1) The United States marshals or deputy marshals shall routinely collect, and a court may tax as costs, fees for the following:

I12(A) Serving a writ of possession, partition, execution, attachment in rem, or libel in admiralty, warrant, attachment, summons, complaints, or any other writ, order or process in any case or proceeding.

I12(B) Serving a subpoena or summons for a witness or appraiser.

I12(C) Forwarding any writ, order, or process to another judicial district for service.

I12(D) The preparation of any notice of sale, proclamation in admiralty, or other public notice or bill of sale.

I12(E) The keeping of attached property (including boats, vessels, or other property attached or libeled), actual expenses incurred, such as storage, moving, boat hire, or other special transportation, watchmen's or keepers' fees, insurance, and an hourly rate, including overtime, for each deputy marshal required for special services, such as guarding, inventorying, and moving.

I12(F) Copies of writs or other papers furnished at the request of any party.

I12(G) Necessary travel in serving or endeavoring to serve any process, writ, or order, except in the District of Columbia, with mileage to be computed from the place where service is returnable to the place of service or endeavor.

I12(H) Overtime expenses incurred by deputy marshals in the course of serving or executing civil process.

Q04

I11(2) The marshals shall collect, in advance, a deposit to cover the initial expenses for special services required under paragraph (1)(E), and periodically thereafter such amounts as may be necessary to pay such expenses until the litigation is concluded. This paragraph applies to all private litigants, including seamen proceeding pursuant to section 1916 of this title.

I11(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(G), if two or more services or endeavors, or if an endeavor and a service, are made in behalf of the same party in the same case on the same trip, mileage shall be computed to the place of service or endeavor which is most remote from the place where service is returnable, adding thereto any additional mileage traveled in serving or endeavoring to serve in behalf of the party. If two or more writs of any kind, required to be served in behalf of the same party on the same person in the same case or proceeding, may be served at the same time, mileage on only one such writ shall be collected.

I11(b) The Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe by regulation the fees to be taxed and collected under subsection (a). Such fees shall, to the extent practicable, reflect the actual and reasonable cost of the service provided.

I11(c)(1) The United States Marshals Service shall collect a commission of 3 percent of the first $1,000 collected and 1\1/2\ percent on the excess of any sum over $1,000, for seizing or levying on property (including seizures in admiralty), disposing of such property by sale, setoff, or otherwise, and receiving and paying over money, except that the amount of commission shall be within the range set by the Attorney General. ifÿ1A\1\N the property is not disposed of by marshal's sale, the commission shall be in such amount, within the range set by the Attorney General, as may be allowed by the court. In any case in which the vessel or other property is sold by a public auctioneer, or by some party other than a marshal or deputy marshal, the commission authorized under this subsection shall be reduced by the amount paid to such auctioneer or other party. This subsection applies to any judicially ordered sale or execution sale, without regard to whether the judicial order of sale constitutes a seizure or levy within the meaning of State law. This subsection shall not apply to any seizure, forfeiture, sale, or other disposition of property pursuant to the applicable provisions of law amended by the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 2040).

I21Provisions for serving venires and summoning grand and petit jurors were omitted as useless since marshal's fees are now covered into the Treasury and there is no basis for apportioning the cost of summoning jurors for a term of court and taxing the same to individual cases.

I21The marshal's fee ``for holding a court of inquiry or other proceedings before a jury, including summoning a jury, $5'' is omitted as obsolete in the Federal practice. See, Black's Law Dictionary ``Court of Inquiry.'' See, also, Webster's International Dictionary.

I21A fee of 50 cents ``for each bail bond'' is omitted as covered by the general provision for taxation of marshal's fees in criminal cases.

I21The provisions for a fee of $5 for drawing and executing a deed and $1 for executing a deed prepared by a party or his attorney are omitted as unnecessary. It is the marshal's duty to execute conveyances of property which he sells on execution and his salary compensates him therefor. There is no occasion for him to draw such a deed and no beneficial purpose in taxing the parties a fee for his signature.

I21The 2 per centum fee for disbursing moneys is omitted as an unnecessary burden upon funds belonging to litigants.

I21The provision that a folio consists of ``100 words or major fraction thereof'' is inserted to conform with section 607 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which is transferred to title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents, along with section 606 of said title 28, to which said section 607 also relates.

I21The provision for a lump sum to be determined by the court and taxed in criminal cases was added. It fixes a maximum of $25 in misdemeanor cases and $100 in felony cases. It may be questioned whether costs as such should ever be taxed against the convicted defendant in a criminal case. The acquitted defendant is not permitted to tax costs against the United States. Indeed the allowance of costs in criminal cases is not a matter of right but rests completely within the discretion of the court. T3Morris v. United StatesK, 1911, 185 Fed. 73, 107 C.C.A. 293.

I21In T3Alberty v.

Costs of prosecution were taxed in the sum of $1,499.80. Yet the court in its discretion might have reached substantially the same result by imposing a fine of $200 on each count without any taxation of costs.

I21Section consolidates sections 571, 572, and 578 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21The phrase ``$20 on trial or final hearing in civil, criminal, or admiralty cases'' was substituted for the following provisions of section 572 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``On trial before a jury, in civil or criminal causes or before referees, or on a final hearing in equity or admiralty, a docket fee of $20'', and the limitation of $10 in ``cases at law when judgment is rendered without a jury'' was omitted. This simplified restatement provides for a single docket fee in each case which reaches final hearing or trial. Since the docket fee is arbitrary, any limitation or distinction between law cases tried with or without a jury is unrealistic.

I21Word ``solicitor'' was omitted as obsolete and inapplicable in civil, criminal, or admiralty practice.

I21Words ``motion for judgment'' were substituted for ``scire facias'' to conform to Rules 2 and 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This section follows the recommendation of the Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (1937) which included the following rule:

I21``Rule 77. T4Registration of judgments in other district courtsK. A judgment entered in any district court and which has become final through expiration of the time for appeal or by mandate on appeal may be registered in any other district court by filing therein an authenticated copy of the judgment. When so registered the judgment shall have the same effect and like proceedings for its enforcement may be taken thereon in the court in which it is registered as if the judgment had been originally entered by that court. If in the court in which the judgment was originally entered, the judgment has been satisfied in whole or in part or if an order has been made modifying or vacating it or affecting or suspending its operation, the party procuring the registration shall and any other party may file authenticated copies of the satisfaction or order with the court in which the judgment is registered. This rule shall not be construed to limit the effect of the Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592, ÿ1A20 (33 Stat. 729), as amended, U.S.C., title 15, ÿ1A100; or the Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320, ÿ1A36 and 37 (35 Stat. 1084), U.S.C., title 17, ÿ1A36 and 37; or ÿ1A56 of the Judicial Code, U.S.C., title 28, ÿ1A117; or to authorize the registration elsewhere of an order or a judgment rendered in a divorce action in the District of Columbia.''

I21Section 2508 of this title provides for the registration of judgments of the Court of Claims in favor of the United States in any district. See, also, section 2413 of this title.

I21The phrase ``for the recovery of money or property'' was not in the committee's draft of Rule 77 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but was inserted in the revised section to exclude judgments in divorce actions, and any other actions, the registration of which would serve no useful purpose.

I11(a) Any realty or interest therein sold under any order or decree of any court of the United States shall be sold as a whole or in separate parcels at public sale at the courthouse of the county, parish, or city in which the greater part of the property is located, or upon the premises or some parcel thereof located therein, as the court directs. Such sale shall be upon such terms and conditions as the court directs.

I11Property in the possession of a receiver or receivers appointed by one or more district courts shall be sold at public sale in the district wherein any such receiver was first appointed, at the courthouse of the county, parish, or city situated therein in which the greater part of the property in such district is located, or on the premises or some parcel thereof located in such county, parish, or city, as such court directs, unless the court orders the sale of the property or one or more parcels thereof in one or more ancillary districts.

I11(b) After a hearing, of which notice to all interested parties shall be given by publication or otherwise as the court directs, the court may order the sale of such realty or interest or any part thereof at private sale for cash or other consideration and upon such terms and conditions as the court approves, if it finds that the best interests of the estate will be conserved thereby. Before confirmation of any private sale, the court shall appoint three disinterested persons to appraise such property or different groups of three appraisers each to appraise properties of different classes or situated in different localities. No private sale shall be confirmed at a price less than two-thirds of the appraised value. Before confirmation of any private sale, the terms thereof shall be published in such newspaper or newspapers of general circulation as the court directs at least ten days before confirmation. The private sale shall not be confirmed if a bona fide offer is made, under conditions prescribed by the court, which guarantees at least a 10 per centum increase over the price offered in the private sale.

I11(c) This section shall not apply to sales and proceedings under Title 11 or by receivers or conservators of banks appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency.

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A849 (Mar. 3, 1893, ch. 225, ÿ1A3, 27 Stat. 751; Apr. 24, 1935, ch. 77, ÿ1A3, 49 Stat. 160; June 19, 1935, ch. 276, 49 Stat. 390).

I21A provision making the section applicable to pending proceedings was deleted as obsolete.

I21Word ``under'' was substituted for ``ordered pursuant to section 847 of this title by'' after ``A public sale of realty or interest therein''.

I21Sections 847 and 848, of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., now sections 2001 and 2004 of this title, relate only to sales under orders or decrees, without any reference to sales under judgments. In 1921 the Supreme Court held, in T3Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. City of ClarksdaleK, 1921, 42 S.Ct. 27, 257 U.S. 10, 66 L.Ed. 104, that such section 847 did not apply to sales under common law executions. At that time such section 849 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., read as it has been revised above, without any reference to such section 847. However, in 1935, such sections 847, 848 and 849 were amended by one act, ch. 77, 49 Stat. 159, and, in such section 849, the words ``pursuant to the provisions of this Act'' were inserted, but the word ``judgment,'' though retained in such section 849, was not inserted in such sections 847 and 848. It is probable that Congress did not intend, in 1935 to make such sections 847 and 848 applicable to sales under judgments in law actions. Hence, to make all three sections consistent, the above-mentioned substitution was made.

I21Reference to circuit was deleted from first and second paragraphs as unnecessary and inappropriate. Publication in a newspaper in a large circuit remote from the county in which the realty is situate, might be wholly insufficient to give notice to interested parties.

I11Whenever any such contingency arises after a marshal has sold any realty or interest therein and before a deed is executed, the court may, on application by the purchaser, or the plaintiff in whose action the sale was made, setting forth the facts of the case and the reason why the title was not perfected by such marshal, order the succeeding marshal to perfect the title and execute a deed to the purchaser, upon payment of the purchase money and unpaid costs.

I11The United States marshal shall summon the appraisers in the same manner as the sheriff is required to summon appraisers under State law.

I11If the appraisers fail to attend and perform their required duties, the marshal may sell the goods without an appraisal. Appraisers attending and performing their duties, shall receive the fees allowed for appraisals under State law.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I711948 T4Act

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A219, 263, 296, 307, 723, 731, and 761, and section 1111 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Internal Revenue Code (R.S. ÿ1A913, 918; Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 359, ÿ1A4, 24 Stat. 506; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A122, 157, 194, 291, 297, 36 Stat. 1132, 1139, 1145, 1167, 1168; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A187(a), as added Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 843, ÿ1A1, 54 Stat. 1101; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, ÿ1A13, 43 Stat. 941; Mar. 2, 1929, ch. 488, ÿ1A1, 45 Stat. 1475; Feb. 10, 1939, ch. 2, ÿ1A1111, 53 Stat. 160; Oct. 21, 1942, ch. 619, title V, ÿ1A504(a), (c), 56 Stat. 957).

I21Sections 219, 263, 296, 307, 723, and 731 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., gave specified courts, other than the Supreme Court, power to make rules. Section 761 of such title related to rules established in the district courts and Court of Claims. Section 1111 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., related to Tax Court. This section consolidates all such provisions. For other provisions of such sections, see Distribution Table.

I21Recognition by Congress of the broad rule-making power of the courts will make it possible for the courts to prescribe complete and uniform modes of procedure, and alleviate, at least in part, the necessity of searching in two places, namely in the Acts of Congress and in the rules of the courts, for procedural requisites.

I21Former Attorney General Cummings recently said: ``Legislative bodies have neither the time to inquire objectively into the details of judicial procedure nor the opportunity to determine the necessity for amendment or change. Frequently such legislation has been enacted for the purpose of meeting particular problems or supposed difficulties, but the results have usually been confusing or otherwise unsatisfactory. Comprehensive action has been lacking for the obvious reason that the professional nature of the task would leave the legislature little time for matters of substance and statesmanship. It often happened that an admitted need for change, even in limited areas, could not be secured.''_The New Criminal Rules_Another Triumph of the Democratic Process. American Bar Association Journal, May 1945.

I21Provisions of sections 263 and 296 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the Court of Claims and Customs Court to punish for contempt, were omitted as covered by H. R. 1600, ÿ1A401, 80th Congress, for revision of the Criminal Code.

I21Provisions of section 1111 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., making applicable to Tax Court Proceedings ``the rules of evidence applicable in the courts of the District of Columbia in the type of proceeding which, prior to Sept. 16, 1938, were within the jurisdiction of the courts of equity of said District,'' were omitted as unnecessary and inconsistent with other provisions of law relating to the Federal courts. The rules of evidence in Tax Court proceedings are the same as those which apply to civil procedure in other courts. See T3Dempster Mill. Mfg. Co. v. BurnetK, 1931, 46 F.2d 604, 60 App.D.C. 23.

I21For rule-making power of the Supreme Court in copyright infringement actions, see section 25(e) of title 17, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Copyrights. See, also, section 205(a) of title 11, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Bankruptcy, authorizing the Supreme Court to promulgate rules relating to service of process in railroad reorganization proceedings.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated. Therefore, section 1111 of Title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, was not one of the sources of this section as finally enacted. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A47, 47a, 349a, 350, 380, 380a, section 29 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 45 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation (Feb. 11, 1903, ch. 544, ÿ1A2, 32 Stat. 1167; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A210, 266, 291, 36 Stat. 1150, 1162, 1167; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 160, 37 Stat. 1013; Oct. 22, 1913, ch. 32, 38 Stat. 220; Sept. 6, 1916, ch. 448, ÿ1A6, 39 Stat. 727; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, ÿ1A1, 8 (a, b, d), 43 Stat. 938, 940; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, ÿ1A1, 45 Stat. 54; June 7, 1934, ch. 426, 48 Stat. 936; Aug. 24, 1937, ch. 754, ÿ1A2, 3, 50 Stat. 752; June 9, 1944, ch. 239, 58 Stat. 272).

I21Section consolidates section 350 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with those portions of sections 47, 47a, 349a, 380, and 380a, of said title 28, section 29, of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 45 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respective time for taking direct appeal. (For disposition of other provisions of said sections, see Distribution Table.)

I21Subsection (a) of the revised section is derived from sections 349a and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The phrase ``under rules prescribed by the Supreme Court'' was substituted for the phrase ``under such rules as may be prescribed by the proper courts'' which appeared in both such sections. The Supreme Court by its revised rules 10ÿ0913 has made adequate provision for filing record and docketing case. (See Revised Rules of the Supreme Court following section 354 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.)

I21Subsection (b) is in accord with sections 47 and 47a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 29 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 45 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation.

I21Subsection (c), with respect to the time for taking other appeals or petitioning for a writ of certiorari, substitutes, as more specific, the words ``ninety days'' for the words ``three months'' contained in section 350 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed. The provision in said section 350 for allowance of additional time was retained, notwithstanding the language of the Supreme Court in T3Comm'r v. Bedford's EstateK, 1945, 65 S.Ct. 1157, 1159, 325 U.S. 283, 89 L.Ed. 1611, to the effect that the 3 months' period is ``more than ample *** to determine whether to seek further review''.

I21In subsection (c), words ``in a civil action, suit, or proceeding'' were added because section 350 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was superseded as to criminal cases by Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 39(a)(2), (b)(2).

I21Words ``or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia'' in section 350 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as covered by ``court of appeals'' in subsection (d) of this revised section.

I21Words in section 350 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ``excepting that writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands may be granted where application therefor is made within six months'', were omitted as obsolete, in view of the independence of the Philippines recognized by section 1240 of title 48, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Territories and Insular Possessions.

I21Subsection (e) relates only to supersedeas or stay of execution of judgments sought to be reviewed in the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari. Supersedeas or stay of proceedings taken to the Supreme Court by appeal from courts of appeals, or direct appeals from a district court or three-judge courts, is governed by Rule 62 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I711949 T4Act

I21This section clarifies the meaning of subsection (c) of section 2101 of title 28, U.S.C. At present, such subsection, after the words, ``ninety days after entry of such judgment or decree'', reads, ``unless, upon application for writ of certiorari, for good cause, the Supreme Court or a justice thereof allows an additional time not exceeding sixty days.''

I21The new subsection (d) of section 2101 supplies an omission in revised title 28, U.S.C., and confirms the authority of the Supreme Court to regulate the time for seeking review of State criminal cases.

I21The other amendment merely renumbers subsections (d) and (e) of such section 2101 as subsections (e) and (f), respectively.

I74Amendments

I211994_Subsec. (g). Pub. L. 103ÿ09337 substituted ``Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces'' for ``Court of Military Appeals''.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Amendments

I211988_Pub. L. 100ÿ09352 substituted ``Reviews of State court decisions'' for ``Appeals from State courts'' in section catchline and amended text generally.

I74Effective Date of T11988K Amendment

I21Amendment by Pub.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 963.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A879 (R.S. ÿ1A1011; Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80, ÿ1A1, 18 Stat. 318).

I21The revised language is substituted for the provisions of section 879 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to avoid any construction that matters of fact are not reviewable in nonjury cases. Such section 879 related to review upon a writ of error which applied only to actions at law. (See Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure limiting the review of questions of fact which renders unnecessary any statutory limitation.)

I21Rule 7(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure abolished all pleas, and the rules adopted the motion as a substitute therefor.

I21Words ``matters in abatement'' were, therefore, substituted for the abolished ``plea in abatement'' and ``plea to the jurisdiction.''

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A344, 876, 877 (R.S. ÿ1A701; Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, ÿ1A10, 11, 26 Stat. 829; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A231, 236, 237, 291, 36 Stat. 1156, 1167; Dec. 23, 1914, ch. 2, 38 Stat. 790; Sept. 16, 1916, ch. 448, ÿ1A2, 39 Stat. 726; Feb. 17, 1922, ch. 54, 42 Stat. 366; Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, ÿ1A1, 43 Stat. 937; Jan. 31, 1928, ch. 14, ÿ1A1, 45 Stat. 54).

I21Words ``or a court of appeals'' were inserted after ``Supreme Court'' upon authority of T3United States v. Illinois Surety CoK., C.C.A. 1915, 226 F. 653, affirmed 37 S.Ct. 614, 244 U.S. 376, 61 L.Ed. 1206, wherein it was held that this section also applied to the courts of appeals in view of section 11 of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, 28 Stat. 829.

I21The revised section will cover instances where the Supreme Court remands a case to the highest court of a State and to the United States Tax Court. It will also cover a remand of a case to the Court of Claims or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. For authority to remand a case to The Tax Court, see T3Equitable Life Assurance Society of U.S. v. Commissioner of Internal RevenueK, 1944, 64 S.Ct. 722, 321 U.S. 560, 88 L.Ed. 927.

I21Revised section will also permit a remand by the Supreme Court to a court of appeals inasmuch as such latter court then would be a lower court. The revised section is in conformity with numerous holdings of the Supreme Court to the effect that such a remand may be made. See especially, T3Maryland Casualty Co. v. United StatesK, 1929, 49 S.Ct. 484, 279 U.S. 792, 73 L.Ed. 960; T3Krauss Bros. Co. v. MellonK, 1928, 48 S.Ct. 358, 276 U.S. 386, 72 L.Ed. 620 and T3Buzyuski v. Luckenbach S. S. CoK., 1928, 48 S.Ct. 440, 277 U.S. 226, 72 L.Ed. 860.

I21The last sentence of section 876 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., providing that the Supreme Court should not issue execution but should send a special mandate to the inferior court to award execution, was omitted. See rule 34 of the revised rules of the Supreme Court relating to Mandates, and section 1651 of this title authorizing the Supreme Court to issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I89. Time for appeal to court of appeals

I11(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no appeal shall bring any judgment, order or decree in an action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal is filed, within thirty days after the entry of such judgment, order or decree.

I11(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the time as to all parties shall be 60 days from such entry if one of the parties is_

I11(c) The district court may, upon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. In addition, if the district court finds_

I12(1) that a party entitled to notice of the entry of a judgment or order did not receive such notice from the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry, and

I12(2) that no party would be prejudiced,

Q04

I10the district court may, upon motion filed within 180 days after entry of the judgment or order or within 14 days after receipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.

I11(d) This section shall not apply to bankruptcy matters or other proceedings under Title 11.

I21Section 1142 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., provided for 3 months within which to petition for appeal from a decision of The Tax Court. The second paragraph of the revised section reduces this to 60 days for reasons explained above. Other provisions of said section 1142 making a distinction between decisions before and after June 6, 1932, were omitted as executed.

I21Words ``in an action, suit, or proceeding of a civil nature'' were added in view of Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure prescribing a different limitation for criminal appeals.

I21Words ``notice of appeal is filed'' were substituted for provisions of sections 230 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and 1142 of title 26, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for petition and allowance of appeal in order to eliminate the useless paper work involved in a pro forma application for appeal and perfunctory allowance of the same. The effect of the section is to require appeals to the courts of appeals in all cases to be taken by filing notice of appeal. See Rule 73(b) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21The case of T3Mosier v. Federal Reserve Bank of New YorkK, C.C.A. 1942, 132 F.2d 710, holds that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure changing the method of ``taking'' an appeal, do not affect the time limitation prescribed by section 230 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Word ``order'' was added, in two places, after ``judgment'' so as to make the section cover all appeals of which the courts of appeals have jurisdiction, as set forth in section 1291 et seq. of this title.

I21The last paragraph was added in conformity with section 48 of title 11, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Bankruptcy, and other sections of that title regulating appellate procedure in bankruptcy matters.

I21The third paragraph was inserted to conform to the existing practice in Admiralty upon the recommendation of the Committee on the Federal Courts of the New York County Lawyers Association.

I21The time for appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in patent and trade-mark cases is governed by section 89 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 60 of title 35, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Patents, and Rule 25 of the Rules of such court, and, in customs cases, by section 2601 of this title.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I74Senate Revision Amendment

I21By Senate amendment, all provisions relating to the Tax Court were eliminated. Therefore, section 1142 of title 26, U.S.C., Internal Revenue Code, was not one of the sources of this section as finally enacted. However, no change in the text of this section was necessary. See 80th Congress Senate Report No. 1559.

I711949 T4Act

I21This amendment to section 2107 of title 28, U.S.C., restores the former 15-day limitation of time within which to appeal from an interlocutory order in admiralty.

I21This amendment eliminates as surplusage the words ``in any such action, suit or proceeding,'' from the fourth paragraph of section 2107 of title 28, U.S.C., and corrects a typographical error in the same paragraph.

I74Amendments

I212011_Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 112ÿ0962 added subsec. (b) and struck out former subsec. (b) which read as follows: ``In any such action, suit or proceeding in which the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, the time as to all parties shall be sixty days from such entry.''

I212009_Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 111ÿ0916 substituted ``within 14 days'' for ``within 7 days'' in concluding provisions.

I211991_Pub. L. 102ÿ09198 designated first and second pars. as subsecs. (a) and (b), respectively, added subsec. (c), designated fifth par. as subsec. (d), and struck out third and fourth pars. which read as follows:

I21``In any action, suit or proceeding in admiralty, the notice of appeal shall be filed within ninety days after the entry of the order, judgment or decree appealed from, if it is a final decision, and within fifteen days after its entry if it is an interlocutory decree.

I21``The district court may extend the time for appeal not exceeding thirty days from the expiration of the original time herein prescribed, upon a showing of excusable neglect based on failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment, order or decree.''

I211978_Pub. L. 95ÿ09598 directed the amendment of section by inserting ``or the bankruptcy court'' after ``district court'' and by striking out the final par., which amendment did not become effective pursuant to section 402(b) of Pub. L. 95ÿ09598, as amended, set out as an Effective Date note preceding section 101 of Title 11, Bankruptcy.

I211949_Act May 24, 1949, restored, in third par., the 15-day limitation of time within which to appeal from an interlocutory order in admiralty, and in fourth par., substituted ``The district court may'' for ``The district court, in any such action, suit, or proceeding, may'' and corrected spelling of ``excusable''.

I74Findings

I21Pub. L. 112ÿ0962, ÿ1A2, Nov. 29, 2011, 125 Stat. 756, provided that: ``Congress finds that_

I22``(1) section 2107 of title 28, United States Code, and rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that the time to appeal for most civil actions is 30 days, but that the appeal time for all parties is 60 days when the parties in the civil action include the United States, a United States officer, or a United States agency;

I89. Proof of amount in controversy

I11Where the power of any court of appeals to review a case depends upon the amount or value in controversy, such amount or value, if not otherwise satisfactorily disclosed upon the record, may be shown and ascertained by the oath of a party to the case or by other competent evidence.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 963.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A231 (Feb. 13, 1925, ch. 229, ÿ1A9, 43 Stat. 941).

I21Words ``or in the Supreme Court'' were omitted. Section 7 of the 1925 act containing such words related to review by the Supreme Court of the United States of decisions of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands and designated a certain jurisdictional amount. Such section 7 has now become obsolete, in view of the recognition of the independence of the Philippines, title 48 U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A1240, Territories and Insular Possessions, and there is no other case wherein the power of the Supreme Court to review depends on the amount or value in controversy.

I89. Quorum of Supreme Court justices absent

I11If a case brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a district court cannot be heard and determined because of the absence of a quorum of qualified justices, the Chief Justice of the United States may order it remitted to the court of appeals for the circuit including the district in which the case arose, to be heard and determined by that court either sitting in banc or specially constituted and composed of the three circuit judges senior in commission who are able to sit, as such order may direct. The decision of such court shall be final and conclusive. In the event of the disqualification or disability of one or more of such circuit judges, such court shall be filled as provided in chapter 15 of this title.

I11In any other case brought to the Supreme Court for review, which cannot be heard and determined because of the absence of a quorum of qualified justices, if a majority of the qualified justices shall be of opinion that the case cannot be heard and determined at the next ensuing term, the court shall enter its order affirming the judgment of the court from which the case was brought for review with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided court.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 963.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on portions of section 29 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 45 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation (Feb. 11, 1903, ch. 544, ÿ1A2, 32 Stat. 823; Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A291, 36 Stat. 1167; June 9, 1944, ch. 239, 58 Stat. 272).

I21Section consolidates portions of section 29 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 45 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes of substance and phraseology.

I21The revised section includes the principal provisions of sections 29 and 45 of titles 15 and 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respectively, in case of the absence of a quorum of qualified Justices of the Supreme Court.

I21Sections 29 and 45 of titles 15 and 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respectively, were identical and were applicable only to decisions of three-judge courts in antitrust cases under section 107 of said title 15 and Interstate Commerce cases under sections 1, 8, and 12 of said title 49, ``or any other acts having a like purpose that may hereinafter be enacted.'' The revised section broadens and extends the application of such provisions to include ``any case involving a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision of a district court or a district court of three judges which cannot be heard and determined because of the absence of a quorum of qualified justices.'' It includes direct appeals in criminal cases under section 3731 of title 18 (H.R. 1600, 80th Cong.).

I21Sections 29 and 45 of titles 15 and 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respectively provided that the Supreme Court certify the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals and that the Senior Circuit Judge, qualified to participate should designate himself and two other circuit judges next in order of seniority. Other provisions were made for designation of circuit judges from other circuits in case of insufficient circuit judges being available in the circuit.

I21The revised section permits the Chief Justice of the United States to designate the ``court of appeals'' to hear the case in banc or by means of a specially constituted court of appeals composed of the three circuit judges senior in commission who are able to sit. In case of disqualification or disability, the court shall be filled by designation and assignment as provided in chapter 15 of this title.

I21The provisions of section 29 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., and section 45 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to time for appeal are incorporated in section 2101 of this title. The provisions of said sections for direct appeal to the Supreme Court are retained in said titles 15 and 49.

I21The second paragraph of the revised section is new. It recognizes the necessity of final disposition of litigation in which appellate review has been had and further review by the Supreme Court is impossible for lack of a quorum of qualified justices.

I89. Record on review and enforcement of agency orders

I11(a) The rules prescribed under the authority of section 2072 of this title may provide for the time and manner of filing and the contents of the record in all proceedings instituted in the courts of appeals to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify, or otherwise review or enforce orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions, and officers. Such rules may authorize the agency, board, commission, or officer to file in the court a certified list of the materials comprising the record and retain and hold for the court all such materials and transmit the same or any part thereof to the court, when and as required by it, at any time prior to the final determination of the proceeding, and such filing of such certified list of the materials comprising the record and such subsequent transmittal of any such materials when and as required shall be deemed full compliance with any provision of law requiring the filing of the record in the court. The record in such proceedings shall be certified and filed in or held for and transmitted to the court of appeals by the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned within the time and in the manner prescribed by such rules. If proceedings are instituted in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same order, the following shall apply:

I12(1) If within ten days after issuance of the order the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned receives, from the persons instituting the proceedings, the petition for review with respect to proceedings in at least two courts of appeals, the agency, board, commission, or officer shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection. If within ten days after the issuance of the order the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned receives, from the persons instituting the proceedings, the petition for review with respect to proceedings in only one court of appeals, the agency, board, commission, or officer shall file the record in that court notwithstanding the institution in any other court of appeals of proceedings for review of that order. In all other cases in which proceedings have been instituted in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same order, the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned shall file the record in the court in which proceedings with respect to the order were first instituted.

I12(2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a copy of the petition or other pleading which institutes proceedings in a court of appeals and which is stamped by the court with the date of filing shall constitute the petition for review. Each agency, board, commission, or officer, as the case may be, shall designate by rule the office and the officer who must receive petitions for review under paragraph (1).

I12(3) If an agency, board, commission, or officer receives two or more petitions for review of an order in accordance with the first sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the agency, board, commission, or officer shall, promptly after the expiration of the ten-day period specified in that sentence, so notify the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation authorized by section 1407 of this title, in such form as that panel shall prescribe. The judicial panel on multidistrict litigation shall, by means of random selection, designate one court of appeals, from among the courts of appeals in which petitions for review have been filed and received within the ten-day period specified in the first sentence of paragraph (1), in which the record is to be filed, and shall issue an order consolidating the petitions for review in that court of appeals. The judicial panel on multidistrict litigation shall, after providing notice to the public and an opportunity for the submission of comments, prescribe rules with respect to the consolidation of proceedings under this paragraph. The agency, board, commission, or officer concerned shall file the record in the court of appeals designated pursuant to this paragraph.

I12(4) Any court of appeals in which proceedings with respect to an order of an agency, board, commission, or officer have been instituted may, to the extent authorized by law, stay the effective date of the order. Any such stay may thereafter be modified, revoked, or extended by a court of appeals designated pursuant to paragraph (3) with respect to that order or by any other court of appeals to which the proceedings are transferred.

I12(5) All courts in which proceedings are instituted with respect to the same order, other than the court in which the record is filed pursuant to this subsection, shall transfer those proceedings to the court in which the record is so filed. For the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice, the court in which the record is filed may thereafter transfer all the proceedings with respect to that order to any other court of appeals.

Q04

I11(b) The record to be filed in the court of appeals in such a proceeding shall consist of the order sought to be reviewed or enforced, the findings or report upon which it is based, and the pleadings, evidence, and proceedings before the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned, or such portions thereof (1) as the rules prescribed under the authority of section 2072 of this title may require to be included therein, or (2) as the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned, the petitioner for review or respondent in enforcement, as the case may be, and any intervenor in the court proceeding by written stipulation filed with the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned or in the court in any such proceeding may consistently with the rules prescribed under the authority of section 2072 of this title designate to be included therein, or (3) as the court upon motion of a party or, after a prehearing conference, upon its own motion may by order in any such proceeding designate to be included therein. Such a stipulation or order may provide in an appropriate case that no record need be filed in the court of appeals. If, however, the correctness of a finding of fact by the agency, board, commission, or officer is in question all of the evidence before the agency, board, commission, or officer shall be included in the record except such as the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned, the petitioner for review or respondent in enforcement, as the case may be, and any intervenor in the court proceeding by written stipulation filed with the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned or in the court agree to omit as wholly immaterial to the questioned finding. If there is omitted from the record any portion of the proceedings before the agency, board, commission, or officer which the court subsequently determines to be proper for it to consider to enable it to review or enforce the order in question the court may direct that such additional portion of the proceedings be filed as a supplement to the record. The agency, board, commission, or officer concerned may, at its option and without regard to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, and if so requested by the petitioner for review or respondent in enforcement shall, file in the court the entire record of the proceedings before it without abbreviation.

I11(c) The agency, board, commission, or officer concerned may transmit to the court of appeals the original papers comprising the whole or any part of the record or any supplemental record, otherwise true copies of such papers certified by an authorized officer or deputy of the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned shall be transmitted. Any original papers thus transmitted to the court of appeals shall be returned to the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned upon the final determination of the review or enforcement proceeding. Pending such final determination any such papers may be returned by the court temporarily to the custody of the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned if needed for the transaction of the public business. Certified copies of any papers included in the record or any supplemental record may also be returned to the agency, board, commission, or officer concerned upon the final determination of review or enforcement proceedings.

I11(d) The provisions of this section are not applicable to proceedings to review decisions of the Tax Court of the United States or to proceedings to review or enforce those orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions, or officers which are by law reviewable or enforceable by the district courts.

I21Section consolidates sections 451, 452 and 453 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with changes in phraseology necessary to effect the consolidation.

I21Words ``for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of restraint of liberty'' in section 452 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as merely descriptive of the writ.

I21Subsection (b) was added to give statutory sanction to orderly and appropriate procedure. A circuit judge who unnecessarily entertains applications which should be addressed to the district court, thereby disqualifies himself to hear such matters on appeal and to that extent limits his usefulness as a judge of the court of appeals. The Supreme Court and Supreme Court Justices should not be burdened with applications for writs cognizable in the district courts.

I12(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and

I12(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.

Q04

I11(3)(A) Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.

I11(d)(1) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of_

I12(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;

I12(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action;

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This section makes no material change in existing practice. Notwithstanding the opportunity open to litigants to abuse the writ, the courts have consistently refused to entertain successive ``nuisance'' applications for habeas corpus. It is derived from H.R. 4232 introduced in the first session of the Seventy-ninth Congress by Chairman Hatton Sumners of the Committee on the Judiciary and referred to that Committee.

I21The practice of suing out successive, repetitious, and unfounded writs of habeas corpus imposes an unnecessary burden on the courts. See T3Dorsey v. GillK, 1945, 148 F.2d 857, 862, in which Miller, J., notes that ``petitions for the writ are used not only as they should be to protect unfortunate persons against miscarriages of justice, but also as a device for harassing court, custodial, and enforcement officers with a multiplicity of repetitious, meritless requests for relief. The most extreme example is that of a person who, between July 1, 1939, and April 1944 presented in the District Court 50 petitions for writs of habeas corpus; another person has presented 27 petitions; a third, 24; a fourth, 22; a fifth, 20. One hundred nineteen persons have presented 597 petitions_an average of 5.''

I74Senate Revision Amendments

I21Section amended to modify original language which denied Federal judges power to entertain application for writ where legality of detention had been determined on prior application and later application presented no new grounds, and to omit reference to rehearing in section catch line and original provision authorizing hearing judge to grant rehearing. 80th Congress, Senate Report No. 1559, Amendment No. 45.

I21Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 104ÿ09132, ÿ1A106(b), amended subsec. (b) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (b) read as follows: ``When after an evidentiary hearing on the merits of a material factual issue, or after a hearing on the merits of an issue of law, a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court has been denied by a court of the United States or a justice or judge of the United States release from custody or other remedy on an application for a writ of habeas corpus, a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of such person need not be entertained by a court of the United States or a justice or judge of the United States unless the application alleges and is predicated on a factual or other ground not adjudicated on the hearing of the earlier application for the writ, and unless the court, justice, or judge is satisfied that the applicant has not on the earlier application deliberately withheld the newly asserted ground or otherwise abused the writ.''

I21``An appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court, unless the justice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause.''

I89. State custody; remedies in Federal courts

I11(a) The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.

I11(b)(1) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that_

I12(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State; or

I12(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or

I12(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.

Q04

I11(2) An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.

I11(3) A State shall not be deemed to have waived the exhaustion requirement or be estopped from reliance upon the requirement unless the State, through counsel, expressly waives the requirement.

I11(c) An applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, within the meaning of this section, if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.

I11(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim_

I12(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or

I12(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.

Q04

I11(e)(1) In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.

I11(2) If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that_

I12(A) the claim relies on_

I13(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or

I13(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and

Q04

I12(B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.

Q04

I11(f) If the applicant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in such State court proceeding to support the State court's determination of a factual issue made therein, the applicant, if able, shall produce that part of the record pertinent to a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support such determination. If the applicant, because of indigency or other reason is unable to produce such part of the record, then the State shall produce such part of the record and the Federal court shall direct the State to do so by order directed to an appropriate State official. If the State cannot provide such pertinent part of the record, then the court shall determine under the existing facts and circumstances what weight shall be given to the State court's factual determination.

I11(g) A copy of the official records of the State court, duly certified by the clerk of such court to be a true and correct copy of a finding, judicial opinion, or other reliable written indicia showing such a factual determination by the State court shall be admissible in the Federal court proceeding.

I11(h) Except as provided in section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act, in all proceedings brought under this section, and any subsequent proceedings on review, the court may appoint counsel for an applicant who is or becomes financially unable to afford counsel, except as provided by a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Appointment of counsel under this section shall be governed by section 3006A of title 18.

I11(i) The ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section 2254.

I74Senate Revision Amendments

I21Senate amendment to this section, Senate Report No. 1559, amendment No. 47, has three declared purposes, set forth as follows:

I21``The first is to eliminate from the prohibition of the section applications in behalf of prisoners in custody under authority of a State officer but whose custody has not been directed by the judgment of a State court. If the section were applied to applications by persons detained solely under authority of a State officer it would unduly hamper Federal courts in the protection of Federal officers prosecuted for acts committed in the course of official duty.

I21``The second purpose is to eliminate, as a ground of Federal jurisdiction to review by habeas corpus judgments of State courts, the proposition that the State court has denied a prisoner a `fair adjudication of the legality of his detention under the Constitution and laws of the United States.' The Judicial Conference believes that this would be an undesirable ground for Federal jurisdiction in addition to exhaustion of State remedies or lack of adequate remedy in the State courts because it would permit proceedings in the Federal court on this ground before the petitioner had exhausted his State remedies. This ground would, of course, always be open to a petitioner to assert in the Federal court after he had exhausted his State remedies or if he had no adequate State remedy.

I21``The third purpose is to substitute detailed and specific language for the phrase `no adequate remedy available.' That phrase is not sufficiently specific and precise, and its meaning should, therefore, be spelled out in more detail in the section as is done by the amendment.''

I81Rule 1. Scope

I11(a) T4Cases Involving a Petition underK 28 T4U.S.C.K ÿ1A2254. These rules govern a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in a United States district court under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254 by:

I12(1) a person in custody under a state-court judgment who seeks a determination that the custody violates the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States; and

I12(2) a person in custody under a state-court or federal-court judgment who seeks a determination that future custody under a state-court judgment would violate the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.

Q04

I11(b) T4Other CasesK. The district court may apply any or all of these rules to a habeas corpus petition not covered by Rule 1(a).

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Rule 1 provides that the habeas corpus rules are applicable to petitions by persons in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court. See T3Preiser v. RodriguezK, 411 U.S. 475, 484 (1973). Whether the rules ought to apply to other situations (T3e.gK., person in active military service, T3Glazier v. HackelK, 440 F.2d 592 (9th Cir. 1971); or a reservist called to active duty but not reported, T3Hammond v. LenfestK, 398 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1968)) is left to the discretion of the court.

I21The basic scope of habeas corpus is prescribed by statute. 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2241(c) provides that the ``writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless***(h)e is T3in custodyK in violation of the Constitution.'' 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254 deals specifically with state custody, providing that habeas corpus shall apply only ``in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court***.''

I21In T3Preiser v. Rodriguez, supraK, the court said: ``It is clear ... that the essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody, and that the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody.'' 411 U.S. at 484.

I21Initially the Supreme Court held that habeas corpus was appropriate only in those situations in which petitioner's claim would, if upheld, result in an immediate release from a present custody. T3McNally v. HillK, 293 U.S. 131 (1934). This was changed in T3Peyton v. RoweK, 391 U.S. 54 (1968), in which the court held that habeas corpus was a proper way to attack a consecutive sentence to be served in the future, expressing the view that consecutive sentences resulted in present custody under both judgments, not merely the one imposing the first sentence. This view was expanded in T3Carafas v. LaValleeK, 391 U.S. 234 (1968), to recognize the propriety of habeas corpus in a case in which petitioner was in custody when the petition had been originally filed but had since been unconditionally released from custody.

I21See also T3Preiser v. RodriguezK, 411 U.S. at 486 et seq.

I21Since T3CarafasK, custody has been construed more liberally by the courts so as to make a ÿ1A2255 motion or habeas corpus petition proper in more situations. ``In custody'' now includes a person who is: on parole, T3Jones v. CunninghamK, 371 U.S. 236 (1963); at large on his own recognizance but subject to several conditions pending execution of his sentence, T3Hensley v. Municipal CourtK, 411 U.S. 345 (1973); or released on bail after conviction pending final disposition of his case, T3Lefkowitz v. NewsomeK, 95 S.Ct. 886 (1975). See also T3United States v. ReK, 372 F.2d 641 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 912 (1967) (on probation); T3Walker v. North CarolinaK, 262 F.Supp. 102 (W.D.N.C. 1966), aff'd per curiam, 372 F.2d 129 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 917 (1967) (recipient of a conditionally suspended sentence); T3Burris v. RyanK, 397 F.2d 553 (7th Cir. 1968); T3Marden v. PurdyK, 409 F.2d 784 (5th Cir. 1969) (free on bail); T3United States ex rel. Smith v. DibellaK, 314 F.Supp. 446 (D.Conn. 1970) (release on own recognizance); T3Choung v. CaliforniaK, 320 F.Supp. 625 (E.D.Cal. 1970) (federal stay of state court sentence); T3United States ex rel. Meadows v. New YorkK, 426 F.2d 1176 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 941 (1971) (subject to parole detainer warrant); T3Capler v. City of GreenvilleK, 422 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 1970) (released on appeal bond); T3Glover v. North CarolinaK, 301 F.Supp. 364 (E.D.N.C. 1969) (sentence served, but as convicted felon disqualified from engaging in several activities).

I21The courts are not unanimous in dealing with the above situations, and the boundaries of custody remain somewhat unclear. In T3Morgan v. ThomasK, 321 F.Supp. 565 (S.D.Miss. 1970), the court noted:

I22It is axiomatic that actual physical custody or restraint is not required to confer habeas jurisdiction. Rather, the term is synonymous with restraint of liberty. The real question is how much restraint of one's liberty is necessary before the right to apply for the writ comes into play. ***

I22It is clear however, that something more than moral restraint is necessary to make a case for habeas corpus.

I71321 F.Supp. at 573

I21T3Hammond v. LenfestK, 398 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1968), reviewed prior ``custody'' doctrine and reaffirmed a generalized flexible approach to the issue. In speaking about 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2241, the first section in the habeas corpus statutes, the court said:

I22While the language of the Act indicates that a writ of habeas corpus is appropriate only when a petitioner is ``in custody,'' *** the Act ``does not attempt to mark the boundaries of `custody' nor in any way other than by use of that word attempt to limit the situations in which the writ can be used.'' *** And, recent Supreme Court decisions have made clear that ``[i]t [habeas corpus] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose_the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.'' *** ``[B]esides physical imprisonment, there are other restraints on a man's liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally, which have been thought sufficient in the English-speaking world to support the issuance of habeas corpus.''

I71398 F.2d at 710ÿ09711

I21There is, as of now, no final list of the situations which are appropriate for habeas corpus relief. It is not the intent of these rules or notes to define or limit ``custody.''

I21It is, however, the view of the Advisory Committee that claims of improper conditions of custody or confinement (not related to the propriety of the custody itself), can better be handled by other means such as 42 U.S.C. ÿ1A1983 and other related statutes. In T3Wilwording v. SwansonK, 404 U.S. 249 (1971), the court treated a habeas corpus petition by a state prisoner challenging the conditions of confinement as a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. ÿ1A1983, the Civil Rights Act. Compare T3Johnson v. AveryK, 393 U.S. 483 (1969).

I21The distinction between duration of confinement and conditions of confinement may be difficult to draw. Compare T3Preiser v. RodriguezK, 411 U.S. 475 (1973), with T3Clutchette v. ProcunierK, 497 F.2d 809 (9th Cir. 1974), modified, 510 F.2d 613 (1975).

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 1 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. In response to at least one commentator on the published rules, the Committee modified Rule 1(b) to reflect the point that if the court was considering a habeas petition not covered by ÿ1A2254, the court could apply some or all of the rules.

I81Rule 2. The Petition

I11(a) T4Current Custody; Naming the RespondentK. If the petitioner is currently in custody under a state-court judgment, the petition must name as respondent the state officer who has custody.

I11(b) T4Future Custody; Naming the Respondents and Specifying the JudgmentK. If the petitioner is not yet in custody_but may be subject to future custody_under the state-court judgment being contested, the petition must name as respondents both the officer who has current custody and the attorney general of the state where the judgment was entered. The petition must ask for relief from the state-court judgment being contested.

I11(c) T4FormK. The petition must:

I12(1) specify all the grounds for relief available to the petitioner;

I12(2) state the facts supporting each ground;

I12(3) state the relief requested;

I12(4) be printed, typewritten, or legibly handwritten; and

I12(5) be signed under penalty of perjury by the petitioner or by a person authorized to sign it for the petitioner under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2242.

Q04

I11(d) T4Standard FormK. The petition must substantially follow either the form appended to these rules or a form prescribed by a local district-court rule. The clerk must make forms available to petitioners without charge.

I11(e) T4Separate Petitions for Judgments of Separate CourtsK. A petitioner who seeks relief from judgments of more than one state court must file a separate petition covering the judgment or judgments of each court.

I53(As amended Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(1), (2), Sept. 28, 1976, 90 Stat. 1334; Apr. 28, 1982, eff. Aug. 1, 1982; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Rule 2 describes the requirements of the actual petition, including matters relating to its form, contents, scope, and sufficiency. The rule provides more specific guidance for a petitioner and the court than 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2242, after which it is patterned.

I21Subdivision (a) provides that an applicant challenging a state judgment, pursuant to which he is presently in custody, must make his application in the form of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. It also requires that the state officer having custody of the applicant be named as respondent. This is consistent with 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2242, which says in part, ``[Application for a writ of habeas corpus] shall allege *** the name of the person who has custody over [the applicant] ***.'' The proper person to be served in the usual case is either the warden of the institution in which the petitioner is incarcerated (T3Sanders v. BennettK, 148 F.2d 19 (D.C.Cir. 1945)) or the chief officer in charge of state penal institutions.

I21Subdivision (b) prescribes the procedure to be used for a petition challenging a judgment under which the petitioner will be subject to custody in the future. In this event the relief sought will usually not be released from present custody, but rather for a declaration that the judgment being attacked is invalid. Subdivision (b) thus provides for a prayer for ``appropriate relief.'' It is also provided that the attorney general of the state of the judgment as well as the state officer having actual custody of the petitioner shall be named as respondents. This is appropriate because no one will have custody of the petitioner in the state of the judgment being attacked, and the habeas corpus action will usually be defended by the attorney general. The attorney general is in the best position to inform the court as to who the proper party respondent is. If it is not the attorney general, he can move for a substitution of party.

I21Since the concept of ``custody'' requisite to the consideration of a petition for habeas corpus has been enlarged significantly in recent years, it may be worthwhile to spell out the various situations which might arise and who should be named as respondent(s) for each situation.

I21(1) The applicant is in jail, prison, or other actual physical restraint due to the state action he is attacking. The named respondent shall be the state officer who has official custody of the petitioner (for example, the warden of the prison).

I21(2) The applicant is on probation or parole due to the state judgment he is attacking. The named respondents shall be the particular probation or parole officer responsible for supervising the applicant, and the official in charge of the parole or probation agency, or the state correctional agency, as appropriate.

I21(3) The applicant is in custody in any other manner differing from (1) and (2) above due to the effects of the state action he seeks relief from. The named respondent should be the attorney general of the state wherein such action was taken.

I21(4) The applicant is in jail, prison, or other actual physical restraint but is attacking a state action which will cause him to be kept in custody in the future rather than the government action under which he is presently confined. The named respondents shall be the state or federal officer who has official custody of him at the time the petition is filed and the attorney general of the state whose action subjects the petitioner to future custody.

I21(5) The applicant is in custody, although not physically restrained, and is attacking a state action which will result in his future custody rather than the government action out of which his present custody arises. The named respondent(s) shall be the attorney general of the state whose action subjects the petitioner to future custody, as well as the government officer who has present official custody of the petitioner if there is such an officer and his identity is ascertainable.

I21In any of the above situations the judge may require or allow the petitioner to join an additional or different party as a respondent if to do so would serve the ends of justice.

I21As seen in rule 1 and paragraphs (4) and (5) above, these rules contemplate that a petitioner currently in federal custody will be permitted to apply for habeas relief from a state restraint which is to go into effect in the future. There has been disagreement in the courts as to whether they have jurisdiction of the habeas application under these circumstances (compare T3Piper v. United StatesK, 306 F.Supp. 1259 (D.Conn. 1969), with T3United States ex rel. Meadows v. New YorkK, 426 F.2d 1176 (2d Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 941 (1971)). This rule seeks to make clear that they do have such jurisdiction.

I21Subdivision (c) provides that unless a district court requires otherwise by local rule, the petition must be in the form annexed to these rules. Having a standard prescribed form has several advantages. In the past, petitions have frequently contained mere conclusions of law, unsupported by any facts. Since it is the relationship of the facts to the claim asserted that is important, these petitions were obviously deficient. In addition, lengthy and often illegible petitions, arranged in no logical order, were submitted to judges who have had to spend hours deciphering them. For example, in T3Passic v. MichiganK, 98 F.Supp. 1015, 1016 (E.D.Mich. 1951), the court dismissed a petition for habeas corpus, describing it as ``two thousand pages of irrational, prolix and redundant pleadings ***.''

I21Administrative convenience, of benefit to both the court and the petitioner, results from the use of a prescribed form. Judge Hubert L. Will briefly described the experience with the use of a standard form in the Northern District of Illinois:

I22Our own experience, though somewhat limited, has been quite satisfactory. ***

I22In addition, [petitions] almost always contain the necessary basic information ***. Very rarely do we get the kind of hybrid federal-state habeas corpus petition with civil rights allegations thrown in which were not uncommon in the past. *** [W]hen a real constitutional issue is raised it is quickly apparent ***.

I7133 F.R.D. 363, 384

I21Approximately 65 to 70% of all districts have adopted forms or local rules which require answers to essentially the same questions as contained in the standard form annexed to these rules. All courts using forms have indicated the petitions are time-saving and more legible. The form is particularly helpful in getting information about whether there has been an exhaustion of state remedies or, at least, where that information can be obtained.

I21The requirement of a standard form benefits the petitioner as well. His assertions are more readily apparent, and a meritorious claim is more likely to be properly raised and supported. The inclusion in the form of the ten most frequently raised grounds in habeas corpus petitions is intended to encourage the applicant to raise all his asserted grounds in one petition. It may better enable him to recognize if an issue he seeks to raise is cognizable under habeas corpus and hopefully inform him of those issues as to which he must first exhaust his state remedies.

I21Some commentators have suggested that the use of forms is of little help because the questions usually are too general, amounting to little more than a restatement of the statute. They contend the blanks permit a prisoner to fill in the same ambiguous answers he would have offered without the aid of a form. See Comment, Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1177ÿ091178 (1970). Certainly, as long as the statute requires factual pleading, the adequacy of a petition will continue to be affected largely by the petitioner's intelligence and the legal advice available to him. On balance, however, the use of forms has contributed enough to warrant mandating their use.

I21Giving the petitioner a list of often-raised grounds may, it is said, encourage perjury. See Comment, Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1178 (1970). Most inmates are aware of, or have access to, some common constitutional grounds for relief. Thus, the risk of perjury is not likely to be substantially increased and the benefit of the list for some inmates seems sufficient to outweigh any slight risk that perjury will increase. There is a penalty for perjury, and this would seem the most appropriate way to try to discourage it.

I21Legal assistance is increasingly available to inmates either through paraprofessional programs involving law students or special programs staffed by members of the bar. See Jacob and Sharma, Justice After Trial: Prisoners' Need for Legal Services in the Criminal-Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev. 493 (1970). In these situations, the prescribed form can be filled out more competently, and it does serve to ensure a degree of uniformity in the manner in which habeas corpus claims are presented.

I21Subdivision (c) directs the clerk of the district court to make available to applicants upon request, without charge, blank petitions in the prescribed form.

I21Subdivision (c) also requires that all available grounds for relief be presented in the petition, including those grounds of which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, the petitioner should be aware. This is reinforced by rule 9(b), which allows dismissal of a second petition which fails to allege new grounds or, if new grounds are alleged, the judge finds an inexcusable failure to assert the ground in the prior petition.

I21Both subdivision (c) and the annexed form require a legibly handwritten or typewritten petition. As required by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2242, the petition must be signed and sworn to by the petitioner (or someone acting in his behalf).

I21Subdivision (d) provides that a single petition may assert a claim only against the judgment or judgments of a single state court (T3i.eK., a court of the same county or judicial district or circuit). This permits, but does not require, an attack in a single petition on judgments based upon separate indictments or on separate counts even though sentences were imposed on separate days by the same court. A claim against a judgment of a court of a different political subdivision must be raised by means of a separate petition.

I21Subdivision (e) allows the clerk to return an insufficient petition to the petitioner, and it must be returned if the clerk is so directed by a judge of the court. Any failure to comply with the requirements of rule 2 or 3 is grounds for insufficiency. In situations where there may be arguable noncompliance with another rule, such as rule 9, the judge, not the clerk, must make the decision. If the petition is returned it must be accompanied by a statement of the reason for its return. No petitioner should be left to speculate as to why or in what manner his petition failed to conform to these rules.

I21Subdivision (e) also provides that the clerk shall retain one copy of the insufficient petition. If the prisoner files another petition, the clerk will be in a better position to determine the sufficiency of the new petition. If the new petition is insufficient, comparison with the prior petition may indicate whether the prisoner has failed to understand the clerk's prior explanation for its insufficiency, so that the clerk can make another, hopefully successful, attempt at transmitting this information to the petitioner. If the petitioner insists that the original petition was in compliance with the rules, a copy of the original petition is available for the consideration of the judge. It is probably better practice to make a photocopy of a petition which can be corrected by the petitioner, thus saving the petitioner the task of completing an additional copy.

I711982 T4Amendment

I21Subdivision (c). The amendment takes into account 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1746, enacted after adoption of the ÿ1A2254 rules. Section 1746 provides that in lieu of an affidavit an unsworn statement may be given under penalty of perjury in substantially the following form if executed within the United States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: ``I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).'' The statute is ``intended to encompass prisoner litigation,'' and the statutory alternative is especially appropriate in such cases because a notary might not be readily available. T3Carter v. ClarkK, 616 F.2d 228 (5th Cir. 1980). The ÿ1A2254 forms have been revised accordingly.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.

I21Revised Rule 2(c)(5) has been amended by removing the requirement that the petition be signed personally by the petitioner. As reflected in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2242, an application for habeas corpus relief may be filed by the person who is seeking relief, or by someone acting on behalf of that person. T3See, e.g., Whitmore v. ArkansasK, 495 U.S. 149 (1990) (discussion of requisites for ``next friend'' standing in petition for habeas corpus). Thus, under the, [sic] amended rule the petition may be signed by petitioner personally or by someone acting on behalf of the petitioner, assuming that the person is authorized to do so, for example, an attorney for the petitioner. The Committee envisions that the courts will apply third-party, or ``next-friend,'' standing analysis in deciding whether the signer was actually authorized to sign the petition on behalf of the petitioner.

I21The language in new Rule 2(d) has been changed to reflect that a petitioner must substantially follow the standard form, which is appended to the rules, or a form provided by the court. The current rule, Rule 2(c), seems to indicate a preference for the standard ``national'' form. Under the amended rule, there is no stated preference. The Committee understood that current practice in some courts is that if the petitioner first files a petition using the national form, the courts may then ask the petitioner to supplement it with the local form.

I21Current Rule 2(e), which provided for returning an insufficient petition, has been deleted. The Committee believed that the approach in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e) was more appropriate for dealing with petitions that do not conform to the form requirements of the rule. That Rule provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the petitioner suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the petition was deemed insufficient. Now that a one-year statute of limitations applies to petitions filed under ÿ1A2254, T3seeK 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d)(1), the court's dismissal of a petition because it is not in proper form may pose a significant penalty for a petitioner, who may not be able to file another petition within the one-year limitations period. Now, under revised Rule 3(b), the clerk is required to file a petition, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with the provisions in revised Rule 2(c). The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective petition and require the petitioner to submit a corrected petition that conforms to Rule 2(c).

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee changed Rule 2(c)(2) to read ``state the facts'' rather then [sic] ``briefly summarize the facts.'' As one commentator noted, the current language may actually mislead the petitioner and is also redundant. The Committee modified Rule 2(c)(5) to emphasize that any person, other than the petitioner, who signs the petition must be authorized to do so; the revised rule now specifically cites ÿ1A2242. The Note was changed to reflect that point.

I21Rule 2(c)(4) was modified to account for those cases where the petitioner prints the petition on a computer word-processing program.

I74Amendments by Public Law

I211976_Subd. (c). Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(1), inserted ``substantially'' after ``The petition shall be in'', and struck out requirement that the petition follow the prescribed form.

I21Subd. (e). Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(2), inserted ``substantially'' after ``district court does not'', and struck out provision which permitted the clerk to return a petition for noncompliance without a judge so directing.

I81Rule 3. Filing the Petition; Inmate Filing

I11(a) T4Where to File; Copies; Filing FeeK. An original and two copies of the petition must be filed with the clerk and must be accompanied by:

I12(1) the applicable filing fee, or

I12(2) a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, the affidavit required by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1915, and a certificate from the warden or other appropriate officer of the place of confinement showing the amount of money or securities that the petitioner has in any account in the institution.

Q04

I11(b) T4FilingK. The clerk must file the petition and enter it on the docket.

I11(c) T4Time to FileK. The time for filing a petition is governed by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d).

I11(d) T4Inmate FilingK. A paper filed by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if deposited in the institution's internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Rule 3 sets out the procedures to be followed by the petitioner and the court in filing the petition. Some of its provisions are currently dealt with by local rule or practice, while others are innovations. Subdivision (a) specifies the petitioner's responsibilities. It requires that the petition, which must be accompanied by two conformed copies thereof, be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court. The petition must be accompanied by the filing fee prescribed by law (presently $5; see 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1914(a)), unless leave to prosecute the petition in forma pauperis is applied for and granted. In the event the petitioner desires to prosecute the petition in forma pauperis, he must file the affidavit required by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1915, together with a certificate showing the amount of funds in his institutional account.

I21Requiring that the petition be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court provides an efficient and uniform system of filing habeas corpus petitions.

I21Subdivision (b) requires the clerk to file the petition. If the filing fee accompanies the petition, it may be filed immediately, and, if not, it is contemplated that prompt attention will be given to the request to proceed in forma pauperis. The court may delegate the issuance of the order to the clerk in those cases in which it is clear from the petition that there is full compliance with the requirements to proceed in forma pauperis.

I21Requiring the copies of the petition to be filed with the clerk will have an impact not only upon administrative matters, but upon more basic problems as well. In districts with more than one judge, a petitioner under present circumstances may send a petition to more than one judge. If no central filing system exists for each district, two judges may independently take different action on the same petition. Even if the action taken is consistent, there may be needless duplication of effort.

I21The requirement of an additional two copies of the form of the petition is a current practice in many courts. An efficient filing system requires one copy for use by the court (central file), one for the respondent (under 3(b), the respondent receives a copy of the petition whether an answer is required or not), and one for petitioner's counsel, if appointed. Since rule 2 provides that blank copies of the petition in the prescribed form are to be furnished to the applicant free of charge, there should be no undue burden created by this requirement.

I21Attached to copies of the petition supplied in accordance with rule 2 is an affidavit form for the use of petitioners desiring to proceed in forma pauperis. The form requires information concerning the petitioner's financial resources.

I21In forma pauperis cases, the petition must also be accompanied by a certificate indicating the amount of funds in the petitioner's institution account. Usually the certificate will be from the warden. If the petitioner is on probation or parole, the court might want to require a certificate from the supervising officer. Petitions by persons on probation or parole are not numerous enough, however, to justify making special provision for this situation in the text of the rule.

I21The certificate will verify the amount of funds credited to the petitioner in an institution account. The district court may by local rule require that any amount credited to the petitioner, in excess of a stated maximum, must be used for the payment of the filing fee. Since prosecuting an action in forma pauperis is a privilege (see T3Smart v. HeinzeK, 347 F.2d 114, 116 (9th Cir. 1965)), it is not to be granted when the petitioner has sufficient resources.

I21Subdivision (b) details the clerk's duties with regard to filing the petition. If the petition does not appear on its face to comply with the requirements of rules 2 and 3, it may be returned in accordance with rule 2(e). If it appears to comply, it must be filed and entered on the docket in the clerk's office. However, under this subdivision the respondent is not required to answer or otherwise move with respect to the petition unless so ordered by the court.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 3 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended except as described below.

I21The last sentence of current Rule 3(b), dealing with an answer being filed by the respondent, has been moved to revised Rule 5(a).

I21Revised Rule 3(b) is new and is intended to parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e), which provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the petitioner suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the petition was deemed insufficient. That Act, however, added a one-year statute of limitations to petitions filed under ÿ1A2254, T3seeK 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d)(1). Thus, a court's dismissal of a defective petition may pose a significant penalty for a petitioner who may not be able to file a corrected petition within the one-year limitations period. The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective petition and require the petitioner to submit a corrected petition that conforms to Rule 2. Thus, revised Rule 3(b) requires the clerk to file a petition, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with Rule 2. The rule, however, is not limited to those instances where the petition is defective only in form; the clerk would also be required, for example, to file the petition even though it lacked the requisite filing fee or an T3in forma pauperisK form.

I21Revised Rule 3(c), which sets out a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d), is new and has been added to put petitioners on notice that a one-year statute of limitations applies to petitions filed under these Rules. Although the rule does not address the issue, every circuit that has addressed the issue has taken the position that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is available in appropriate circumstances. T3See, e.g., Smith v. McGinnisK, 208 F.3d 13, 17ÿ0918 (2d Cir. 2000); T3Miller v. New Jersey State Department of CorrectionsK, 145 F.3d 616, 618ÿ0919 (3d Cir. 1998); T3Harris v. HutchinsonK, 209 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2000). The Supreme Court has not addressed the question directly. T3See Duncan v. WalkerK, 533 U.S. 167, 181 (2001) (``We ... have no occasion to address the question that Justice Stevens raises concerning the availability of equitable tolling.'').

I21Rule 3(d) is new and provides guidance on determining whether a petition from an inmate is considered to have been filed in a timely fashion. The new provision parallels Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(C).

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee Note was changed to reflect that the clerk must file a petition, even in those instances where the necessary filing fee or in forma pauperis form is not attached. The Note also includes new language concerning the equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.

I81Rule 4. Preliminary Review; Serving the Petition and Order

I11The clerk must promptly forward the petition to a judge under the court's assignment procedure, and the judge must promptly examine it. If it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court, the judge must dismiss the petition and direct the clerk to notify the petitioner. If the petition is not dismissed, the judge must order the respondent to file an answer, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take other action the judge may order. In every case, the clerk must serve a copy of the petition and any order on the respondent and on the attorney general or other appropriate officer of the state involved.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Rule 4 outlines the options available to the court after the petition is properly filed. The petition must be promptly presented to and examined by the judge to whom it is assigned. If it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits attached thereto that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court, the judge must enter an order summarily dismissing the petition and cause the petitioner to be notified. If summary dismissal is not ordered, the judge must order the respondent to file an answer or to otherwise plead to the petition within a time period to be fixed in the order.

I2128 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243 requires that the writ shall be awarded, or an order to show cause issued, ``unless it appears from the application that the applicant or person detained is not entitled thereto.'' Such consideration may properly encompass any exhibits attached to the petition, including, but not limited to, transcripts, sentencing records, and copies of state court opinions. The judge may order any of these items for his consideration if they are not yet included with the petition. See 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A753(f) which authorizes payment for transcripts in habeas corpus cases.

I21It has been suggested that an answer should be required in every habeas proceeding, taking into account the usual petitioner's lack of legal expertise and the important functions served by the return. See Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1178 (1970). However, under ÿ1A2243 it is the duty of the court to screen out frivolous applications and eliminate the burden that would be placed on the respondent by ordering an unnecessary answer. T3Allen v. PeriniK, 424 F.2d 134, 141 (6th Cir. 1970). In addition, ``notice'' pleading is not sufficient, for the petition is expected to state facts that point to a ``real possibility of constitutional error.'' See T3Aubut v. State of MaineK, 431 F.2d 688, 689 (1st Cir. 1970).

I21In the event an answer is ordered under rule 4, the court is accorded greater flexibility than under ÿ1A2243 in determining within what time period an answer must be made. Under ÿ1A2243, the respondent must make a return within three days after being so ordered, with additional time of up to forty days allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 81(a)(2), for good cause. In view of the widespread state of work overload in prosecutors' offices (see, T3e.g., AllenK, 424 F.2d at 141), additional time is granted in some jurisdictions as a matter of course. Rule 4, which contains no fixed time requirement, gives the court the discretion to take into account various factors such as the respondent's workload and the availability of transcripts before determining a time within which an answer must be made.

I21Rule 4 authorizes the judge to ``take such other action as the judge deems appropriate.'' This is designed to afford the judge flexibility in a case where either dismissal or an order to answer may be inappropriate. For example, the judge may want to authorize the respondent to make a motion to dismiss based upon information furnished by respondent, which may show that petitioner's claims have already been decided on the merits in a federal court; that petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies; that the petitioner is not in custody within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254; or that a decision in the matter is pending in state court. In these situations, a dismissal may be called for on procedural grounds, which may avoid burdening the respondent with the necessity of filing an answer on the substantive merits of the petition. In other situations, the judge may want to consider a motion from respondent to make the petition more certain. Or the judge may want to dismiss some allegations in the petition, requiring the respondent to answer only those claims which appear to have some arguable merit.

I21Rule 4 requires that a copy of the petition and any order be served by certified mail on the respondent and the attorney general of the state involved. See 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2252. Presently, the respondent often does not receive a copy of the petition unless the court directs an answer under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243. Although the attorney general is served, he is not required to answer if it is more appropriate for some other agency to do so. Although the rule does not specifically so provide, it is assumed that copies of the court orders to respondent will be mailed to petitioner by the court.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 4 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.

I21The amended rule reflects that the response to a habeas petition may be a motion.

I21The requirement that in every case the clerk must serve a copy of the petition on the respondent by certified mail has been deleted. In addition, the current requirement that the petition be sent to the Attorney General of the state has been modified to reflect practice in some jurisdictions that the appropriate state official may be someone other than the Attorney General, for example, the officer in charge of a local confinement facility. This comports with a similar provision in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2252, which addresses notice of habeas corpus proceedings to the state's attorney general or other appropriate officer of the state.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Rule was modified slightly to reflect the view of some commentators that it is common practice in some districts for the government to file a pre-answer motion to dismiss. The Committee agreed with that recommendation and changed the word ``pleading'' in the rule to ``response.'' It also made several minor changes to the Committee Note.

I81Rule 5. The Answer and the Reply

I11(a) T4When RequiredK. The respondent is not required to answer the petition unless a judge so orders.

I11(b) T4Contents: Addressing the Allegations; Stating a BarK. The answer must address the allegations in the petition. In addition, it must state whether any claim in the petition is barred by a failure to exhaust state remedies, a procedural bar, non-retroactivity, or a statute of limitations.

I11(c) T4Contents: TranscriptsK. The answer must also indicate what transcripts (of pretrial, trial, sentencing, or post-conviction proceedings) are available, when they can be furnished, and what proceedings have been recorded but not transcribed. The respondent must attach to the answer parts of the transcript that the respondent considers relevant. The judge may order that the respondent furnish other parts of existing transcripts or that parts of untranscribed recordings be transcribed and furnished. If a transcript cannot be obtained, the respondent may submit a narrative summary of the evidence.

I11(d) T4Contents: Briefs on Appeal and OpinionsK. The respondent must also file with the answer a copy of:

I12(1) any brief that the petitioner submitted in an appellate court contesting the conviction or sentence, or contesting an adverse judgment or order in a post-conviction proceeding;

I12(2) any brief that the prosecution submitted in an appellate court relating to the conviction or sentence; and

I12(3) the opinions and dispositive orders of the appellate court relating to the conviction or the sentence.

Q04

I11(e) T4ReplyK. The petitioner may submit a reply to the respondent's answer or other pleading within a time fixed by the judge.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Rule 5 details the contents of the ``answer''. (This is a change in terminology from ``return,'' which is still used below when referring to prior practice.) The answer plays an obviously important rule in a habeas proceeding:

I31The return serves several important functions: it permits the court and the parties to uncover quickly the disputed issues; it may reveal to the petitioner's attorney grounds for release that the petitioner did not know; and it may demonstrate that the petitioner's claim is wholly without merit.

I34Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1083, 1178 (1970).

I21The answer must respond to the allegations of the petition. While some districts require this by local rule (see, T3e.gK., E.D.N.C.R. 17(B)), under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243 little specificity is demanded. As a result, courts occasionally receive answers which contain only a statement certifying the true cause of detention, or a series of delaying motions such as motions to dismiss. The requirement of the proposed rule that the ``answer shall respond to the allegations of the petition'' is intended to ensure that a responsive pleading will be filed and thus the functions of the answer fully served.

I21The answer must also state whether the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies. This is a prerequisite to eligibility for the writ under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254(b) and applies to every ground the petitioner raises. Most form petitions now in use contain questions requiring information relevant to whether the petitioner has exhausted his remedies. However, the exhaustion requirement is often not understood by the unrepresented petitioner. The attorney general has both the legal expertise and access to the record and thus is in a much better position to inform the court on the matter of exhaustion of state remedies. An alleged failure to exhaust state remedies as to any ground in the petition may be raised by a motion by the attorney general, thus avoiding the necessity of a formal answer as to that ground.

I21The rule requires the answer to indicate what transcripts are available, when they can be furnished, and also what proceedings have been recorded and not transcribed. This will serve to inform the court and petitioner as to what factual allegations can be checked against the actual transcripts. The transcripts include pretrial transcripts relating, for example, to pretrial motions to suppress; transcripts of the trial or guilty plea proceeding; and transcripts of any post-conviction proceedings which may have taken place. The respondent is required to furnish those portions of the transcripts which he believes relevant. The court may order the furnishing of additional portions of the transcripts upon the request of petitioner or upon the court's own motion.

I21Where transcripts are unavailable, the rule provides that a narrative summary of the evidence may be submitted.

I21Rule 5 (and the general procedure set up by this entire set of rules) does not contemplate a traverse to the answer, except under special circumstances. See advisory committee note to rule 9. Therefore, the old common law assumption of verity of the allegations of a return until impeached, as codified in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2248, is no longer applicable. The meaning of the section, with its exception to the assumption ``to the extent that the judge finds from the evidence that they (the allegations) are not true,'' has given attorneys and courts a great deal of difficulty. It seems that when the petition and return pose an issue of fact, no traverse is required; T3Stewart v. OverholserK, 186 F.2d 339 (D.C. Cir. 1950).

I22We read ÿ1A2248 of the Judicial Code as not requiring a traverse when a factual issue has been clearly framed by the petition and the return or answer. This section provides that the allegations of a return or answer to an order to show cause shall be accepted as true if not traversed, except to the extent the judge finds from the evidence that they are not true. This contemplates that where the petition and return or answer do present an issue of fact material to the legality of detention, evidence is required to resolve that issue despite the absence of a traverse. This reference to evidence assumes a hearing on issues raised by the allegations of the petition and the return or answer to the order to show cause.

I71186 F.2d at 342, n. 5

I21In actual practice, the traverse tends to be a mere pro forma refutation of the return, serving little if any expository function. In the interests of a more streamlined and manageable habeas corpus procedure, it is not required except in those instances where it will serve a truly useful purpose. Also, under rule 11 the court is given the discretion to incorporate Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when appropriate, so civil rule 15(a) may be used to allow the petitioner to amend his petition when the court feels this is called for by the contents of the answer.

I21Rule 5 does not indicate who the answer is to be served upon, but it necessarily implies that it will be mailed to the petitioner (or to his attorney if he has one). The number of copies of the answer required is left to the court's discretion. Although the rule requires only a copy of petitioner's brief on appeal, respondent is free also to file a copy of respondent's brief. In practice, courts have found it helpful to have a copy of respondent's brief.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.

I21Revised Rule 5(a), which provides that the respondent is not required to file an answer to the petition, unless a judge so orders, is taken from current Rule 3(b). The revised rule does not address the practice in some districts, where the respondent files a pre-answer motion to dismiss the petition. But revised Rule 4 permits that practice and reflects the view that if the court does not dismiss the petition, it may require (or permit) the respondent to file a motion.

I21Rule 5(b) has been amended to require that the answer address not only failure to exhaust state remedies, but also procedural bars, non-retroactivity, and any statute of limitations. Although the latter three matters are not addressed in the current rule, the Committee intends no substantive change with the additional new language. T3See, e.g.K, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254(b)(3). Instead, the Committee believes that the explicit mention of those issues in the rule conforms to current case law and statutory provisions. T3See, e.g.K, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d)(1).

I21Revised Rule 5(d) includes new material. First, Rule 5(d)(2), requires a respondent_assuming an answer is filed_to provide the court with a copy of any brief submitted by the prosecution to the appellate court. And Rule 5(d)(3) now provides that the respondent also file copies of any opinions and dispositive orders of the appellate court concerning the conviction or sentence. These provisions are intended to ensure that the court is provided with additional information that may assist it in resolving the issues raised, or not raised, in the petition.

I21Finally, revised Rule 5(e) adopts the practice in some jurisdictions of giving the petitioner an opportunity to file a reply to the respondent's answer. Rather than using terms such as ``traverse,'' T3seeK 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2248, to identify the petitioner's response to the answer, the rule uses the more general term ``reply.'' The Rule prescribes that the court set the time for such responses and in lieu of setting specific time limits in each case, the court may decide to include such time limits in its local rules.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. Rule 5(a) was modified to read that the government is not required to ``respond'' to the petition unless the court so orders; the term ``respond'' was used because it leaves open the possibility that the government's first response (as it is in some districts) is in the form of a pre-answer motion to dismiss the petition. The Note has been changed to reflect the fact that although the rule itself does not reflect that particular motion, it is used in some districts and refers the reader to Rule 4.

I21The Committee also deleted the reference to ``affirmative defenses,'' because the Committee believed that the term was a misnomer in the context of habeas petitions. The Note was also changed to reflect that there has been a potential substantive change from the current rule, to the extent that the published rule now requires that the answer address procedural bars and any statute of limitations. The Note states that the Committee believes the new language reflects current law.

I21The Note was modified to address the use of the term ``traverse.'' One commentator noted that that is the term that is commonly used but that it does not appear in the rule itself.

I81Rule 6. Discovery

I11(a) T4Leave of Court RequiredK. A judge may, for good cause, authorize a party to conduct discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and may limit the extent of discovery. If necessary for effective discovery, the judge must appoint an attorney for a petitioner who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A.

I11(b) T4Requesting DiscoveryK. A party requesting discovery must provide reasons for the request. The request must also include any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents.

I11(c) T4Deposition ExpensesK. If the respondent is granted leave to take a deposition, the judge may require the respondent to pay the travel expenses, subsistence expenses, and fees of the petitioner's attorney to attend the deposition.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21This rule prescribes the procedures governing discovery in habeas corpus cases. Subdivision (a) provides that any party may utilize the processes of discovery available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (rules 26ÿ0937) if, and to the extent that, the judge allows. It also provides for the appointment of counsel for a petitioner who qualifies for this when counsel is necessary for effective utilization of discovery procedures permitted by the judge.

I21Subdivision (a) is consistent with T3Harris v. NelsonK, 394 U.S. 286 (1969). In that case the court noted,

I31[I]t is clear that there was no intention to extend to habeas corpus, as a matter of right, the broad discovery provisions *** of the new [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure].

I71394 U.S. at 295

I33However, citing the lack of methods for securing information in habeas proceedings, the court pointed to an alternative.

I31Clearly, in these circumstances *** the courts may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage. *** Their authority is expressly confirmed in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1651.

I71394 U.S. at 299

I21The court concluded that the issue of discovery in habeas corpus cases could best be dealt with as part of an effort to provide general rules of practice for habeas corpus cases:

I22In fact, it is our view that the rulemaking machinery should be invoked to formulate rules of practice with respect to federal habeas corpus and ÿ1A2255 proceedings, on a comprehensive basis and not merely one confined to discovery. The problems presented by these proceedings are materially different from those dealt with in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and reliance upon usage and the opaque language of Civil Rule 81(a)(2) is transparently inadequate. In our view the results of a meticulous formulation and adoption of special rules for federal habeas corpus and ÿ1A2255 proceedings would promise much benefit.

I71394 U.S. at 301 n. 7

I21Discovery may, in appropriate cases, aid in developing facts necessary to decide whether to order an evidentiary hearing or to grant the writ following an evidentiary hearing:

I31We are aware that confinement sometimes induces fantasy which has its basis in the paranoia of prison rather than in fact. But where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is confined illegally and is therefore entitled to relief, it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry. Obviously, in exercising this power, the court may utilize familiar procedures, as appropriate, whether these are found in the civil or criminal rules or elsewhere in the ``usages and principles.''

I21Granting discovery is left to the discretion of the court, discretion to be exercised where there is a showing of good cause why discovery should be allowed. Several commentators have suggested that at least some discovery should be permitted without leave of court. It is argued that the courts will be burdened with weighing the propriety of requests to which the discovered party has no objection. Additionally, the availability of protective orders under Fed.R.Civ.R., Rules 30(b) and 31(d) will provide the necessary safeguards. See Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1186ÿ0987 (1970); Civil Discovery in Habeas Corpus, 67 Colum.L.Rev. 1296, 1310 (1967).

I21Nonetheless, it is felt the requirement of prior court approval of all discovery is necessary to prevent abuse, so this requirement is specifically mandated in the rule.

I21While requests for discovery in habeas proceedings normally follow the granting of an evidentiary hearing, there may be instances in which discovery would be appropriate beforehand. Such an approach was advocated in T3Wagner v. United StatesK, 418 F.2d 618, 621 (9th Cir. 1969), where the opinion stated the trial court could permit interrogatories, provide for deposing witnesses, ``and take such other prehearing steps as may be appropriate.'' While this was an action under ÿ1A2255, the reasoning would apply equally well to petitions by state prisoners. Such pre-hearing discovery may show an evidentiary hearing to be unnecessary, as when there are ``no disputed issues of law or fact.'' 83 Harv. L.Rev. 1038, 1181 (1970). The court in Harris alluded to such a possibility when it said ``the court may *** authorize such proceedings with respect to development, T3before or in conjunction with the hearingK of the facts ***.'' [emphasis added] 394 U.S. at 300. Such pre-hearing discovery, like all discovery under rule 6, requires leave of court. In addition, the provisions in rule 7 for the use of an expanded record may eliminate much of the need for this type of discovery. While probably not as frequently sought or granted as discovery in conjunction with a hearing, it may nonetheless serve a valuable function.

I21In order to make pre-hearing discovery meaningful, subdivision (a) provides that the judge should appoint counsel for a petitioner who is without counsel and qualifies for appointment when this is necessary for the proper utilization of discovery procedures. Rule 8 provides for the appointment of counsel at the evidentiary hearing stage (see rule 8(b) and advisory committee note), but this would not assist the petitioner who seeks to utilize discovery to stave off dismissal of his petition (see rule 9 and advisory committee note) or to demonstrate that an evidentiary hearing is necessary. Thus, if the judge grants a petitioner's request for discovery prior to making a decision as to the necessity for an evidentiary hearing, he should determine whether counsel is necessary for the effective utilization of such discovery and, if so, appoint counsel for the petitioner if the petitioner qualifies for such appointment.

I21This rule contains very little specificity as to what types and methods of discovery should be made available to the parties in a habeas proceeding, or how, once made available, these discovery procedures should be administered. The purpose of this rule is to get some experience in how discovery would work in actual practice by letting district court judges fashion their own rules in the context of individual cases. When the results of such experience are available it would be desirable to consider whether further, more specific codification should take place.

I21Subdivision (b) provides for judicial consideration of all matters subject to discovery. A statement of the interrogatories, or requests for admission sought to be answered, and a list of any documents sought to be produced, must accompany a request for discovery. This is to advise the judge of the necessity for discovery and enable him to make certain that the inquiry is relevant and appropriately narrow.

I21Subdivision (c) refers to the situation where the respondent is granted leave to take the deposition of the petitioner or any other person. In such a case the judge may direct the respondent to pay the expenses and fees of counsel for the petitioner to attend the taking of the deposition, as a condition granting the respondent such leave. While the judge is not required to impose this condition subdivision (c) will give the court the means to do so. Such a provision affords some protection to the indigent petitioner who may be prejudiced by his inability to have counsel, often court-appointed, present at the taking of a deposition. It is recognized that under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A(g), court-appointed counsel in a ÿ1A2254 proceeding is entitled to receive up to $250 and reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred. (Compare Fed.R. Crim.P. 15(c).) Typically, however, this does not adequately reimburse counsel if he must attend the taking of depositions or be involved in other pre-hearing proceedings. Subdivision (c) is intended to provide additional funds, if necessary, to be paid by the state government (respondent) to petitioner's counsel.

I21Although the rule does not specifically so provide, it is assumed that a petitioner who qualifies for the appointment of counsel under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A(g) and is granted leave to take a deposition will be allowed witness costs. This will include recording and transcription of the witness's statement. Such costs are payable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1825. See Opinion of Comptroller General, February 28, 1974.

I21Subdivision (c) specifically recognizes the right of the respondent to take the deposition of the petitioner. Although the petitioner could not be called to testify against his will in a criminal trial, it is felt the nature of the habeas proceeding, along with the safeguards accorded by the Fifth Amendment and the presence of counsel, justify this provision. See 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1183ÿ0984 (1970).

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 6 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21Although current Rule 6(b) contains no requirement that the parties provide reasons for the requested discovery, the revised rule does so and also includes a requirement that the request be accompanied by any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents. The Committee believes that the revised rule makes explicit what has been implicit in current practice.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. Rule 6(b) was modified to require that discovery requests be supported by reasons, to assist the court in deciding what, if any, discovery should take place. The Committee believed that the change made explicit what has been implicit in current practice.

I81Rule 7. Expanding the Record

I11(a) T4In GeneralK. If the petition is not dismissed, the judge may direct the parties to expand the record by submitting additional materials relating to the petition. The judge may require that these materials be authenticated.

I11(b) T4Types of MaterialsK. The materials that may be required include letters predating the filing of the petition, documents, exhibits, and answers under oath to written interrogatories propounded by the judge. Affidavits may also be submitted and considered as part of the record.

I11(c) T4Review by the Opposing PartyK. The judge must give the party against whom the additional materials are offered an opportunity to admit or deny their correctness.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21This rule provides that the judge may direct that the record be expanded. The purpose is to enable the judge to dispose of some habeas petitions not dismissed on the pleadings, without the time and expense required for an evidentiary hearing. An expanded record may also be helpful when an evidentiary hearing is ordered.

I21The record may be expanded to include additional material relevant to the merits of the petition. While most petitions are dismissed either summarily or after a response has been made, of those that remain, by far the majority require an evidentiary hearing. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, for example, of 8,423 ÿ1A2254 cases terminated, 8,231 required court action. Of these, 7,812 were dismissed before a prehearing conference and 469 merited further court action (T3e.gK., expansion of the record, prehearing conference, or an evidentiary hearing). Of the remaining 469 cases, 403 required an evidentiary hearing, often time-consuming, costly, and, at least occasionally, unnecessary. See Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report, 245aÿ09245c (table C4) (1970). In some instances these hearings were necessitated by slight omissions in the state record which might have been cured by the use of an expanded record.

I21Authorizing expansion of the record will, hopefully, eliminate some unnecessary hearings. The value of this approach was articulated in T3Raines v. United StatesK, 423 F.2d 526, 529ÿ09530 (4th Cir. 1970):

I22Unless it is clear from the pleadings and the files and records that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the statute makes a hearing mandatory. We think there is a permissible intermediate step that may avoid the necessity for an expensive and time consuming evidentiary hearing in every Section 2255 case. It may instead be perfectly appropriate, depending upon the nature of the allegations, for the district court to proceed by requiring that the record be expanded to include letters, documentary evidence, and, in an appropriate case, even affidavits. T3United States v. CarlinoK, 400 F.2d 56 (2nd Cir. 1968); T3Mirra v. United StatesK, 379 F.2d 782 (2nd Cir. 1967); T3Accardi v. United StatesK, 379 F.2d 312 (2nd Cir. 1967). When the issue is one of credibility, resolution on the basis of affidavits can rarely be conclusive, but that is not to say they may not be helpful.

I21In T3Harris v. NelsonK, 394 U.S. 286, 300 (1969), the court said:

I22At any time in the proceedings *** T3either on [the court's] own motionK or upon cause shown by the petitioner, it may issue such writs and take or authorize such proceedings *** T3beforeK or in conjunction with the hearing of the facts *** [emphasis added]

I21Subdivision (b) specifies the materials which may be added to the record. These include, without limitation, letters predating the filing of the petition in the district court, documents, exhibits, and answers under oath directed to written interrogatories propounded by the judge. Under this subdivision affidavits may be submitted and considered part of the record. Subdivision (b) is consistent with 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2246 and 2247 and the decision in T3RainesK with regard to types of material that may be considered upon application for a writ of habeas corpus. See T3United States v. CarlinoK, 400 F.2d 56, 58 (2d Cir. 1968), and T3Machibroda v. United StatesK, 368 U.S. 487 (1962).

I21Under subdivision (c) all materials proposed to be included in the record must be submitted to the party against whom they are to be offered.

I21Under subdivision (d) the judge can require authentication if he believes it desirable to do so.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 7 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as noted below.

I21Revised Rule 7(a) is not intended to restrict the court's authority to expand the record through means other than requiring the parties themselves to provide the information. Further, the rule has been changed to remove the reference to the ``merits'' of the petition in the recognition that a court may wish to expand the record in order to assist it in deciding an issue other than the merits of the petition.

I21The language in current Rule 7(d), which deals with authentication of materials in the expanded record, has been moved to revised Rule 7(a).

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee modified Rule 7(a) by removing the reference to the ``merits'' of the petition. One commentator had commented that the court might wish to expand the record for purposes other than the merits of the case. The Committee agreed to the change and also changed the rule to reflect that someone other than a party may authenticate the materials.

I81Rule 8. Evidentiary Hearing

I11(a) T4Determining Whether to Hold a HearingK. If the petition is not dismissed, the judge must review the answer, any transcripts and records of state-court proceedings, and any materials submitted under Rule 7 to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted.

I11(b) T4Reference to a Magistrate JudgeK. A judge may, under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636(b), refer the petition to a magistrate judge to conduct hearings and to file proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition. When they are filed, the clerk must promptly serve copies of the proposed findings and recommendations on all parties. Within 14 days after being served, a party may file objections as provided by local court rule. The judge must determine de novo any proposed finding or recommendation to which objection is made. The judge may accept, reject, or modify any proposed finding or recommendation.

I11(c) T4Appointing Counsel; Time of HearingK. If an evidentiary hearing is warranted, the judge must appoint an attorney to represent a petitioner who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A. The judge must conduct the hearing as soon as practicable after giving the attorneys adequate time to investigate and prepare. These rules do not limit the appointment of counsel under ÿ1A3006A at any stage of the proceeding.

I53(As amended Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(5), Sept. 28, 1976, 90 Stat. 1334; Pub. L. 94ÿ09577, ÿ1A2(a)(1), (b)(1), Oct. 21, 1976, 90 Stat. 2730, 2731; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21This rule outlines the procedure to be followed by the court immediately prior to and after the determination of whether to hold an evidentiary hearing.

I21The provisions are applicable if the petition has not been dismissed at a previous stage in the proceeding [including a summary dismissal under rule 4; a dismissal pursuant to a motion by the respondent; a dismissal after the answer and petition are considered; or a dismissal after consideration of the pleadings and an expanded record].

I21If dismissal has not been ordered, the court must determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required. This determination is to be made upon a review of the answer, the transcript and record of state court proceedings, and if there is one, the expanded record. As the United States Supreme Court noted in T3Townsend v. SamK, 372 U.S. 293, 319 (1963):

I31Ordinarily [the complete state-court] record_including the transcript of testimony (or if unavailable some adequate substitute, such as a narrative record), the pleadings, court opinions, and other pertinent documents_is indispensable to determining whether the habeas applicant received a full and fair state-court evidentiary hearing resulting in reliable findings.

I21Subdivision (a) contemplates that all of these materials, if available, will be taken into account. This is especially important in view of the standard set down in T3TownsendK for determining T3whenK a hearing in the federal habeas proceeding is mandatory.

I31The appropriate standard *** is this: Where the facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.

I71372 U.S. at 312

I21The circumstances under which a federal hearing is mandatory are now specified in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254(d). The 1966 amendment clearly places the burden on the petitioner, when there has already been a state hearing, to show that it was not a fair or adequate hearing for one or more of the specifically enumerated reasons, in order to force a federal evidentiary hearing. Since the function of an evidentiary hearing is to try issues of fact (372 U.S. at 309), such a hearing is unnecessary when only issues of law are raised. See, T3e.g., Yeaman v. United StatesK, 326 F.2d 293 (9th Cir. 1963).

I21In situations in which an evidentiary hearing is not mandatory, the judge may nonetheless decide that an evidentiary hearing is desirable:

I31The purpose of the test is to indicate the situations in which the holding of an evidentiary hearing is mandatory. In all other cases where the material facts are in dispute, the holding of such a hearing is in the discretion of the district judge.

I71372 U.S. at 318

I21If the judge decides that an evidentiary hearing is neither required nor desirable, he shall make such a disposition of the petition ``as justice shall require.'' Most habeas petitions are dismissed before the prehearing conference stage (see Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report 245aÿ09245c (table C4) (1970)) and of those not dismissed, the majority raise factual issues that necessitate an evidentiary hearing. If no hearing is required, most petitions are dismissed, but in unusual cases the court may grant the relief sought without a hearing. This includes immediate release from custody or nullification of a judgment under which the sentence is to be served in the future.

I21Subdivision (b) provides that a magistrate, when so empowered by rule of the district court, may recommend to the district judge that an evidentiary hearing be held or that the petition be dismissed, provided he gives the district judge a sufficiently detailed description of the facts so that the judge may decide whether or not to hold an evidentiary hearing. This provision is not inconsistent with the holding in T3Wingo v. WeddingK, 418 U.S. 461 (1974), that the Federal Magistrates Act did not change the requirement of the habeas corpus statute that federal judges personally conduct habeas evidentiary hearings, and that consequently a local district court rule was invalid insofar as it authorized a magistrate to hold such hearings. 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636(b) provides that a district court may by rule authorize any magistrate to perform certain additional duties, including preliminary review of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses, and submission of a report and recommendations to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdiction over the case as to whether there should be a hearing.

I33As noted in T3WingoK, review ``by Magistrates of applications for post-trial relief is thus limited to review for the purpose of proposing, not holding, evidentiary hearings.''

I21Utilization of the magistrate as specified in subdivision (b) will aid in the expeditious and fair handling of habeas petitions.

I22A qualified, experienced magistrate will, it is hoped, acquire an expertise in examining these [postconviction review] applications and summarizing their important contents for the district judge, thereby facilitating his decisions. Law clerks are presently charged with this responsibility by many judges, but judges have noted that the normal 1-year clerkship does not afford law clerks the time or experience necessary to attain real efficiency in handling such applications.

I71S. Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1967)

I21Under subdivision (c) there are two provisions that differ from the procedure set forth in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243. These are the appointment of counsel and standard for determining how soon the hearing will be held.

I21If an evidentiary hearing is required the judge must appoint counsel for a petitioner who qualified for appointment under the Criminal Justice Act. Currently, the appointment of counsel is not recognized as a right at any stage of a habeas proceeding. See, T3e.g., United States ex rel. Marshall v. WilkinsK, 338 F.2d 404 (2d Cir. 1964). Some district courts have, however, by local rule, required that counsel must be provided for indigent petitioners in cases requiring a hearing. See, T3e.gK., D.N.M.R. 21(f), E.D. N.Y.R. 26(d). Appointment of counsel at this stage is mandatory under subdivision (c). This requirement will not limit the authority of the court to provide counsel at an earlier stage if it is thought desirable to do so as is done in some courts under current practice. At the evidentiary hearing stage, however, an indigent petitioner's access to counsel should not depend on local practice and, for this reason, the furnishing of counsel is made mandatory.

I21Counsel can perform a valuable function benefiting both the court and the petitioner. The issues raised can be more clearly identified if both sides have the benefit of trained legal personnel. The presence of counsel at the prehearing conference may help to expedite the evidentiary hearing or make it unnecessary, and counsel will be able to make better use of available prehearing discovery procedures. Compare ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies ÿ1A4.4, p. 66 (Approved Draft 1968). At a hearing, the petitioner's claims are more likely to be effectively and properly presented by counsel.

I21Under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A(g), payment is allowed counsel up to $250, plus reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred. The standards of indigency under this section are less strict than those regarding eligibility to prosecute a petition in forma pauperis, and thus many who cannot qualify to proceed under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1915 will be entitled to the benefits of counsel under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A(g). Under rule 6(c), the court may order the respondent to reimburse counsel from state funds for fees and expenses incurred as the result of the utilization of discovery procedures by the respondent.

I21Subdivision (c) provides that the hearing shall be conducted as promptly as possible, taking into account ``the need of counsel for both parties for adequate time for investigation and preparation.'' This differs from the language of 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243, which requires that the day for the hearing be set ``not more than five days after the return unless for good cause additional time is allowed.'' This time limit fails to take into account the function that may be served by a prehearing conference and the time required to prepare adequately for an evidentiary hearing. Although ``additional time'' is often allowed under ÿ1A2243, subdivision (c) provides more flexibility to take account of the complexity of the case, the availability of important materials, the workload of the attorney general, and the time required by appointed counsel to prepare.

I21While the rule does not make specific provision for a prehearing conference, the omission is not intended to cast doubt upon the value of such a conference:

I31The conference may limit the questions to be resolved, identify areas of agreement and dispute, and explore evidentiary problems that may be expected to arise. *** [S]uch conferences may also disclose that a hearing is unnecessary ***.

I21The rule does not contain a specific provision on the subpoenaing of witnesses. It is left to local practice to determine the method for doing this. The implementation of 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1825 on the payment of witness fees is dealt with in an opinion of the Comptroller General, February 28, 1974.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 8 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21Rule 8(a) is not intended to supersede the restrictions on evidentiary hearings contained in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254(e)(2).

I21The requirement in current Rule 8(b)(2) that a copy of the magistrate judge's findings must be promptly mailed to all parties has been changed in revised Rule 8(b) to require that copies of those findings be served on all parties. As used in this rule, ``service'' means service consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b), which allows mailing the copies.

I81Rule 9. Second or Successive Petitions

I11Before presenting a second or successive petition, the petitioner must obtain an order from the appropriate court of appeals authorizing the district court to consider the petition as required by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(b)(3) and (4).

I53(As amended Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(7), (8), Sept. 28, 1976, 90 Stat. 1335; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21This rule is intended to minimize abuse of the writ of habeas corpus by limiting the right to assert stale claims and to file multiple petitions. Subdivision (a) deals with the delayed petition. Subdivision (b) deals with the second or successive petition.

I21Subdivision (a) provides that a petition attacking the judgment of a state court may be dismissed on the grounds of delay if the petitioner knew or should have known of the existence of the grounds he is presently asserting in the petition and the delay has resulted in the state being prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition. If the delay is more than five years after the judgment of conviction, prejudice is presumed, although this presumption is rebuttable by the petitioner. Otherwise, the state has the burden of showing such prejudice.

I21The assertion of stale claims is a problem which is not likely to decrease in frequency. Following the decisions in T3Jones v. CunninghamK, 371 U.S. 236 (1963), and T3Benson v. CaliforniaK, 328 F.2d 159 (9th Cir. 1964), the concept of custody expanded greatly, lengthening the time period during which a habeas corpus petition may be filed. The petitioner who is not unconditionally discharged may be on parole or probation for many years. He may at some date, perhaps ten or fifteen years after conviction, decide to challenge the state court judgment. The grounds most often troublesome to the courts are ineffective counsel, denial of right of appeal, plea of guilty unlawfully induced, use of a coerced confession, and illegally constituted jury. The latter four grounds are often interlocked with the allegation of ineffective counsel. When they are asserted after the passage of many years, both the attorney for the defendant and the state have difficulty in ascertaining what the facts are. It often develops that the defense attorney has little or no recollection as to what took place and that many of the participants in the trial are dead or their whereabouts unknown. The court reporter's notes may have been lost or destroyed, thus eliminating any exact record of what transpired. If the case was decided on a guilty plea, even if the record is intact, it may not satisfactorily reveal the extent of the defense attorney's efforts in behalf of the petitioner. As a consequence, there is obvious difficulty in investigating petitioner's allegations.

I21The interest of both the petitioner and the government can best be served if claims are raised while the evidence is still fresh. The American Bar Association has recognized the interest of the state in protecting itself against stale claims by limiting the right to raise such claims after completion of service of a sentence imposed pursuant to a challenged judgment. See ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies ÿ1A2.4 (c), p. 45 (Approved Draft, 1968). Subdivision (a) is not limited to those who have completed their sentence. Its reach is broader, extending to all instances where delay by the petitioner has prejudiced the state, subject to the qualifications and conditions contained in the subdivision.

I21In T3McMann v. RichardsonK, 397 U.S. 759 (1970), the court made reference to the issue of the stale claim:

I22What is at stake in this phase of the case is not the integrity of the state convictions obtained on guilty pleas, T3but whether, years laterK, defendants must be permitted to withdraw their pleas, which were perfectly valid when made, and be given another choice between admitting their guilt and putting the State to its proof. [Emphasis added.]

I71397 U.S. at 773

I21The court refused to allow this, intimating its dislike of collateral attacks on sentences long since imposed which disrupt the state's interest in finality of convictions which were constitutionally valid when obtained.

I21Subdivision (a) is not a statute of limitations. Rather, the limitation is based on the equitable doctrine of laches. ``Laches is such delay in enforcing one's rights as works disadvantage to another.'' 30A C.J.S. Equity ÿ1A112, p. 19. Also, the language of the subdivision, ``a petition T3mayK be dismissed'' [emphasis added], is permissive rather than mandatory. This clearly allows the court which is considering the petition to use discretion in assessing the equities of the particular situation.

I21The use of a flexible rule analogous to laches to bar the assertion of stale claims is suggested in ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies ÿ1A2.4, commentary at 48 (Approved Draft, 1968). Additionally, in T3Fay v. NoiaK, 372 U.S. 391 (1963), the Supreme Court noted:

I31Furthermore, habeas corpus has traditionally been regarded as governed by equitable principles. T3United States ex rel. Smith v. BaldiK, 344 U.S. 561, 573 (dissenting opinion). Among them is the principle that a suitor's conduct in relation to the matter at hand may disentitle him to the relief he seeks.

I71372 U.S. at 438

I21Finally, the doctrine of laches has been applied with reference to another postconviction remedy, the writ of coram nobis. See 24 C.J.S. Criminal Law ÿ1A1606(25), p. 779.

I21The standard used for determining if the petitioner shall be barred from asserting his claim is consistent with that used in laches provisions generally. The petitioner is held to a standard of reasonable diligence. Any inference or presumption arising by reason of the failure to attack collaterally a conviction may be disregarded where (1) there has been a change of law or fact (new evidence) or (2) where the court, in the interest of justice, feels that the collateral attack should be entertained and the prisoner makes a proper showing as to why he has not asserted a particular ground for relief.

I21Subdivision (a) establishes the presumption that the passage of more than five years from the time of the judgment of conviction to the time of filing a habeas petition is prejudicial to the state. ``Presumption'' has the meaning given it by Fed.R.Evid. 301. The prisoner has ``the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption'' that the state has not been prejudiced by the passage of a substantial period of time. This does not impose too heavy a burden on the petitioner. He usually knows what persons are important to the issue of whether the state has been prejudiced. Rule 6 can be used by the court to allow petitioner liberal discovery to learn whether witnesses have died or whether other circumstances prejudicial to the state have occurred. Even if the petitioner should fail to overcome the presumption of prejudice to the state, he is not automatically barred from asserting his claim. As discussed previously, he may proceed if he neither knew nor, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have known of the grounds for relief.

I21The presumption of prejudice does not come into play if the time lag is not more than five years.

I21The time limitation should have a positive effect in encouraging petitioners who have knowledge of it to assert all their claims as soon after conviction as possible. The implementation of this rule can be substantially furthered by the development of greater legal resources for prisoners. See ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies ÿ1A3.1, pp. 49ÿ0950 (Approved Draft, 1968).

I21Subdivision (a) does not constitute an abridgement or modification of a substantive right under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2072. There are safeguards for the hardship case. The rule provides a flexible standard for determining when a petition will be barred.

I21Subdivision (b) deals with the problem of successive habeas petitions. It provides that the judge may dismiss a second or successive petition (1) if it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief or (2) if new or different grounds for relief are alleged and the judge finds the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition is inexcusable.

I21In T3Sanders v. United StatesK, 373 U.S. 1 (1963), the court, in dealing with the problem of successive applications, stated:

I22Controlling weight T3mayK be given to denial of a prior application for federal habeas corpus or ÿ1A2255 relief only if (1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application. [Emphasis added.]

I71373 U.S. at 15

I21The requirement is that the prior determination of the same ground has been on the merits. This requirement is in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(b) and has been reiterated in many cases since T3SandersK. See T3Gains v. AllgoodK, 391 F.2d 692 (5th Cir. 1968); T3Hutchinson v. CravenK, 415 F.2d 278 (9th Cir. 1969); T3Brown v. PeytonK, 435 F.2d 1352 (4th Cir. 1970).

I21With reference to a successive application asserting a new ground or one not previously decided on the merits, the court in T3SandersK noted:

I31In either case, full consideration of the merits of the new application can be avoided only if there has been an abuse of the writ *** and this the Government has the burden of pleading. ***

I22Thus, for example, if a prisoner deliberately withholds one of two grounds for federal collateral relief at the time of filing his first application, *** he may be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on a second application presenting the withheld ground.

I71373 U.S. at 17ÿ0918

I33Subdivision (b) has incorporated this principle and requires that the judge find petitioner's failure to have asserted the new grounds in the prior petition to be inexcusable.

I21T3SandersK, 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244, and subdivision (b) make it clear that the court has discretion to entertain a successive application.

I21The burden is on the government to plead abuse of the writ. See T3Sanders v. United StatesK, 373 U.S. 1, 10 (1963); T3Dixon v. JacobsK, 427 F.2d 589, 596 (D.C.Cir. 1970); cf. T3Johnson v. CopingerK, 420 F.2d 395 (4th Cir. 1969). Once the government has done this, the petitioner has the burden of proving that he has not abused the writ. In T3Price v. JohnstonK, 334 U.S. 266, 292 (1948), the court said:

I31[I]f the Government chooses *** to claim that the prisoner has abused the writ of T3habeas corpusK, it rests with the Government to make that claim with clarity and particularity in its return to the order to show cause. That is not an intolerable burden. The Government is usually well acquainted with the facts that are necessary to make such a claim. Once a particular abuse has been alleged, the prisoner has the burden of answering that allegation and of proving that he has not abused the writ.

I21Subdivision (b) is consistent with the important and well established purpose of habeas corpus. It does not eliminate a remedy to which the petitioner is rightfully entitled. However, in T3SandersK, the court pointed out:

I31Nothing in the traditions of habeas corpus requires the federal courts to tolerate needless piecemeal litigation, or to entertain collateral proceedings whose only purpose is to vex, harass, or delay.

I71373 U.S. at 18

I33There are instances in which petitioner's failure to assert a ground in a prior petition is excusable. A retroactive change in the law and newly discovered evidence are examples. In rare instances, the court may feel a need to entertain a petition alleging grounds that have already been decided on the merits. T3SandersK, 373 U.S. at 1, 16. However, abusive use of the writ should be discouraged, and instances of abuse are frequent enough to require a means of dealing with them. For example, a successive application, already decided on the merits, may be submitted in the hope of getting before a different judge in multijudge courts. A known ground may be deliberately withheld in the hope of getting two or more hearings or in the hope that delay will result in witnesses and records being lost. There are instances in which a petitioner will have three or four petitions pending at the same time in the same court. There are many hundreds of cases where the application is at least the second one by the petitioner. This subdivision is aimed at screening out the abusive petitions from this large volume, so that the more meritorious petitions can get quicker and fuller consideration.

I21The form petition, supplied in accordance with rule 2(c), encourages the petitioner to raise all of his available grounds in one petition. It sets out the most common grounds asserted so that these may be brought to his attention.

I21Some commentators contend that the problem of abuse of the writ of habeas corpus is greatly overstated:

I22Most prisoners, of course, are interested in being released as soon as possible; only rarely will one inexcusably neglect to raise all available issues in his first federal application. The purpose of the ``abuse'' bar is apparently to deter repetitious applications from those few bored or vindictive prisoners ***.

I7183 Harv.L.Rev. at 1153ÿ091154

I33See also ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies ÿ1A6.2, commentary at 92 (Approved Draft, 1968), which states: ``The occasional, highly litigious prisoner stands out as the rarest exception.'' While no recent systematic study of repetitious applications exists, there is no reason to believe that the problem has decreased in significance in relation to the total number of ÿ1A2254 petitions filed. That number has increased from 584 in 1949 to 12,088 in 1971. See Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report, table 16 (1971). It is appropriate that action be taken by rule to allow the courts to deal with this problem, whatever its specific magnitude. The bar set up by subdivision (b) is not one of rigid application, but rather is within the discretion of the courts on a case-by-case basis.

I21If it appears to the court after examining the petition and answer (where appropriate) that there is a high probability that the petition will be barred under either subdivision of rule 9, the court ought to afford petitioner an opportunity to explain his apparent abuse. One way of doing this is by the use of the form annexed hereto. The use of a form will ensure a full airing of the issue so that the court is in a better position to decide whether the petition should be barred. This conforms with T3Johnson v. CopingerK, 420 F.2d 395 (4th Cir. 1969), where the court stated:

I31[T]he petitioner is obligated to present facts demonstrating that his earlier failure to raise his claims is excusable and does not amount to an abuse of the writ. However, it is inherent in this obligation placed upon the petitioner that he must be given an opportunity to make his explanation, if he has one. If he is not afforded such an opportunity, the requirement that he satisfy the court that he has not abused the writ is meaningless. Nor do we think that a procedure which allows the imposition of a forfeiture for abuse of the writ, without allowing the petitioner an opportunity to be heard on the issue, comports with the minimum requirements of fairness.

I71420 F.2d at 399

I33Use of the recommended form will contribute to an orderly handling of habeas petitions and will contribute to the ability of the court to distinguish the excusable from the inexcusable delay or failure to assert a ground for relief in a prior petition.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 9 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as noted below.

I21First, current Rule 9(a) has been deleted as unnecessary in light of the applicable one-year statute of limitations for ÿ1A2254 petitions, added as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d).

I21Second, current Rule 9(b), now Rule 9, has been changed to also reflect provisions in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(b)(3) and (4), which now require a petitioner to obtain approval from the appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive petition.

I21Finally, the title of Rule 9 has been changed to reflect the fact that the only topic now addressed in the rules is that of second or successive petitions.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee made no changes to Rule 9.

I74Amendments by Public Law

I211976_Subd. (a). Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(7), struck out provision which established a rebuttable presumption of prejudice to the state if the petition was filed more than five years after conviction and started the running of the five year period, where a petition challenged the validity of an action after conviction, from the time of the order of such action.

I21Subd. (b). Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(8), substituted ``constituted an abuse of the writ'' for ``is not excusable''.

I81Rule 10. Powers of a Magistrate Judge

I11A magistrate judge may perform the duties of a district judge under these rules, as authorized under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636.

I53(As amended Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(11), Sept. 28, 1976, 90 Stat. 1335; Apr. 30, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Under this rule the duties imposed upon the judge of the district court by rules 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 may be performed by a magistrate if and to the extent he is empowered to do so by a rule of the district court. However, when such duties involve the making of an order under rule 4 disposing of the petition, that order must be made by the court. The magistrate in such instances must submit to the court his report as to the facts and his recommendation with respect to the order.

I21The Federal Magistrates Act allows magistrates, when empowered by local rule, to perform certain functions in proceedings for post-trial relief. See 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636(b)(3). The performance of such functions, when authorized, is intended to ``afford some degree of relief to district judges and their law clerks, who are presently burdened with burgeoning numbers of habeas corpus petitions and applications under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255.'' Committee on the Judiciary, The Federal Magistrates Act, S.Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st sess., 26 (1967).

I21Under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636(b), any district court,

I31by the concurrence of a majority of all the judges of such district court, may establish rules pursuant to which any full-time United States magistrate *** may be assigned within the territorial jurisdiction of such court such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.

I33The proposed rule recognizes the limitations imposed by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636(b) upon the powers of magistrates to act in federal postconviction proceedings. These limitations are: (1) that the magistrate may act only pursuant to a rule passed by the majority of the judges in the district court in which the magistrate serves, and (2) that the duties performed by the magistrate pursuant to such rule be consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.

I21It has been suggested that magistrates be empowered by law to hold hearings and make final decisions in habeas proceedings. See Proposed Reformation of Federal Habeas Corpus Procedure: Use of Federal Magistrates, 54 Iowa L.Rev. 1147, 1158 (1969). However, the Federal Magistrates Act does not authorize such use of magistrates. T3Wingo v. WeddingK, 418 U.S. 461 (1974). See advisory committee note to rule 8. While the use of magistrates can help alleviate the strain imposed on the district courts by the large number of unmeritorious habeas petitions, neither 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636(b) nor this rule contemplate the abdication by the court of its decision-making responsibility. See also Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L.Rev. 1038, 1188 (1970)

I21Where a full-time magistrate is not available, the duties contemplated by this rule may be assigned to a part-time magistrate.

I711979 T4Amendment

I21This amendment conforms the rule to subsequently enacted legislation clarifying and further defining the duties which may be assigned to a magistrate, 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A636, as amended in 1976 by Pub. L. 94ÿ09577. To the extent that rule 10 is more restrictive than ÿ1A636, the limitations are of no effect, for the statute expressly governs ``[n]otwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary.''

I21The reference to particular rules is stricken, as under ÿ1A636(b)(1)(A) a judge may designate a magistrate to perform duties under other rules as well (e.g., order that further transcripts be furnished under rule 5; appoint counsel under rule 8). The reference to ``established standards and criteria'' is stricken, as ÿ1A636(4) requires each district court to ``establish rules pursuant to which the magistrates shall discharge their duties.'' The exception with respect to a rule 4 order dismissing a petition is stricken, as that limitation appears in ÿ1A636(b)(1)(B) and is thereby applicable to certain other actions under these rules as well (e.g., determination of a need for an evidentiary hearing under rule 8; dismissal of a delayed or successive petition under rule 9).

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee restyled the proposed rule.

I74Amendments by Public Law

I211976_Pub. L. 94ÿ09426 inserted ``,and to the extent the district court has established standards and criteria for the performance of such duties'' after ``rule of the district court''.

I81Rule 11. Certificate of Appealability; Time to Appeal

I11(a) T4Certificate of AppealabilityK. The district court must issue or deny a certificate of appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the applicant. Before entering the final order, the court may direct the parties to submit arguments on whether a certificate should issue. If the court issues a certificate, the court must state the specific issue or issues that satisfy the showing required by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2253(c)(2). If the court denies a certificate, the parties may not appeal the denial but may seek a certificate from the court of appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22. A motion to reconsider a denial does not extend the time to appeal.

I11(b) T4Time to AppealK. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) governs the time to appeal an order entered under these rules. A timely notice of appeal must be filed even if the district court issues a certificate of appealability.

I53(As added Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12009

I21T3Subdivision (a).K As provided in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2253(c), an applicant may not appeal to the court of appeals from a final order in a proceeding under ÿ1A2254 unless a judge issues a certificate of appealability (COA), identifying the specific issues for which the applicant has made a substantial showing of a denial of constitutional right. New Rule 11(a) makes the requirements concerning COAs more prominent by adding and consolidating them in the appropriate rule of the Rules Governing ÿ1A2254 Cases in the United States District Courts. Rule 11(a) also requires the district judge to grant or deny the certificate at the time a final order is issued. T3SeeK 3d Cir. R. 22.2, 111.3. This will ensure prompt decision making when the issues are fresh, rather than postponing consideration of the certificate until after a notice of appeal is filed. These changes will expedite proceedings, avoid unnecessary remands, and help inform the applicant's decision whether to file a notice of appeal.

I21T3Subdivision (b).K The new subdivision is designed to direct parties to the appropriate rule governing the timing of the notice of appeal and make it clear that the district court's grant of a COA does not eliminate the need to file a notice of appeal.

I21T3Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public CommentK. In response to public comments, a sentence was added stating that prior to the entry of the final order the district court may direct the parties to submit arguments on whether or not a certificate should issue. This allows a court in complex cases (such as death penalty cases with numerous claims) to solicit briefing that might narrow the issues for appeal. For purposes of clarification, two sentences were added at the end of subdivision (a) stating that (1) although the district court's denial of a certificate is not appealable, a certificate may be sought in the court of appeals, and (2) a motion for reconsideration of a denial of a certificate does not extend the time to appeal.

I21Finally, a new subdivision (b) was added to mirror the information provided in subdivision (b) of Rule 11 of the Rules Governing ÿ1A2255 Proceedings, directing petitioners to Rule 4 of the appellate rules and indicating that notice of appeal must be filed even if a COA is issued.

I21Minor changes were also made to conform to style conventions.

I81Rule 12. Applicability of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

I11The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with any statutory provisions or these rules, may be applied to a proceeding under these rules.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Habeas corpus proceedings are characterized as civil in nature. See T3e.g., Fisher v. BakerK, 203 U.S. 174, 181 (1906). However, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(2), the applicability of the civil rules to habeas corpus actions has been limited, although the various courts which have considered this problem have had difficulty in setting out the boundaries of this limitation. See T3Harris v. NelsonK, 394 U.S. 286 (1969) at 289, footnote 1. Rule 11 is intended to conform with the Supreme Court's approach in the T3HarrisK case. There the court was dealing with the petitioner's contention that Civil Rule 33 granting the right to discovery via written interrogatories is wholly applicable to habeas corpus proceedings. The court held:

I31We agree with the Ninth Circuit that Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not applicable to habeas corpus proceedings and that 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2246 does not authorize interrogatories except in limited circumstances not applicable to this case; but we conclude that, in appropriate circumstances, a district court, confronted by a petition for habeas corpus which establishes a prima facie case for relief, may use or authorize the use of suitable discovery procedures, including interrogatories, reasonably fashioned to elicit facts necessary to help the court to ``dispose of the matter as law and justice require'' 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243.

I71394 U.S. at 290

I33The court then went on to consider the contention that the ``conformity'' provision of Rule 81(a)(2) should be rigidly applied so that the civil rules would be applicable only to the extent that habeas corpus practice had conformed to the practice in civil actions at the time of the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on September 16, 1938. The court said:

I31Although there is little direct evidence, relevant to the present problem, of the purpose of the ``conformity'' provision of Rule 81(a)(2), the concern of the draftsmen, as a general matter, seems to have been to provide for the continuing applicability of the ``civil'' rules in their new form to those areas of practice in habeas corpus and other enumerated proceedings in which the ``specified'' proceedings had theretofore utilized the modes of civil practice. Otherwise, those proceedings were to be considered outside of the scope of the rules without prejudice, of course, to the use of particular rules by analogy or otherwise, where appropriate.

I71394 U.S. at 294

I33The court then reiterated its commitment to judicial discretion in formulating rules and procedures for habeas corpus proceedings by stating:

I31[T]he habeas corpus jurisdiction and the duty to exercise it being present, the courts may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage.

I33Where their duties require it, this is the inescapable obligation of the courts. Their authority is expressly confirmed in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1651.

I71394 U.S. at 299

I21Rule 6 of these proposed rules deals specifically with the issue of discovery in habeas actions in a manner consistent with T3HarrisK. Rule 11 extends this approach to allow the court considering the petition to use any of the rules of civil procedure (unless inconsistent with these rules of habeas corpus) when in its discretion the court decides they are appropriate under the circumstances of the particular case. The court does not have to rigidly apply rules which would be inconsistent or inequitable in the overall framework of habeas corpus. Rule 11 merely recognizes and affirms their discretionary power to use their judgment in promoting the ends of justice.

I21Rule 11 permits application of the civil rules only when it would be appropriate to do so. Illustrative of an inappropriate application is that rejected by the Supreme Court in T3Pitchess v. DavisK, 95 S.Ct. 1748 (1975), holding that Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) should not be applied in a habeas case when it would have the effect of altering the statutory exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2254.

I21The language of Rule 11 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee made no changes to Rule 11.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12009K Amendment

I21The amendment renumbers current Rule 11 to accommodate the new rule on certificates of appealability.

I89. Federal custody; remedies on motion attacking sentence

I11(a) A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.

I11(b) Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.

I11(c) A court may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing.

I11(d) An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.

I11(e) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.

I11(f) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from the latest of_

I12(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

I12(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;

I12(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or

I12(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.

Q04

I11(g) Except as provided in section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act, in all proceedings brought under this section, and any subsequent proceedings on review, the court may appoint counsel, except as provided by a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Appointment of counsel under this section shall be governed by section 3006A of title 18.

I11(h) A second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain_

I12(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or

I12(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.

I11(b) a person in custody under a judgment of a state court or another federal court, and subject to future custody under a judgment of the district court, who seeks a determination that:

I12(1) future custody under a judgment of the district court would violate the Constitution or laws of the United States;

I12(2) the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment;

I12(3) the district court's sentence exceeded the maximum allowed by law; or

I12(4) the district court's judgment or sentence is otherwise subject to collateral review.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21The basic scope of this postconviction remedy is prescribed by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255. Under these rules the person seeking relief from federal custody files a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, rather than a petition for habeas corpus. This is consistent with the terminology used in section 2255 and indicates the difference between this remedy and federal habeas for a state prisoner. Also, habeas corpus is available to the person in federal custody if his ``remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.''

I21Whereas sections 2241ÿ092254 (dealing with federal habeas corpus for those in state custody) speak of the district court judge ``issuing the writ'' as the operative remedy, section 2255 provides that, if the judge finds the movant's assertions to be meritorious, he ``shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.'' This is possible because a motion under ÿ1A2255 is a further step in the movant's criminal case and not a separate civil action, as appears from the legislative history of section 2 of S. 20, 80th Congress, the provisions of which were incorporated by the same Congress in title 28 U.S.C. as ÿ1A2255. In reporting S. 20 favorably the Senate Judiciary Committee said (Sen. Rep. 1526, 80th Cong. 2d Sess., p. 2):

I21The two main advantages of such motion remedy over the present habeas corpus are as follows:

I21First, habeas corpus is a separate civil action and not a further step in the criminal case in which petitioner is sentenced (T3Ex parte Tom TongK, 108 U.S. 556, 559 (1883)). It is not a determination of guilt or innocence of the charge upon which petitioner was sentenced. Where a prisoner sustains his right to discharge in habeas corpus, it is usually because some right_such as lack of counsel_has been denied which reflects no determination of his guilt or innocence but affects solely the fairness of his earlier criminal trial. Even under the broad power in the statute ``to dispose of the party as law and justice require'' (28 U.S.C.A., sec. 461), the court or judge is by no means in the same advantageous position in habeas corpus to do justice as would be so if the matter were determined in the criminal proceeding (see T3MedleyK, petitioner, 134 U.S. 160, 174 (1890)). For instance, the judge (by habeas corpus) cannot grant a new trial in the criminal case. Since the motion remedy is in the criminal proceeding, this section 2 affords the opportunity and expressly gives the broad powers to set aside the judgment and to ``discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.''

I21The fact that a motion under ÿ1A2255 is a further step in the movant's criminal case rather than a separate civil action has significance at several points in these rules. See, T3e.gK., advisory committee note to rule 3 (re no filing fee), advisory committee note to rule 4 (re availability of files, etc., relating to the judgment), advisory committee note to rule 6 (re availability of discovery under criminal procedure rules), advisory committee note to rule 11 (re no extension of time for appeal), and advisory committee not to rule 12 (re applicability of federal criminal rules). However, the fact that Congress has characterized the motion as a further step in the criminal proceedings does T3notK mean that proceedings upon such a motion are of necessity governed by the legal principles which are applicable at a criminal trial regarding such matters as counsel, presence, confrontation, self-incrimination, and burden of proof.

I21The challenge of decisions such as the revocation of probation or parole are not appropriately dealt with under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255, which is a continuation of the original criminal action. Other remedies, such as habeas corpus, are available in such situations.

I21Although rule 1 indicates that these rules apply to a motion for a determination that the judgment was imposed ``in violation of the ... laws of the United States,'' the language of 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255, it is not the intent of these rules to define or limit what is encompassed within that phrase. See T3Davis v. United StatesK, 417 U.S. 333 (1974), holding that it is not true ``that every asserted error of law can be raised on a ÿ1A2255 motion,'' and that the appropriate inquiry is ``whether the claimed error of law was a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,' and whether [i]t ... present[s] exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent.'ÿ1A''

I21For a discussion of the ``custody'' requirement and the intended limited scope of this remedy, see advisory committee note to ÿ1A2254 rule 1.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 1 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I11(b) T4FormK. The motion must:

I12(1) specify all the grounds for relief available to the moving party;

I12(2) state the facts supporting each ground;

I53(As amended Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(3), (4), Sept. 28, 1976, 90 Stat. 1334; Apr. 28, 1982, eff. Aug. 1, 1982; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Under these rules the application for relief is in the form of a motion rather than a petition (see rule 1 and advisory committee note). Therefore, there is no requirement that the movant name a respondent. This is consistent with 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255. The United States Attorney for the district in which the judgment under attack was entered is the proper party to oppose the motion since the federal government is the movant's adversary of record.

I21If the movant is attacking a federal judgment which will subject him to future custody, he must be in present custody (see rule 1 and advisory committee note) as the result of a state or federal governmental action. He need not alter the nature of the motion by trying to include the government officer who presently has official custody of him as a psuedo-respondent, or third-party plaintiff, or other fabrication. The court hearing his motion attacking the future custody can exercise jurisdiction over those having him in present custody without the use of artificial pleading devices.

I21There is presently a split among the courts as to whether a person currently in state custody may use a ÿ1A2255 motion to obtain relief from a federal judgment under which he will be subjected to custody in the future. Negative, see T3Newton v. United StatesK, 329 F.Supp. 90 (S.D. Texas 1971); affirmative, see T3Desmond v. The United States Board of ParoleK, 397 F.2d 386 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 919 (1968); and T3Paalino v. United StatesK, 314 F.Supp. 875 (C.D.Cal. 1970). It is intended that these rules settle the matter in favor of the prisoner's being able to file a ÿ1A2255 motion for relief under those circumstances. The proper district in which to file such a motion is the one in which is situated the court which rendered the sentence under attack.

I21Under rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court may correct an illegal sentence or a sentence imposed in an illegal manner, or may reduce the sentence. This remedy should be used, rather than a motion under these ÿ1A2255 rules, whenever applicable, but there is some overlap between the two proceedings which has caused the courts difficulty.

I21The movant should not be barred from an appropriate remedy because he has misstyled his motion. See T3United States v. MorganK, 346 U.S. 502, 505 (1954). The court should construe it as whichever one is proper under the circumstances and decide it on its merits. For a ÿ1A2255 motion construed as a rule 35 motion, see T3Heflin v. United StatesK, 358 U.S. 415 (1959); and T3United States v. CokeK, 404 F.2d 836 (2d Cir. 1968). For writ of error coram nobis treated as a rule 35 motion, see T3Hawkins v. United StatesK, 324 F.Supp. 223 (E.D.Texas, Tyler Division 1971). For a rule 35 motion treated as a ÿ1A2255 motion, see T3Moss v. United StatesK, 263 F.2d 615 (5th Cir. 1959); T3Jones v. United StatesK, 400 F.2d 892 (8th Cir. 1968), cert. denied 394 U.S. 991 (1969); and T3United States v. BrownK, 413 F.2d 878 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 947 (1970).

I21One area of difference between ÿ1A2255 and rule 35 motions is that for the latter there is no requirement that the movant be ``in custody.'' T3Heflin v. United StatesK, 358 U.S. 415, 418, 422 (1959); T3Duggins v. United StatesK, 240 F.2d 479, 483 (6th Cir. 1957). Compare with rule 1 and advisory committee note for ÿ1A2255 motions. The importance of this distinction has decreased since T3Peyton v. RoweK, 391 U.S. 54 (1968), but it might still make a difference in particular situations.

I21A rule 35 motion is used to attack the sentence imposed, not the basis for the sentence. The court in T3Gilinsky v. United StatesK, 335 F.2d 914, 916 (9th Cir. 1964), stated, ``a Rule 35 motion presupposes a valid conviction. *** [C]ollateral attack on errors allegedly committed at trial is not permissible under Rule 35.'' By illustration the court noted at page 917: ``a Rule 35 proceeding contemplates the correction of a sentence of a court having jurisdiction. *** [J]urisdictional defects *** involve a collateral attack, they must ordinarily be presented under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255.'' In T3United States v. SemetK, 295 F.Supp. 1084 (E.D. Okla. 1968), the prisoner moved under rule 35 and ÿ1A2255 to invalidate the sentence he was serving on the grounds of his failure to understand the charge to which he pleaded guilty. The court said:

I22As regards Defendant's Motion under Rule 35, said Motion must be denied as its presupposes a valid conviction of the offense with which he was charged and may be used only to attack the sentence. It may not be used to examine errors occurring prior to the imposition of sentence.

I33See also: T3Moss v. United StatesK, 263 F.2d at 616; T3Duggins v. United StatesK, 240 F. 2d at 484; T3Migdal v. United StatesK, 298 F.2d 513, 514 (9th Cir. 1961); T3Jones v. United StatesK, 400 F.2d at 894; T3United States v. CokeK, 404 F.2d at 847; and T3United States v. BrownK, 413 F.2d at 879.

I21A major difficulty in deciding whether rule 35 or ÿ1A2255 is the proper remedy is the uncertainty as to what is meant by an ``illegal sentence.'' The Supreme Court dealt with this issue in T3Hill v. United StatesK, 368 U.S. 424 (1962). The prisoner brought a ÿ1A2255 motion to vacate sentence on the ground that he had not been given a Fed.R.Crim. P. 32(a) opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf at the time of sentencing. The majority held this was not an error subject to collateral attack under ÿ1A2255. The five-member majority considered the motion as one brought pursuant to rule 35, but denied relief, stating:

I31[T]he narrow function of Rule 35 is to permit correction at any time of an illegal T3sentenceK, not to re-examine errors occurring at the trial or other proceedings prior to the imposition of sentence. The sentence in this case was not illegal. The punishment meted out was not in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes, multiple terms were not imposed for the same offense, nor were the terms of the sentence itself legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect.

I71368 U.S. at 430

I33The four dissenters felt the majority definition of ``illegal'' was too narrow.

I31[Rule 35] provides for the correction of an ``illegal sentence'' without regard to the reasons why that sentence is illegal and contains not a single word to support the Court's conclusion that only a sentence illegal by reason of the punishment it imposes is ``illegal'' within the meaning of the Rule. I would have thought that a sentence imposed in an illegal manner_whether the amount or form of the punishment meted out constitutes an additional violation of law or not_would be recognized as an ``illegal sentence'' under any normal reading of the English language.

I71368 U.S. at 431ÿ09432

I33The 1966 amendment of rule 35 added language permitting correction of a sentence imposed in an ``illegal manner.'' However, there is a 120-day time limit on a motion to do this, and the added language does not clarify the intent of the rule or its relation to ÿ1A2255.

I21The courts have been flexible in considering motions under circumstances in which relief might appear to be precluded by T3Hill v. United StatesK. In T3Peterson v. United StatesK, 432 F.2d 545 (8th Cir. 1970), the court was confronted with a motion for reduction of sentence by a prisoner claiming to have received a harsher sentence than his codefendants because he stood trial rather than plead guilty. He alleged that this violated his constitutional right to a jury trial. The court ruled that, even though it was past the 120-day time period for a motion to reduce sentence, the claim was still cognizable under rule 35 as a motion to correct an illegal sentence.

I21The courts have made even greater use of ÿ1A2255 in these types of situations. In T3United States v. LewisK, 392 F.2d 440 (4th Cir. 1968), the prisoner moved under ÿ1A2255 and rule 35 for relief from a sentence he claimed was the result of the judge's misunderstanding of the relevant sentencing law. The court held that he could not get relief under rule 35 because it was past the 120 days for correction of a sentence imposed in an illegal manner and under T3Hill v. United StatesK it was not an illegal sentence. However, ÿ1A2255 was applicable because of its ``otherwise subject to collateral attack'' language. The flaw was not a mere trial error relating to the finding of guilt, but a rare and unusual error which amounted to ``exceptional circumstances'' embraced in ÿ1A2255's words ``collateral attack.'' See 368 U.S. at 444 for discussion of other cases allowing use of ÿ1A2255 to attack the sentence itself in similar circumstances, especially where the judge has sentenced out of a misapprehension of the law.

I21In T3United States v. McCarthyK, 433 F.2d 591, 592 (1st Cir. 1970), the court allowed a prisoner who was past the time limit for a proper rule 35 motion to use ÿ1A2255 to attack the sentence which he received upon a plea of guilty on the ground that it was induced by an unfulfilled promise of the prosecutor to recommend leniency. The court specifically noted that under ÿ1A2255 this was a proper collateral attack on the sentence and there was no need to attack the conviction as well.

I21The court in T3United States v. MalcolmK, 432 F.2d 809, 814, 818 (2d Cir. 1970), allowed a prisoner to challenge his sentence under ÿ1A2255 without attacking the conviction. It held rule 35 inapplicable because the sentence was not illegal on its face, but the manner in which the sentence was imposed raised a question of the denial of due process in the sentencing itself which was cognizable under ÿ1A2255.

I21The flexible approach taken by the courts in the above cases seems to be the reasonable way to handle these situations in which rule 35 and ÿ1A2255 appear to overlap. For a further discussion of this problem, see C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure; Criminal ÿ1A581ÿ09587 (1969, Supp. 1975).

I21See the advisory committee note to rule 2 of the ÿ1A2254 rules for further discussion of the purposes and intent of rule 2 of these ÿ1A2255 rules.

I711982 T4Amendment

I21Subdivision (b). The amendment takes into account 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1746, enacted after adoption of the ÿ1A2255 rules. Section 1746 provides that in lieu of an affidavit an unsworn statement may be given under penalty of perjury in substantially the following form if executed within the United States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: ``I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).'' The statute is ``intended to encompass prisoner litigation,'' and the statutory alternative is especially appropriate in such cases because a notary might not be readily available. T3Carter v. ClarkK, 616 F.2d 228 (5th Cir. 1980). The ÿ1A2255 forms have been revised accordingly.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.

I21Revised Rule 2(b)(5) has been amended by removing the requirement that the motion be signed personally by the moving party. Thus, under the amended rule the motion may be signed by [the] movant personally or by someone acting on behalf of the movant, assuming that the person is authorized to do so, for example, an attorney for the movant. The Committee envisions that the courts would apply third-party, or ``next-friend,'' standing analysis in deciding whether the signer was actually authorized to sign the motion on behalf of the movant. T3See generally Whitmore v. ArkansasK, 495 U.S. 149 (1990) (discussion of requisites for ``next friend'' standing in habeas petitions). T3See alsoK 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2242 (application for state habeas corpus relief may be filed by the person who is seeking relief, or by someone acting on behalf of that person).

I21The language in new Rule 2(c) has been changed to reflect that a moving party must substantially follow the standard form, which is appended to the rules, or a form provided by the court. The current rule, Rule 2(c), seems to indicate a preference for the standard ``national'' form. Under the amended rule, there is no stated preference. The Committee understood that the current practice in some courts is that if the moving party first files a motion using the national form, that courts may ask the moving party to supplement it with the local form.

I21Current Rule 2(d), which provided for returning an insufficient motion[,] has been deleted. The Committee believed that the approach in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e) was more appropriate for dealing with motions that do not conform to the form requirements of the rule. That Rule provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the moving party suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the motion was deemed insufficient. Now that a one-year statute of limitations applies to motions filed under ÿ1A2255, T3seeK 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d)(1), the court's dismissal of a motion because it is not in proper form may pose a significant penalty for a moving party, who may not be able to file another motion within the one-year limitations period. Now, under revised Rule 3(b), the clerk is required to file a motion, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with the provisions in revised Rule 2(b). The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective motion and require the moving party to submit a corrected motion that conforms to Rule 2(b).

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee changed Rule 2(b)(2) to read ``state the facts'' rather then [sic] ``briefly summarize the facts.'' One commentator had written that the current language may actually mislead the petitioner and is also redundant.

I21Rule 2(b)(4) was also modified to reflect that some motions may be printed using a word processing program.

I21Finally, Rule 2(b)(5) was changed to emphasize that any person, other than the petitioner, who signs the petition must be authorized to do so.

I74Amendments

I211976_Subd. (b). Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(3), inserted ``substantially'' after ``The motion shall be in'', and struck out requirement that the motion follow the prescribed form.

I21Subd. (d). Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(4), inserted ``substantially'' after ``district court does not'', and struck out provision which permitted the clerk to return a motion for noncompliance without a judge so directing.

I81Rule 3. Filing the Motion; Inmate Filing

I11(a) T4Where to File; CopiesK. An original and two copies of the motion must be filed with the clerk.

I11(b) T4Filing and ServiceK. The clerk must file the motion and enter it on the criminal docket of the case in which the challenged judgment was entered. The clerk must then deliver or serve a copy of the motion on the United States attorney in that district, together with a notice of its filing.

I11(c) T4Time to FileK. The time for filing a motion is governed by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255 para. 6.

I11(d) T4Inmate FilingK. A paper filed by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if deposited in the institution's internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21There is no filing fee required of a movant under these rules. This is a change from the practice of charging $15 and is done to recognize specifically the nature of a ÿ1A2255 motion as being a continuation of the criminal case whose judgment is under attack.

I21The long-standing practice of requiring a $15 filing fee has followed from 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1914(a) whereby ``parties instituting any civil action *** pay a filing fee of $15, except that on an application for a writ of habeas corpus the filing fee shall be $5.'' This has been held to apply to a proceeding under ÿ1A2255 despite the rationale that such a proceeding is a motion and thus a continuation of the criminal action. (See note to rule 1.)

I22A motion under Section 2255 is a civil action and the clerk has no choice but to charge a $15.00 filing fee unless by leave of court it is filed in forma pauperis.

I21T3McCuneK v. T3United StatesK, 406 F.2d 417, 419 (6th Cir. 1969).

I21Although the motion has been considered to be a new civil action in the nature of habeas corpus for filing purposes, the reduced fee for habeas has been held not applicable. The Tenth Circuit considered the specific issue in T3MartinK v. T3United StatesK, 273 F.2d 775 (10th Cir. 1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 853 (1961), holding that the reduced fee was exclusive to habeas petitions.

I22Counsel for Martin insists that, if a docket fee must be paid, the amount is $5 rather than $15 and bases his contention on the exception contained in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A1914 that in habeas corpus the fee is $5. This reads into ÿ1A1914 language which is not there. While an application under ÿ1A2255 may afford the same relief as that previously obtainable by habeas corpus, it is not a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A change in ÿ1A1914 must come from Congress.

I71273 F.2d at 778

I21Although for most situations ÿ1A2255 is intended to provide to the federal prisoner a remedy equivalent to habeas corpus as used by state prisoners, there is a major distinction between the two. Calling a ÿ1A2255 request for relief a motion rather than a petition militates toward charging no new filing fee, not an increased one. In the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to suppose that Congress did not mean what it said in making a ÿ1A2255 action a motion. Therefore, as in other motions filed in a criminal action, there is no requirement of a filing fee. It is appropriate that the present situation of docketing a ÿ1A2255 motion as a new action and charging a $15 filing fee be remedied by the rule when the whole question of ÿ1A2255 motions is thoroughly thought through and organized.

I21Even though there is no need to have a forma pauperis affidavit to proceed with the action since there is no requirement of a fee for filing the motion the affidavit remains attached to the form to be supplied potential movants. Most such movants are indigent, and this is a convenient way of getting this into the official record so that the judge may appoint counsel, order the government to pay witness fees, allow docketing of an appeal, and grant any other rights to which an indigent is entitled in the course of a ÿ1A2255 motion, when appropriate to the particular situation, without the need for an indigency petition and adjudication at such later point in the proceeding. This should result in a streamlining of the process to allow quicker disposition of these motions.

I21For further discussion of this rule, see the advisory committee note to rule 3 of the ÿ1A2254 rules.

I21Revised Rule 3(b) is new and is intended to parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e), which provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214, the moving party suffered no penalty, other than delay, if the petition was deemed insufficient. That Act, however, added a one-year statute of limitations to motions filed under ÿ1A2255, T3seeK 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2244(d)(1). Thus, a court's dismissal of a defective motion may pose a significant penalty for a moving party who may not be able to file a corrected motion within the one-year limitation period. The Committee believed that the better procedure was to accept the defective motion and require the moving party to submit a corrected motion that conforms to Rule 2. Thus, revised Rule 3(b) requires the clerk to file a motion, even though it may otherwise fail to comply with Rule 2.

I21Revised Rule 3(c), which sets out a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255, paragraph 6, is new and has been added to put moving parties on notice that a one-year statute of limitations applies to motions filed under these Rules. Although the rule does not address the issue, every circuit that has addressed the issue has taken the position that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is available in appropriate circumstances. T3See, e.g., Dunlap v. United StatesK, 250 F.3d 1001, 1004ÿ0907 (6th Cir. 2001); T3Moore v. United StatesK, 173 F.3d 1131, 1133ÿ0935 (8th Cir. 1999); T3Sandvik v. United StatesK, 177 F.3d 1269, 1270ÿ0972 (11th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court has not addressed the question directly. T3See Duncan v. WalkerK, 533 U.S. 167, 181 (2001) (``We ... have no occasion to address the question that Justice Stevens raises concerning the availability of equitable tolling.'').

I21Rule 3(d) is new and provides guidance on determining whether a motion from an inmate is considered to have been filed in a timely fashion. The new provision parallels Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(C).

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee modified the Committee Note to reflect that the clerk must file a motion, even in those instances where the necessary filing fee or in forma pauperis form is not attached. The Note also includes new language concerning the equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.

I81Rule 4. Preliminary Review

I11(a) T4Referral to a JudgeK. The clerk must promptly forward the motion to the judge who conducted the trial and imposed sentence or, if the judge who imposed sentence was not the trial judge, to the judge who conducted the proceedings being challenged. If the appropriate judge is not available, the clerk must forward the motion to a judge under the court's assignment procedure.

I11(b) T4Initial Consideration by the JudgeK. The judge who receives the motion must promptly examine it. If it plainly appears from the motion, any attached exhibits, and the record of prior proceedings that the moving party is not entitled to relief, the judge must dismiss the motion and direct the clerk to notify the moving party. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge must order the United States attorney to file an answer, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take other action the judge may order.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Rule 4 outlines the procedure for assigning the motion to a specific judge of the district court and the options available to the judge and the government after the motion is properly filed.

I21The long-standing majority practice in assigning motions made pursuant to ÿ1A2255 has been for the trial judge to determine the merits of the motion. In cases where the ÿ1A2255 motion is directed against the sentence, the merits have traditionally been decided by the judge who imposed sentence. The reasoning for this was first noted in T3Currell v. United StatesK, 173 F.2d 348, 348ÿ09349 (4th Cir. 1949):

I22Complaint is made that the judge who tried the case passed upon the motion. Not only was there no impropriety in this, but it is highly desirable in such cases that the motions be passed on by the judge who is familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding the trial, and is consequently not likely to be misled by false allegations as to what occurred.

I33This case, and its reasoning, has been almost unanimously endorsed by other courts dealing with the issue.

I21Commentators have been critical of having the motion decided by the trial judge. See Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1206ÿ091208 (1970).

I31[T]he trial judge may have become so involved with the decision that it will be difficult for him to review it objectively. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that ``court'' refers to a specific judge, and the procedural advantages of section 2255 are available whether or not the trial judge presides at the hearing.

I22The theory that Congress intended the trial judge to preside at a section 2255 hearing apparently originated in T3Carvell v. United StatesK, 173 F.2d 348 (4th Cir. 1949) (per curiam), where the panel of judges included Chief Judge Parker of the Fourth Circuit, chairman of the Judicial Conference committee which drafted section 2255. But the legislative history does not indicate that Congress wanted the trial judge to preside. Indeed the advantages of section 2255 can all be achieved if the case is heard in the sentencing district, regardless of which judge hears it. According to the Senate committee report the purpose of the bill was to make the proceeding a part of the criminal action so the court could resentence the applicant, or grant him a new trial. (A judge presiding over a habeas corpus action does not have these powers.) In addition, Congress did not want the cases heard in the district of confinement because that tended to concentrate the burden on a few districts, and made it difficult for witnesses and records to be produced.

I7183 Harv.L.Rev. at 1207ÿ091208

I21The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held that a judge other than the trial judge should rule on the 2255 motion. See T3Halliday v. United StatesK, 380 F.2d 270 (1st Cir. 1967).

I21There is a procedure by which the movant can have a judge other than the trial judge decide his motion in courts adhering to the majority rule. He can file an affidavit alleging bias in order to disqualify the trial judge. And there are circumstances in which the trial judge will, on his own, disqualify himself. See, T3e.g., Webster v. United StatesK, 330 F.Supp. 1080 (1972). However, there has been some questioning of the effectiveness of this procedure. See Developments in the Law_Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1200ÿ091207 (1970).

I21Subdivision (a) adopts the majority rule and provides that the trial judge, or sentencing judge if different and appropriate for the particular motion, will decide the motion made pursuant to these rules, recognizing that, under some circumstances, he may want to disqualify himself. A movant is not without remedy if he feels this is unfair to him. He can file an affidavit of bias. And there is the right to appellate review if the trial judge refuses to grant his motion. Because the trial judge is thoroughly familiar with the case, there is obvious administrative advantage in giving him the first opportunity to decide whether there are grounds for granting the motion.

I21Since the motion is part of the criminal action in which was entered the judgment to which it is directed, the files, records, transcripts, and correspondence relating to that judgment are automatically available to the judge in his consideration of the motion. He no longer need order them incorporated for that purpose.

I21Rule 4 has its basis in ÿ1A2255 (rather than 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243 in the corresponding habeas corpus rule) which does not have a specific time limitation as to when the answer must be made. Also, under ÿ1A2255, the United States Attorney for the district is the party served with the notice and a copy of the motion and required to answer (when appropriate). Subdivision (b) continues this practice since there is no respondent involved in the motion (unlike habeas) and the United States Attorney, as prosecutor in the case in question, is the most appropriate one to defend the judgment and oppose the motion.

I21The judge has discretion to require an answer or other appropriate response from the United States Attorney. See advisory committee note to rule 4 of the ÿ1A2254 rules.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 4 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21The amended rule reflects that the response to a Section 2255 motion may be a motion to dismiss or some other response.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee modified Rule 4 to reflect the view of some commentators that it is common practice in some districts for the government to file a pre-answer motion to dismiss the ÿ1A2255 motion. The Committee agreed with that recommendation and changed the word ``pleading'' in the rule to ``response.'' It also made several minor changes to the Committee Note.

I81Rule 5. The Answer and the Reply

I11(a) T4When RequiredK. The respondent is not required to answer the motion unless a judge so orders.

I11(b) T4ContentsK. The answer must address the allegations in the motion. In addition, it must state whether the moving party has used any other federal remedies, including any prior post-conviction motions under these rules or any previous rules, and whether the moving party received an evidentiary hearing.

I11(c) T4Records of Prior ProceedingsK. If the answer refers to briefs or transcripts of the prior proceedings that are not available in the court's records, the judge must order the government to furnish them within a reasonable time that will not unduly delay the proceedings.

I11(d) T4ReplyK. The moving party may submit a reply to the respondent's answer or other pleading within a time fixed by the judge.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Unlike the habeas corpus statutes (see 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2243, 2248) ÿ1A2255 does not specifically call for a return or answer by the United States Attorney or set any time limits as to when one must be submitted. The general practice, however, if the motion is not summarily dismissed, is for the government to file an answer to the motion as well as counter-affidavits, when appropriate. Rule 4 provides for an answer to the motion by the United States Attorney, and rule 5 indicates what its contents should be.

I21There is no requirement that the movant exhaust his remedies prior to seeking relief under ÿ1A2255. However, the courts have held that such a motion is inappropriate if the movant is simultaneously appealing the decision.

I22We are of the view that there is no jurisdictional bar to the District Court's entertaining a Section 2255 motion during the pendency of a direct appeal but that the orderly administration of criminal law precludes considering such a motion absent extraordinary circumstances.

I71T3Womack v. United StatesK, 395 F.2d 630, 631 (D.C.Cir. 1968)

I33Also see T3Masters v. EideK, 353 F.2d 517 (8th Cir. 1965). The answer may thus cut short consideration of the motion if it discloses the taking of an appeal which was omitted from the form motion filed by the movant.

I21There is nothing in ÿ1A2255 which corresponds to the ÿ1A2248 requirement of a traverse to the answer. Numerous cases have held that the government's answer and affidavits are not conclusive against the movant, and if they raise disputed issues of fact a hearing must be held. T3Machibroda v. United StatesK, 368 U.S. 487, 494, 495 (1962); T3United States v. SalernoK, 290 F.2d 105, 106 (2d Cir. 1961); T3Romero v. United StatesK, 327 F.2d 711, 712 (5th Cir. 1964); T3Scott v. United StatesK, 349 F.2d 641, 642, 643 (6th Cir. 1965); T3Schiebelhut v. United StatesK, 357 F.2d 743, 745 (6th Cir. 1966); and T3Del Piano v. United StatesK, 362 F.2d 931, 932, 933 (3d Cir. 1966). None of these cases make any mention of a traverse by the movant to the government's answer. As under rule 5 of the ÿ1A2254 rules, there is no intention here that such a traverse be required, except under special circumstances. See advisory committee note to rule 9.

I21Subdivision (b) provides for the government to supplement its answers with appropriate copies of transcripts or briefs if for some reason the judge does not already have them under his control. This is because the government will in all probability have easier access to such papers than the movant, and it will conserve the court's time to have the government produce them rather than the movant, who would in most instances have to apply in forma pauperis for the government to supply them for him anyway.

I21For further discussion, see the advisory committee note to rule 5 of the ÿ1A2254 rules.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21Revised Rule 5(a), which provides that the respondent is not required to file an answer to the motion, unless a judge so orders, is taken from current Rule 3(b). The revised rule does not address the practice in some districts, where the respondent files a pre-answer motion to dismiss the motion. But revised Rule 4(b) contemplates that practice and has been changed to reflect the view that if the court does not dismiss the motion, it may require (or permit) the respondent to file a motion.

I21Finally, revised Rule 5(d) adopts the practice in some jurisdictions giving the movant an opportunity to file a reply to the respondent's answer. Rather than using terms such as ``traverse,'' T3seeK 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2248, to identify the movant's response to the answer, the rule uses the more general term ``reply.'' The Rule prescribes that the court set the time for such responses, and in lieu of setting specific time limits in each case, the court may decide to include such time limits in its local rules.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. Rule 5(a) was modified to read that the government is not required to ``respond'' to the motion unless the court so orders; the term ``respond'' was used because it leaves open the possibility that the government's first response (as it is in some districts) is in the form of a pre-answer motion to dismiss the petition. The Note has been changed to reflect the fact that although the rule itself does not reflect that particular motion, it is used in some districts and refers the reader to Rule 4.

I21Finally, the Committee changed the Note to address the use of the term ``traverse,'' a point raised by one of the commentators on the proposed rule.

I81Rule 6. Discovery

I11(a) T4Leave of Court RequiredK. A judge may, for good cause, authorize a party to conduct discovery under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or Civil Procedure, or in accordance with the practices and principles of law. If necessary for effective discovery, the judge must appoint an attorney for a moving party who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A.

I11(b) T4Requesting DiscoveryK. A party requesting discovery must provide reasons for the request. The request must also include any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents.

I11(c) T4Deposition ExpensesK. If the government is granted leave to take a deposition, the judge may require the government to pay the travel expenses, subsistence expenses, and fees of the moving party's attorney to attend the deposition.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21This rule differs from the corresponding discovery rule under the ÿ1A2254 rules in that it includes the processes of discovery available under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as well as the civil. This is because of the nature of a ÿ1A2255 motion as a continuing part of the criminal proceeding (see advisory committee note to rule 1) as well as a remedy analogous to habeas corpus by state prisoners.

I21See the advisory committee note to rule 6 of the ÿ1A2254 rules. The discussion there is fully applicable to discovery under these rules for ÿ1A2255 motions.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 6 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as indicated below.

I21Although current Rule 6(b) contains no requirement that the parties provide reasons for the requested discovery, the revised rule does so and also includes a requirement that the request be accompanied by any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents. The Committee believes that the revised rule makes explicit what has been implicit in current practice.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee modified Rule 6(b), to require that discovery requests be supported by reasons, to assist the court in deciding what, if any, discovery should take place. The Committee amended the Note to reflect the view that it believed that the change made explicit what has been implicit in current practice.

I81Rule 7. Expanding the Record

I11(a) T4In GeneralK. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge may direct the parties to expand the record by submitting additional materials relating to the motion. The judge may require that these materials be authenticated.

I11(b) T4Types of MaterialsK. The materials that may be required include letters predating the filing of the motion, documents, exhibits, and answers under oath to written interrogatories propounded by the judge. Affidavits also may be submitted and considered as part of the record.

I11(c) T4Review by the Opposing PartyK. The judge must give the party against whom the additional materials are offered an opportunity to admit or deny their correctness.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21It is less likely that the court will feel the need to expand the record in a ÿ1A2255 proceeding than in a habeas corpus proceeding, because the trial (or sentencing) judge is the one hearing the motion (see rule 4) and should already have a complete file on the case in his possession. However, rule 7 provides a convenient method for supplementing his file if the case warrants it.

I21See the advisory committee note to rule 7 of the ÿ1A2254 rules for a full discussion of reasons and procedures for expanding the record.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 7 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21Revised Rule 7(a) is not intended to restrict the court's authority to expand the record through means other than requiring the parties themselves to provide the information.

I21The language in current Rule 7(d), which deals with authentication of materials in the expanded record, has been moved to revised Rule 7(a).

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. Rule 7(a) was changed by removing the reference to the ``merits'' of the motion. One commentator had stated that the court may wish to expand the record for purposes other than the merits of the case. The Committee agreed and also changed the rule to reflect that someone other than a party may authenticate the materials.

I81Rule 8. Evidentiary Hearing

I11(a) T4Determining Whether to Hold a HearingK. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge must review the answer, any transcripts and records of prior proceedings, and any materials submitted under Rule 7 to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted.

I11(b) T4Reference to a Magistrate JudgeK. A judge may, under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A636(b), refer the motion to a magistrate judge to conduct hearings and to file proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition. When they are filed, the clerk must promptly serve copies of the proposed findings and recommendations on all parties. Within 14 days after being served, a party may file objections as provided by local court rule. The judge must determine de novo any proposed finding or recommendation to which objection is made. The judge may accept, reject, or modify any proposed finding or recommendation.

I11(c) T4Appointing Counsel; Time of HearingK. If an evidentiary hearing is warranted, the judge must appoint an attorney to represent a moving party who qualifies to have counsel appointed under 18 U.S.C. ÿ1A3006A. The judge must conduct the hearing as soon as practicable after giving the attorneys adequate time to investigate and prepare. These rules do not limit the appointment of counsel under ÿ1A3006A at any stage of the proceeding.

I11(d) T4Producing a StatementK. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2(a)ÿ09(d) and (f) applies at a hearing under this rule. If a party does not comply with a Rule 26.2(a) order to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.

I53(As amended Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(6), Sept. 28, 1976, 90 Stat. 1335; Pub. L. 94ÿ09577, ÿ1A2(a)(2), (b)(2), Oct. 21, 1976, 90 Stat. 2730, 2731; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21The standards for ÿ1A2255 hearings are essentially the same as for evidentiary hearings under a habeas petition, except that the previous federal fact-finding proceeding is in issue rather than the state's. Also ÿ1A2255 does not set specific time limits for holding the hearing, as does ÿ1A2243 for a habeas action. With these minor differences in mind, see the advisory committee note to rule 8 of ÿ1A2254 rules, which is applicable to rule 8 of these ÿ1A2255 rules.

I711993 T4Amendment

I21The amendment to Rule 8 is one of a series of parallel amendments to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 32, 32.1, and 46 which extend the scope of Rule 26.2 (Production of Witness Statements) to proceedings other than the trial itself. The amendments are grounded on the compelling need for accurate and credible information in making decisions concerning the defendant's liberty. T3SeeK the Advisory Committee Note to Rule 26.2(g). A few courts have recognized the authority of a judicial officer to order production of prior statements by a witness at a Section 2255 hearing, T3see, e.g., United States v. WhiteK, 342 F.2d 379, 382, n.4 (4th Cir. 1959). The amendment to Rule 8 grants explicit authority to do so. The amendment is not intended to require production of a witness's statement before the witness actually presents oral testimony.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 8 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.

I21The requirement in current Rule 8(b)(2) that a copy of the magistrate judge's findings must be promptly mailed to all parties has been changed in revised Rule 8(b) to require that copies of those findings be served on all parties. As used in this rule, ``service'' means service consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b), which allows mailing the copies.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee made no changes to Rule 8, as published for public comment.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12009K Amendment

I74Amendments by Public Law

I211976_Subd. (b). Pub. L. 94ÿ09577, ÿ1A2(a)(2), substituted provisions which authorized magistrates, when designated to do so in accordance with section 636(b) of this title, to conduct hearings, including evidentiary hearings, on the petition and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition, which directed the magistrate to file proposed findings and recommendations with the court with copies furnished to all parties, which allowed parties thus served 10 days to file written objections thereto, and which directed a judge of the court to make de novo determinations of the objected-to portions and to accept, reject, or modify the findings or recommendations for provisions under which the magistrate had been empowered only to recommend to the district judge that an evidentiary hearing be held or that the petition be dismissed.

I21Subd. (c). Pub. L. 94ÿ09577, ÿ1A2(b)(2), substituted ``and the hearing shall be conducted'' for ``and shall conduct the hearing.''

I81Rule 9. Second or Successive Motions

I11Before presenting a second or successive motion, the moving party must obtain an order from the appropriate court of appeals authorizing the district court to consider the motion, as required by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255, para. 8.

I53(As amended Pub. L. 94ÿ09426, ÿ1A2(9), (10), Sept. 28, 1976, 90 Stat. 1335; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Unlike the statutory provisions on habeas corpus (28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2241ÿ092254), ÿ1A2255 specifically provides that ``a motion for such relief may be made T3at any time.''K [Emphasis added.] Subdivision (a) provides that delayed motions may be barred from consideration if the government has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the motion by the delay and the movant's failure to seek relief earlier is not excusable within the terms of the rule. Case law, dealing with this issue, is in conflict.

I21Some courts have held that the literal language of ÿ1A2255 precludes any possible time bar to a motion brought under it. In T3Heflin v. United StatesK, 358 U.S. 415 (1959), the concurring opinion noted:

I31The statute [28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255] further provides; ``A motion *** may be made at any time.'' This *** simply means that, as in habeas corpus, there is no statute of limitations, no T3res judicataK, and that the doctrine of laches is inapplicable.

I71358 U.S. at 420

I33T3McKinney v. United StatesK, 208 F.2d 844 (D.C.Cir. 1953) reversed the district court's dismissal of a ÿ1A2255 motion for being too late, the court stating:

I22McKinney's present application for relief comes late in the day: he has served some fifteen years in prison. But tardiness is irrelevant where a constitutional issue is raised and where the prisoner is still confined.

I71208 F.2d at 846, 847

I33In accord, see: T3Juelich v. United StatesK, 300 F.2d 381, 383 (5th Cir. 1962); T3Conners v. United StatesK, 431 F.2d 1207, 1208 (9th Cir. 1970); T3Sturrup v. United StatesK, 218 F.Supp. 279, 281 (E.D.N.Car. 1963); and T3Banks v. United StatesK, 319 F.Supp. 649, 652 (S.D.N.Y. 1970).

I21It has also been held that delay in filing a ÿ1A2255 motion does not bar the movant because of lack of reasonable diligence in pressing the claim.

I31The statute [28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255], when it states that the motion may be made at any time, excludes the addition of a showing of diligence in delayed filings. A number of courts have considered contentions similar to those made here and have concluded that there are no time limitations. This result excludes the requirement of diligence which is in reality a time limitation.

I71T3Haier v. United StatesK, 334 F.2d 441, 442 (10th Cir. 1964)

I21Other courts have recognized that delay may have a negative effect on the movant. In T3Raines v. United StatesK, 423 F.2d 526 (4th Cir. 1970), the court stated:

I31[B]oth petitioners' silence for extended periods, one for 28 months and the other for nine years, serves to render their allegations less believable. ``Although a delay in filing a section 2255 motion is not a controlling element *** it may merit some consideration ***.''

I71423 F.2d at 531

I21In T3Aiken v. United StatesK, 191 F.Supp. 43, 50 (M.D.N.Car. 1961), aff'd 296 F.2d 604 (4th Cir. 1961), the court said: ``While motions under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255 may be made at any time, the lapse of time affects the good faith and credibility of the moving party.'' For similar conclusions, see: T3Parker v. United StatesK, 358 F.2d 50, 54 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 916 (1967); T3Le Clair v. United StatesK, 241 F.Supp. 819, 824 (N.D. Ind. 1965); T3Malone v. United StatesK, 299 F.2d 254, 256 (6th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 863 (1962); T3Howell v. United StatesK, 442 F.2d 265, 274 (7th Cir. 1971); and T3United States v. WigginsK, 184 F. Supp. 673, 676 (D.C.Cir. 1960).

I21There have been holdings by some courts that a delay in filing a ÿ1A2255 motion operates to increase the burden of proof which the movant must meet to obtain relief. The reasons for this, as expressed in T3United States v. BosticK, 206 F.Supp. 855 (D.C.Cir. 1962), are equitable in nature.

I22Obviously, the burden of proof on a motion to vacate a sentence under 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255 is on the moving party. ... The burden is particularly heavy if the issue is one of fact and a long time has elapsed since the trial of the case. While neither the statute of limitations nor laches can bar the assertion of a constitutional right, nevertheless, the passage of time may make it impracticable to retry a case if the motion is granted and a new trial is ordered. No doubt, at times such a motion is a product of an afterthought. Long delay may raise a question of good faith.

I71206 F.Supp. at 856ÿ09857

I33See also T3United States v. WigginsK, 184 F.Supp. at 676.

I21A requirement that the movant display reasonable diligence in filing a ÿ1A2255 motion has been adopted by some courts dealing with delayed motions. The court in T3United States v. MooreK, 166 F.2d 102 (7th Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 334 U.S. 849 (1948), did this, again for equitable reasons.

I22[W]e agree with the District Court that the petitioner has too long slept upon his rights. *** [A]pparently there is no limitation of time within which *** a motion to vacate may be filed, except that an applicant must show reasonable diligence in presenting his claim. ***

I22The reasons which support the rule requiring diligence seem obvious. *** Law enforcement officials change, witnesses die, memories grow dim. The prosecuting tribunal is put to a disadvantage if an unexpected retrial should be necessary after long passage of time.

I71166 F.2d at 105

I33In accord see T3Desmond v. United StatesK, 333 F.2d 378, 381 (1st Cir. 1964), on remand, 345 F.2d 225 (1st Cir. 1965).

I21One of the major arguments advanced by the courts which would penalize a movant who waits an unduly long time before filing a ÿ1A2255 motion is that such delay is highly prejudicial to the prosecution. In T3Desmond v. United StatesK, writing of a ÿ1A2255 motion alleging denial of effective appeal because of deception by movant's own counsel, the court said:

I31[A]pplications for relief such as this must be made promptly. It will not do for a prisoner to wait until government witnesses have become unavailable as by death, serious illness or absence from the country, or until the memory of available government witnesses has faded. It will not even do for a prisoner to wait any longer than is reasonably necessary to prepare appropriate moving papers, however inartistic, after discovery of the deception practiced upon him by his attorney.

I71333 F.2d at 381

I33In a similar vein are T3United States v. MooreK and T3United States v. BosticK, supra, and T3United States v. WigginsK, 184 F. Supp. at 676.

I21Subdivision (a) provides a flexible, equitable time limitation based on laches to prevent movants from withholding their claims so as to prejudice the government both in meeting the allegations of the motion and in any possible retrial. It includes a reasonable diligence requirement for ascertaining possible grounds for relief. If the delay is found to be excusable, or nonprejudicial to the government, the time bar is inoperative.

I21Subdivision (b) is consistent with the language of ÿ1A2255 and relevant case law.

I21The annexed form is intended to serve the same purpose as the comparable one included in the ÿ1A2254 rules.

I21For further discussion applicable to this rule, see the advisory committee note to rule 9 of the ÿ1A2254 rules.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 9 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as indicated below.

I21First, current Rule 9(a) has been deleted as unnecessary in light of the applicable one-year statute of limitations for ÿ1A2255 motions, added as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255, para. 6.

I21Second, the remainder of revised Rule 9 reflects provisions in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255, parh. [sic] 8, which now require a moving party to obtain approval from the appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive motion.

I21Finally, the title of the rule has been changed to reflect the fact that the revised version addresses only the topic of second or successive motions.

I81Rule 11. Certificate of Appealability; Time to Appeal

I11(a) T4Certificate of AppealabilityK. The district court must issue or deny a certificate of appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the applicant. Before entering the final order, the court may direct the parties to submit arguments on whether a certificate should issue. If the court issues a certificate, the court must state the specific issue or issues that satisfy the showing required by 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2253(c)(2). If the court denies a certificate, a party may not appeal the denial but may seek a certificate from the court of appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22. A motion to reconsider a denial does not extend the time to appeal.

I11(b) T4Time to AppealK. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) governs the time to appeal an order entered under these rules. A timely notice of appeal must be filed even if the district court issues a certificate of appealability. These rules do not extend the time to appeal the original judgment of conviction.

I53(As amended Apr. 30, 1979, eff. Aug. 1, 1979; Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21Rule 11 is intended to make clear that, although a ÿ1A2255 action is a continuation of the criminal case, the bringing of a ÿ1A2255 action does not extend the time.

I711979 T4Amendment

I21Prior to the promulgation of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, the courts consistently held that the time for appeal in a section 2255 case is as provided in Fed.R.App.P. 4(a), that is, 60 days when the government is a party, rather than as provided in appellate rule 4(b), which says that the time is 10 days in criminal cases. This result has often been explained on the ground that rule 4(a) has to do with civil cases and that ``proceedings under section 2255 are civil in nature.'' E.g., T3Rothman v. United StatesK, 508 F.2d 648 (3d Cir. 1975). Because the new section 2255 rules are based upon the premise ``that a motion under ÿ1A2255 is a further step in the movant's criminal case rather than a separate civil action,'' see Advisory Committee Note to rule 1, the question has arisen whether the new rules have the effect of shortening the time for appeal to that provided in appellate rule 4(b). A sentence has been added to rule 11 in order to make it clear that this is not the case.

I21Even though section 2255 proceedings are a further step in the criminal case, the added sentence correctly states current law. In T3United States v. HaymanK, 342 U.S. 205 (1952), the Supreme Court noted that such appeals ``are governed by the civil rules applicable to appeals from final judgments in habeas corpus actions.'' In support, the Court cited T3Mercado v. United StatesK, 183 F.2d 486 (1st Cir. 1950), a case rejecting the argument that because ÿ1A2255 proceedings are criminal in nature the time for appeal is only 10 days. The T3MercadoK court concluded that the situation was governed by that part of 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2255 which reads: ``An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.'' Thus, because appellate rule 4(a) is applicable in habeas cases, it likewise governs in ÿ1A2255 cases even though they are criminal in nature.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12004K Amendment

I21The language of Rule 11 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.

I21T3Changes Made After Publication and CommentsK. The Committee made no changes to Rule 11, as published.

I74Committee Notes on Rules_T12009K Amendment

I21T3Subdivision (a)K. As provided in 28 U.S.C. ÿ1A2253(c), an applicant may not appeal to the court of appeals from a final order in a proceeding under ÿ1A2255 unless a judge issues a COA, identifying the specific issues for which the applicant has made a substantial showing of a denial of constitutional right. New Rule 11(a) makes the requirements concerning certificates of appealability more prominent by adding and consolidating them in the appropriate rule of the Rules Governing ÿ1A2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts. Rule 11(a) also requires the district judge to grant or deny the certificate at the time a final order is issued. T3SeeK 3d Cir. R. 22.2, 111.3. This will ensure prompt decision making when the issues are fresh, rather than postponing consideration of the certificate until after a notice of appeal is filed. These changes will expedite proceedings, avoid unnecessary remands, and help to inform the applicant's decision whether to file a notice of appeal.

I21T3Subdivision (b)K. The amendment is designed to make it clear that the district court's grant of a COA does not eliminate the need to file a notice of appeal.

I21T3Changes Made to Proposed Amendment Released for Public CommentK. In response to public comments, a sentence was added stating that prior to the entry of the final order the district court may direct the parties to submit arguments on whether or not a certificate should issue. This allows a court in complex cases (such as death penalty cases with numerous claims) to solicit briefing that might narrow the issues for appeal. For purposes of clarification, two sentences were added at the end of subdivision (a) stating that (1) although the district court's denial of a certificate is not appealable, a certificate may be sought in the court of appeals, and (2) a motion for reconsideration of a denial of a certificate does not extend the time to appeal. Finally, a sentence indicating that notice of appeal must be filed even if a COA is issued was added to subdivision (b).

I21Minor changes were also made to conform to style conventions.

I81Rule 12. Applicability of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

I11The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with any statutory provisions or these rules, may be applied to a proceeding under these rules.

I53(As amended Apr. 26, 2004, eff. Dec. 1, 2004.)

I74Advisory Committee Note

I21This rule differs from rule 11 of the ÿ1A2254 rules in that it includes the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as well as the civil. This is because of the nature of a ÿ1A2255 motion as a continuing part of the criminal proceeding (see advisory committee note to rule 1) as well as a remedy analogous to habeas corpus by state prisoners.

I21Since ÿ1A2255 has been considered analogous to habeas as respects the restrictions in Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(2) (see T3Sullivan v. United StatesK, 198 F.Supp. 624 (S.D.N.Y. 1961)), rule 12 is needed. For discussion, see the advisory committee note to rule 11 of the ÿ1A2254 rules.

I12(3) a State prisoner files a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 within the time required by section 2263 and fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of a Federal right or is denied relief in the district court or at any subsequent stage of review.

I11(a) Whenever a State prisoner under capital sentence files a petition for habeas corpus relief to which this chapter applies, the district court shall only consider a claim or claims that have been raised and decided on the merits in the State courts, unless the failure to raise the claim properly is_

I12(1) the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States;

I12(2) the result of the Supreme Court's recognition of a new Federal right that is made retroactively applicable; or

I12(3) based on a factual predicate that could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review.

I11(ii) The factors, among others, that a court shall consider in determining whether a delay in the disposition of an application is warranted are as follows:

I12(I) Whether the failure to allow the delay would be likely to result in a miscarriage of justice.

I89. Stay of State court proceedings

I11A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.

I53(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 968.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., ÿ1A379 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, ÿ1A265, 36 Stat. 1162).

I21An exception as to acts of Congress relating to bankruptcy was omitted and the general exception substituted to cover all exceptions.

I21The phrase ``in aid of its jurisdiction'' was added to conform to section 1651 of this title and to make clear the recognized power of the Federal courts to stay proceedings in State cases removed to the district courts.

I21The exceptions specifically include the words ``to protect or ``effectuate its judgments,'' for lack of which the Supreme Court held that the Federal courts are without power to enjoin relitigation of cases and controversies fully adjudicated by such courts. (See T3Toucey v. New York Life Insurance CoK., 62 S.Ct. 139, 314 U.S. 118, 86 L.Ed. 100. A vigorous dissenting opinion (62 S.Ct. 148) notes that at the time of the 1911 revision of the Judicial Code, the power of the courts, of the United States to protect their judgments was unquestioned and that the revisers of that code noted no change and Congress intended no change).

I21Therefore the revised section restores the basic law as generally understood and interpreted prior to the Toucey decision.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I80ÿ1A2284

I89. Three-judge court; when required; composition; procedure

I11(a) A district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.

I11(b) In any action required to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges under subsection (a) of this section, the composition and procedure of the court shall be as follows:

I11(1) Upon the filing of a request for three judges, the judge to whom the request is presented shall, unless he determines that three judges are not required, immediately notify the chief judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other judges, at least one of whom shall be a circuit judge. The judges so designated, and the judge to whom the request was presented, shall serve as members of the court to hear and determine the action or proceeding.

I11(2) If the action is against a State, or officer or agency thereof, at least five days' notice of hearing of the action shall be given by registered or certified mail to the Governor and attorney general of the State.

I11(3) A single judge may conduct all proceedings except the trial, and enter all orders permitted by the rules of civil procedure except as provided in this subsection. He may grant a temporary restraining order on a specific finding, based on evidence submitted, that specified irreparable damage will result if the order is not granted, which order, unless previously revoked by the district judge, shall remain in force only until the hearing and determination by the district court of three judges of an application for a preliminary injunction. A single judge shall not appoint a master, or order a reference, or hear and determine any application for a preliminary or permanent injunction or motion to vacate such an injunction, or enter judgment on the merits. Any action of a single judge may be reviewed by the full court at any time before final judgment.

I21Provisions of sections 47, 47a, 380, and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction of direct appeals appear in section 1253 of this title.

I21Provisions of sections 47, 380, and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., requiring applications for injunctions restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of Federal or State statutes or orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission to be heard and determined by three-judge district courts appear in sections 2281, 2282, and 2325 of this title.

I21The provision for notice to the United States attorney for the district where the action is pending was added because of the necessity of the United States attorney's preparation for hearing as soon as possible, to expedite such a case.

I21Provisions of sections 47, 47a, 380, and 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., respecting time for direct appeal appear in section 2101 of this title.

I21This revised section represents an effort to provide a uniform method of convoking three-judge district courts, and for procedure therein. It follows recommendations of a committee appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, composed of Circuit Judges Evan A. Evans, Kimbrough Stone, Orie L. Phillips, and Albert B. Maris.

I21The committee pointed out that section 380a of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., is the latest and ``most carefully drawn expression by Congress on the subject.'' Consequently, this section follows closely such section 380a and eliminates the discrepancies between sections 47, 47a, 380, and 380a of such title.

I21This section governs only the composition and procedure of three-judge district courts. The requirement that applications for injunctions be heard and determined by such courts will appear in other sections of this and other titles of the United States Code as Congress may enact from time to time. For example, see sections 2281, 2282, and 2325 of this title, sections 1213, 1215, 1255 of title 11, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Bankruptcy, section 28 of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade, and section 44 of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation.

I21United States District Judge W. Calvin Chestnut, has referred to the provisions relating to enforcement or setting aside or orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission as unfortunately lengthy and prolix. He has urged revision to insure uniform procedure in the several classes of so-called three-judge cases.

I21The provision that such notice shall be given by the clerk by registered mail, and shall be complete on the mailing thereof follows, substantially, rules 4(d)(4) and 5(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

I21Changes were made in phraseology.

I11(b) When the agency has not held a hearing before taking the action of which review is sought by the petition, the court of appeals shall determine whether a hearing is required by law. After that determination, the court shall_

I12(1) remand the proceedings to the agency to hold a hearing, when a hearing is required by law;

I12(2) pass on the issues presented, when a hearing is not required by law and it appears from the pleadings and affidavits filed by the parties that no genuine issue of material fact is presented; or

I12(3) transfer the proceedings to a district court for the district in which the petitioner resides or has its principal office for a hearing and determination as if the proceedings were originally initiated in the district court, when a hearing is not required by law and a genuine issue of material fact is presented.

I12(2) there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence before the agency;

Q04

I10the court may order the additional evidence and any counterevidence the opposite party desires to offer to be taken by the agency. The agency may modify its findings of fact, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and may modify or set aside its order, and shall file in the court the additional evidence, the modified findings or new findings, and the modified order or the order setting aside the original order.

The court of appeals in which the record on review is filed, on the filing, has jurisdiction to vacate stay orders or interlocutory injunctions previously granted by any court, and has exclusive jurisdiction to make and enter, on the petition, evidence, and proceedings set forth in the record on review, a judgment determining the validity of, and enjoining, setting aside, or suspending, in whole or in part, the order of the agency.

When the petitioner makes application for an interlocutory injunction restraining or suspending the enforcement, operation, or execution of, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any order reviewable under this chapter, at least 5 days' notice of the hearing thereon shall be given to the agency and to the Attorney General. In a case in which irreparable damage would otherwise result to the petitioner, the court of appeals may, on hearing, after reasonable notice to the agency and to the Attorney General, order a temporary stay or suspension, in whole or in part, of the operation of the order of the agency for not more than 60 days from the date of the order pending the hearing on the application for the interlocutory injunction, in which case the order of the court of appeals shall contain a specific finding, based on evidence submitted to the court of appeals, and identified by reference thereto, that irreparable damage would result to the petitioner and specifying the nature of the damage. The court of appeals, at the time of hearing the application for an interlocutory injunction, on a like finding, may continue the temporary stay or suspension, in whole or in part, until decision on the application.

The case of T3U.S. v. HeardK, D.C.Va. 1940, 32 F.Supp. 39, reviews the conflicting decisions on the question whether compliance with the section must be pleaded, and offers persuasive argument that it need not be, and that the section was designed as a rule of evidence. The wording of the remainder of the section also supports this conclusion, as pointed out by Judge Learned Hand in T3U.S. v.

Upon cessation of such use or requirement, the State may dispute title to such lands pursuant to the provisions of this section.

I11(a) Under the conditions prescribed in this section and section 1444 of this title for the protection of the United States, the United States may be named a party in any civil action or suit in any district court, or in any State court having jurisdiction of the subject matter_

Q04

I10real or personal property on which the United States has or claims a mortgage or other lien.

I11(b) The complaint or pleading shall set forth with particularity the nature of the interest or lien of the United States. In actions or suits involving liens arising under the internal revenue laws, the complaint or pleading shall include the name and address of the taxpayer whose liability created the lien and, if a notice of the tax lien was filed, the identity of the internal revenue office which filed the notice, and the date and place such notice of lien was filed. In actions in the State courts service upon the United States shall be made by serving the process of the court with a copy of the complaint upon the United States attorney for the district in which the action is brought or upon an assistant United States attorney or clerical employee designated by the United States attorney in writing filed with the clerk of the court in which the action is brought and by sending copies of the process and complaint, by registered mail, or by certified mail, to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, District of Columbia. In such actions the United States may appear and answer, plead or demur within sixty days after such service or such further time as the court may allow.

I11(c) A judgment or decree in such action or suit shall have the same effect respecting the discharge of the property from the mortgage or other lien held by the United States as may be provided with respect to such matters by the local law of the place where the court is situated. However, an action to foreclose a mortgage or other lien, naming the United States as a party under this section, must seek judicial sale. A sale to satisfy a lien inferior to one of the United States shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien of the United States, unless the United States consents that the property may be sold free of its lien and the proceeds divided as the parties may be entitled. Where a sale of real estate is made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States, the United States shall have one year from the date of sale within which to redeem, except that with respect to a lien arising under the internal revenue laws the period shall be 120 days or the period allowable for redemption under State law, whichever is longer, and in any case in which, under the provisions of section 505 of the Housing Act of 1950, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1701k), and subsection (d) of section 3720 of title 38 of the United States Code, the right to redeem does not arise, there shall be no right of redemption. In any case where the debt owing the United States is due, the United States may ask, by way of affirmative relief, for the foreclosure of its own lien and where property is sold to satisfy a first lien held by the United States, the United States may bid at the sale such sum, not exceeding the amount of its claim with expenses of sale, as may be directed by the head (or his delegate) of the department or agency of the United States which has charge of the administration of the laws in respect to which the claim of the United States arises. In any case where the United States is a bidder at the judicial sale, it may credit the amount determined to be due it against the amount it bids at such sales.

I11(d) In any case in which the United States redeems real property under this section or section 7425 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the amount to be paid for such property shall be the sum of_

I12(1) the actual amount paid by the purchaser at such sale (which, in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent satisfied by reason of such sale),

I12(2) interest on the amount paid (as determined under paragraph (1)) at 6 percent per annum from the date of such sale, and

I12(3) the amount (if any) equal to the excess of (A) the expenses necessarily incurred in connection with such property, over (B) the income from such property plus (to the extent such property is used by the purchaser) a reasonable rental value of such property.

Q04

I11(e) Whenever any person has a lien upon any real or personal property, duly recorded in the jurisdiction in which the property is located, and a junior lien, other than a tax lien, in favor of the United States attaches to such property, such person may make a written request to the officer charged with the administration of the laws in respect of which the lien of the United States arises, to have the same extinguished. If after appropriate investigation, it appears to such officer that the proceeds from the sale of the property would be insufficient to wholly or partly satisfy the lien of the United States, or that the claim of the United States has been satisfied or by lapse of time or otherwise has become unenforceable, such officer may issue a certificate releasing the property from such lien.

I89. Costs and fees

I11(a)(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a judgment for costs, as enumerated in section 1920 of this title, but not including the fees and expenses of attorneys, may be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action. A judgment for costs when taxed against the United States shall, in an amount established by statute, court rule, or order, be limited to reimbursing in whole or in part the prevailing party for the costs incurred by such party in the litigation.

I11(2) A judgment for costs, when awarded in favor of the United States in an action brought by the United States, may include an amount equal to the filing fee prescribed under section 1914(a) of this title. The preceding sentence shall not be construed as requiring the United States to pay any filing fee.

I11(b) Unless expressly prohibited by statute, a court may award reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, in addition to the costs which may be awarded pursuant to subsection (a), to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction of such action. The United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.

I11(c)(1) Any judgment against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity for costs pursuant to subsection (a) shall be paid as provided in sections 2414 and 2517 of this title and shall be in addition to any relief provided in the judgment.

I11(2) Any judgment against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity for fees and expenses of attorneys pursuant to subsection (b) shall be paid as provided in sections 2414 and 2517 of this title, except that if the basis for the award is a finding that the United States acted in bad faith, then the award shall be paid by any agency found to have acted in bad faith and shall be in addition to any relief provided in the judgment.

I11(d)(1)(A) Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.

I11(B) A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection, and the amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed. The party shall also allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified. Whether or not the position of the United States was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record (including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based) which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought.

I11(C) The court, in its discretion, may reduce the amount to be awarded pursuant to this subsection, or deny an award, to the extent that the prevailing party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy.

I11(D) If, in a civil action brought by the United States or a proceeding for judicial review of an adversary adjudication described in section 504(a)(4) of title 5, the demand by the United States is substantially in excess of the judgment finally obtained by the United States and is unreasonable when compared with such judgment, under the facts and circumstances of the case, the court shall award to the party the fees and other expenses related to defending against the excessive demand, unless the party has committed a willful violation of law or otherwise acted in bad faith, or special circumstances make an award unjust. Fees and expenses awarded under this subparagraph shall be paid only as a consequence of appropriations provided in advance.

I11(2) For the purposes of this subsection_

I12(A) ``fees and other expenses'' includes the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project which is found by the court to be necessary for the preparation of the party's case, and reasonable attorney fees (The amount of fees awarded under this subsection shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that (i) no expert witness shall be compensated at a rate in excess of the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the United States; and (ii) attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.);

I12(B) ``party'' means (i) an individual whose net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed, or (ii) any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization, the net worth of which did not exceed $7,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed, and which had not more than 500 employees at the time the civil action was filed; except that an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code, or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), may be a party regardless of the net worth of such organization or cooperative association or for purposes of subsection (d)(1)(D), a small entity as defined in section 601 of title 5;

I12(C) ``United States'' includes any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity;

I12(D) ``position of the United States'' means, in addition to the position taken by the United States in the civil action, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based; except that fees and expenses may not be awarded to a party for any portion of the litigation in which the party has unreasonably protracted the proceedings;

I12(E) ``civil action brought by or against the United States'' includes an appeal by a party, other than the United States, from a decision of a contracting officer rendered pursuant to a disputes clause in a contract with the Government or pursuant to chapter 71 of title 41;

I12(F) ``court'' includes the United States Court of Federal Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims;

I12(G) ``final judgment'' means a judgment that is final and not appealable, and includes an order of settlement;

I12(H) ``prevailing party'', in the case of eminent domain proceedings, means a party who obtains a final judgment (other than by settlement), exclusive of interest, the amount of which is at least as close to the highest valuation of the property involved that is attested to at trial on behalf of the property owner as it is to the highest valuation of the property involved that is attested to at trial on behalf of the Government; and

I12(I) ``demand'' means the express demand of the United States which led to the adversary adjudication, but shall not include a recitation of the maximum statutory penalty (i) in the complaint, or (ii) elsewhere when accompanied by an express demand for a lesser amount.

I11(3) In awarding fees and other expenses under this subsection to a prevailing party in any action for judicial review of an adversary adjudication, as defined in subsection (b)(1)(C) of section 504 of title 5, United States Code, or an adversary adjudication subject to chapter 71 of title 41, the court shall include in that award fees and other expenses to the same extent authorized in subsection (a) of such section, unless the court finds that during such adversary adjudication the position of the United States was substantially justified, or that special circumstances make an award unjust.

I11(4) Fees and other expenses awarded under this subsection to a party shall be paid by any agency over which the party prevails from any funds made available to the agency by appropriation or otherwise.

I11(e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any costs, fees, and other expenses in connection with any proceeding to which section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies (determined without regard to subsections (b) and (f) of such section). Nothing in the preceding sentence shall prevent the awarding under subsection (a) of section 2412 of title 28, United States Code, of costs enumerated in section 1920 of such title (as in effect on October 1, 1981).

I11(f) If the United States appeals an award of costs or fees and other expenses made against the United States under this section and the award is affirmed in whole or in part, interest shall be paid on the amount of the award as affirmed. Such interest shall be computed at the rate determined under section 1961(a) of this title, and shall run from the date of the award through the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.

I21Subsection (a) is new. It follows the well-known common-law rule that a sovereign is not liable for costs unless specific provision for such liability is made by law. This is a corollary to the rule that a sovereign cannot be sued without its consent.

I21Many enactments of Congress relating to fees and costs contain specific exceptions as to the liability of the United States. (See, for example, section 548 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.) A uniform rule, embodied in this section, will make such specific exceptions unnecessary.

I89. Mode of recovery

I11(a) Whenever a civil fine, penalty or pecuniary forfeiture is prescribed for the violation of an Act of Congress without specifying the mode of recovery or enforcement thereof, it may be recovered in a civil action.

I11(b) Unless otherwise provided by Act of Congress, whenever a forfeiture of property is prescribed as a penalty for violation of an Act of Congress and the seizure takes place on the high seas or on navigable waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, such forfeiture may be enforced by libel in admiralty but in cases of seizures on land the forfeiture may be enforced by a proceeding by libel which shall conform as near as may be to proceedings in admiralty.

I11(c) If a person is charged in a criminal case with a violation of an Act of Congress for which the civil or criminal forfeiture of property is authorized, the Government may include notice of the forfeiture in the indictment or information pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. If the defendant is convicted of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture, the court shall order the forfeiture of the property as part of the sentence in the criminal case pursuant to toÿ1A\1\N the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3554 of title 18, United States Code. The procedures in section 413 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 853) apply to all stages of a criminal forfeiture proceeding, except that subsection (d) of such section applies only in cases in which the defendant is convicted of a violation of such Act.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Subsection (a) was drafted to clarify a serious ambiguity in existing law and is based upon rulings of the Supreme Court. Numerous sections in the United States Code prescribe civil fines, penalties, and pecuniary forfeitures for violation of certain sections without specifying the mode of recovery or enforcement thereof. See, for example, section 567 of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking, section 64 of title 14, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Coast Guard, and section 180 of title 25, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Indians. Compare section 1 (21) of title 49, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Transportation.

I21A civil fine, penalty, or pecuniary forfeiture is recoverable in a civil action. T3United States ex rel. Marcus v. HessK et al., 1943, 63 S.Ct. 379, 317 U.S. 537, 87 L.Ed. 433, rehearing denied 63 S.Ct. 756, 318 U.S. 799, 87 L.Ed. 1163; T3Hepner v. United StatesK, 1909, 29 S.Ct. 474, 213 U.S. 103, 53 L.Ed. 720, and cases cited therein.

I21Forfeiture of bail bonds in criminal cases are enforceable by procedure set out in Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

I21If the statute contemplates a criminal fine, it can only be recovered in a criminal proceeding under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, after a conviction. The collection of civil fines and penalties, however, may not be had under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 54(b)(5), but enforcement of a criminal fine imposed in a criminal case may be had by execution on the judgment rendered in such case, as in civil actions. (See section 569 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, incorporated in section 3565 of H.R. 1600, 80th Congress, for revision of the Criminal Code. See also Rule 69 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Advisory Committee Note thereunder, as to execution in civil actions.)

I21Subsection (b) was drafted to cover the subject of forfeiture of property generally. Sections in the United States Code specifically providing a mode of enforcement of forfeiture of property for their violation and other procedural matters will, of course, govern and subsection (b) will not affect them. It will only cover cases where no mode of recovery is prescribed.

I21Words ``Unless otherwise provided by enactment of Congress'' were inserted at the beginning of subsection (b) to exclude from its application instances where a libel in admiralty is not required. For example, under sections 1607, 1609, and 1610 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, the collector of customs may, by summary procedure, sell at public auction, without previous declaration of forfeiture or libel proceedings, any vessel, etc., under $1,000 in value in cases where no claim for the same is filed or bond given as required by customs laws.

I21Rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure makes such rules applicable to the appeals in cases of seizures on land. (See also T3443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United StatesK, 1912, 33 S.Ct. 50, 226 U.S. 172, 57 L.Ed. 174, and T3Eureka Productions v. MulliganK, C.C.A. 1940, 108 F.2d 760.) The proceeding, which resembles a suit in admiralty in that it is begun by a libel, is, strictly speaking, an ``action at law'' (The Sarah, 1823, 8 Wheat. 391, 21 U.S. 391, 5 L.Ed. 644; Morris's Cotton, 1869, 8 Wall. 507, 75 U.S. 507, 19 L.Ed. 481; Confiscation cases, 1873, 20 Wall. 92, 87 U.S. 92, 22 L.Ed. 320; T3Eureka Productions v. MulliganK, supra), even though the statute may direct that the proceedings conform to admiralty as near as may be. T3In re GrahamK, 1870, 10 Wall. 541, 19 L.Ed. 981, and T3443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United StatesK, supra.

I21Subsection (b) is in conformity with Rule 21 of the Supreme Court Admiralty Rules, which recognizes that a libel may be filed upon seizure for any breach of any enactment of Congress, whether on land or on the high seas or on navigable waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. Such rule also permits an information to be filed, but is rarely, if ever, used at present. Consequently, ``information'' has been omitted from the text and only ``libel'' is incorporated.

In the event of the inability or refusal of the parties to so stipulate, the court shall fix the amount, but if not so fixed then a bond shall be required in the amount prescribed in this section.

I21Section consolidates limitation provisions of sections 250(2), 250a, and 262 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.

I21Words ``a person under legal disability or beyond the seas at the time the claim accrues'' were substituted for ``married women first accrued during marriage, of persons under the age of twenty-one years first accrued during minority, and of idiots, lunatics, insane persons, and persons beyond the seas at the time the claim accrued; entitled to the claim,''. The revised language will cover all legal disabilities actually barring suit. For example, the particular reference to married women is archaic, and is eliminated by use of the general language substituted.

I21Words ``nor shall any of the said disabilities operate cumulatively'' were omitted, in view of the elimination of the reference to specific disabilities. Also, persons under legal disability could not sue, and their suits should not be barred until they become able to sue. Similar sections of the U.S. Code do not contain any such provision. (For example, see section 502 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., incorporated in section 544 of this title.)

I74Congressional Findings and Purposes

I21Pub. L. 100ÿ09694, ÿ1A2, Nov. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 4563, provided that:

I21``(a) T4FindingsK._The Congress finds and declares the following:

I22``(1) For more than 40 years the Federal Tort Claims Act [see Short Title note above] has been the legal mechanism for compensating persons injured by negligent or wrongful acts of Federal employees committed within the scope of their employment.

I22``(2) The United States, through the Federal Tort Claims Act, is responsible to injured persons for the common law torts of its employees in the same manner in which the common law historically has recognized the responsibility of an employer for torts committed by its employees within the scope of their employment.

I22``(3) Because Federal employees for many years have been protected from personal common law tort liability by a broad based immunity, the Federal Tort Claims Act has served as the sole means for compensating persons injured by the tortious conduct of Federal employees.

I22``(4) Recent judicial decisions, and particularly the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Westfall v. Erwin, have seriously eroded the common law tort immunity previously available to Federal employees.

I22``(5) This erosion of immunity of Federal employees from common law tort liability has created an immediate crisis involving the prospect of personal liability and the threat of protracted personal tort litigation for the entire Federal workforce.

I22``(6) The prospect of such liability will seriously undermine the morale and well being of Federal employees, impede the ability of agencies to carry out their missions, and diminish the vitality of the Federal Tort Claims Act as the proper remedy for Federal employee torts.

I22``(7) In its opinion in Westfall v. Erwin, the Supreme Court indicated that the Congress is in the best position to determine the extent to which Federal employees should be personally liable for common law torts, and that legislative consideration of this matter would be useful.

I21``(b) T4PurposeK._It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note under section 1 of this title] to protect Federal employees from personal liability for common law torts committed within the scope of their employment, while providing persons injured by the common law torts of Federal employees with an appropriate remedy against the United States.''

I89. Administrative adjustment of claims

I11The head of each Federal agency or his designee, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, may consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim for money damages against the United States for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the agency while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred: T3ProvidedK, That any award, compromise, or settlement in excess of $25,000 shall be effected only with the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his designee. Notwithstanding the proviso contained in the preceding sentence, any award, compromise, or settlement may be effected without the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his or her designee, to the extent that the Attorney General delegates to the head of the agency the authority to make such award, compromise, or settlement. Such delegations may not exceed the authority delegated by the Attorney General to the United States attorneys to settle claims for money damages against the United States. Each Federal agency may use arbitration, or other alternative means of dispute resolution under the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5, to settle any tort claim against the United States, to the extent of the agency's authority to award, compromise, or settle such claim without the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his or her designee.

I11Subject to the provisions of this title relating to civil actions on tort claims against the United States, any such award, compromise, settlement, or determination shall be final and conclusive on all officers of the Government, except when procured by means of fraud.

I11Any award, compromise, or settlement in an amount of $2,500 or less made pursuant to this section shall be paid by the head of the Federal agency concerned out of appropriations available to that agency. Payment of any award, compromise, or settlement in an amount in excess of $2,500 made pursuant to this section or made by the Attorney General in any amount pursuant to section 2677 of this title shall be paid in a manner similar to judgments and compromises in like causes and appropriations or funds available for the payment of such judgments and compromises are hereby made available for the payment of awards, compromises, or settlements under this chapter.

I11The acceptance by the claimant of any such award, compromise, or settlement shall be final and conclusive on the claimant, and shall constitute a complete release of any claim against the United States and against the employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, by reason of the same subject matter.

The Government says it must take this property at this time because [recite the pertinent ground or grounds from section 3101(b)]. The Government wants to make sure [name of debtor] will pay if the court determines that this money is owed.

I11``If you are [name of debtor] and you disagree with the reason the Government gives for taking your property now, or if you think you do not owe the money to the Government that it says you do, or if you think the property the Government is taking qualifies under one of the above exemptions, you have a right to ask the court to return your property to you.

You may make any or all of these explanations as you see fit.

I11``If you think you live outside the Federal judicial district in which the court is located, you may request, not later than 20 days after you receive this notice, that this proceeding to take your property be transferred by the court to the Federal judicial district in which you reside.

I11(2) Such lien shall be ranked ahead of any other security interests perfected after the later of the time of levy and the time a copy of the notice of levy is filed under subsection (d)(5).

I11(3) Such lien shall arise from the time of levy and shall continue until a judgment in the action is obtained or denied, or the action is otherwise dismissed.

I11(i) T4Preservation of Personal Property Under AttachmentK._If personal property in custody of the United States marshal under a writ of attachment is not replevied, claimed, or sold, the court may make such order for its preservation or use as appears to be in the interest of the parties.

I89. Assumption of contractual obligations related to transfers of rights in motion pictures

I11(a) T4Assumption of ObligationsK._(1) In the case of a transfer of copyright ownership under United States law in a motion picture (as the terms ``transfer of copyright ownership'' and ``motion picture'' are defined in section 101 of title 17) that is produced subject to 1 or more collective bargaining agreements negotiated under the laws of the United States, if the transfer is executed on or after the effective date of this chapter and is not limited to public performance rights, the transfer instrument shall be deemed to incorporate the assumption agreements applicable to the copyright ownership being transferred that are required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement, and the transferee shall be subject to the obligations under each such assumption agreement to make residual payments and provide related notices, accruing after the effective date of the transfer and applicable to the exploitation of the rights transferred, and any remedies under each such assumption agreement for breach of those obligations, as those obligations and remedies are set forth in the applicable collective bargaining agreement, if_

I12(A) the transferee knows or has reason to know at the time of the transfer that such collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture; or

I12(B) in the event of a court order confirming an arbitration award against the transferor under the collective bargaining agreement, the transferor does not have the financial ability to satisfy the award within 90 days after the order is issued.

Q04

I11(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), ``knows or has reason to know'' means any of the following:

I12(A) Actual knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture.

I12(B)(i) Constructive knowledge that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture, arising from recordation of a document pertaining to copyright in the motion picture under section 205 of title 17 or from publication, at a site available to the public on-line that is operated by the relevant union, of information that identifies the motion picture as subject to a collective bargaining agreement with that union, if the site permits commercially reasonable verification of the date on which the information was available for access.

I12(ii) Clause (i) applies only if the transfer referred to in subsection (a)(1) occurs_

I13(I) after the motion picture is completed, or

I13(II) before the motion picture is completed and_

I14(aa) within 18 months before the filing of an application for copyright registration for the motion picture under section 408 of title 17, or

I14(bb) if no such application is filed, within 18 months before the first publication of the motion picture in the United States.

Q04

I12(C) Awareness of other facts and circumstances pertaining to a particular transfer from which it is apparent that the collective bargaining agreement was or will be applicable to the motion picture.

Q04

I11(b) T4Scope of Exclusion of Transfers of Public Performance RightsK._For purposes of this section, the exclusion under subsection (a) of transfers of copyright ownership in a motion picture that are limited to public performance rights includes transfers to a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer to the extent that the station, system, or programmer is functioning as an exhibitor of the motion picture, either by exhibiting the motion picture on its own network, system, service, or station, or by initiating the transmission of an exhibition that is carried on another network, system, service, or station. When a terrestrial broadcast station, cable system, or programmer, or other transferee, is also functioning otherwise as a distributor or as a producer of the motion picture, the public performance exclusion does not affect any obligations imposed on the transferee to the extent that it is engaging in such functions.

I11(c) T4Exclusion for Grants of Security InterestsK._Subsection (a) shall not apply to_

I12(1) a transfer of copyright ownership consisting solely of a mortgage, hypothecation, or other security interest; or

I12(2) a subsequent transfer of the copyright ownership secured by the security interest described in paragraph (1) by or under the authority of the secured party, including a transfer through the exercise of the secured party's rights or remedies as a secured party, or by a subsequent transferee.

Q04

I10The exclusion under this subsection shall not affect any rights or remedies under law or contract.

I11(d) T4Deferral Pending Resolution of Bona Fide DisputeK._A transferee on which obligations are imposed under subsection (a) by virtue of paragraph (1) of that subsection may elect to defer performance of such obligations that are subject to a bona fide dispute between a union and a prior transferor until that dispute is resolved, except that such deferral shall not stay accrual of any union claims due under an applicable collective bargaining agreement.

I11(e) T4Scope of Obligations Determined by Private AgreementK._Nothing in this section shall expand or diminish the rights, obligations, or remedies of any person under the collective bargaining agreements or assumption agreements referred to in this section.

I11(f) T4Failure To NotifyK._If the transferor under subsection (a) fails to notify the transferee under subsection (a) of applicable collective bargaining obligations before the execution of the transfer instrument, and subsection (a) is made applicable to the transferee solely by virtue of subsection (a)(1)(B), the transferor shall be liable to the transferee for any damages suffered by the transferee as a result of the failure to notify.

I11(g) T4Determination of Disputes and ClaimsK._Any dispute concerning the application of subsections (a) through (f) shall be determined by an action in United States district court, and the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party and may also award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.

I11(h) T4StudyK._The Comptroller General, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, shall conduct a study of the conditions in the motion picture industry that gave rise to this section, and the impact of this section on the motion picture industry. The Comptroller General shall report the findings of the study to the Congress within 2 years after the effective date of this chapter.

I74Findings

I21Pub. L. 111ÿ09223, ÿ1A2, Aug. 10, 2010, 124 Stat. 2380, provided that: ``Congress finds the following:

I22``(1) The freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the first amendment to the Constitution, and is necessary to promote the vigorous dialogue necessary to shape public policy in a representative democracy.

I22``(2) Some persons are obstructing the free expression rights of United States authors and publishers, and in turn chilling the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States interest of the citizenry in receiving information on matters of importance, by seeking out foreign jurisdictions that do not provide the full extent of free-speech protections to authors and publishers that are available in the United States, and suing a United States author or publisher in that foreign jurisdiction.

I22``(3) These foreign defamation lawsuits not only suppress the free speech rights of the defendants to the suit, but inhibit other written speech that might otherwise have been written or published but for the fear of a foreign lawsuit.

I22``(4) The threat of the libel laws of some foreign countries is so dramatic that the United Nations Human Rights Committee examined the issue and indicated that in some instances the law of libel has served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work. The advent of the internet and the international distribution of foreign media also create the danger that one country's unduly restrictive libel law will affect freedom of expression worldwide on matters of valid public interest.

I22``(5) Governments and courts of foreign countries scattered around the world have failed to curtail this practice of permitting libel lawsuits against United States persons within their courts, and foreign libel judgments inconsistent with United States first amendment protections are increasingly common.''

I13(B) even if the defamation law applied in the foreign court's adjudication did not provide as much protection for freedom of speech and press as the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State, the party opposing recognition or enforcement of that foreign judgment would have been found liable for defamation by a domestic court applying the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State in which the domestic court is located.

I12(2) T4Burden of establishing consistency of judgmentK._The party seeking recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment shall bear the burden of establishing that the judgment is consistent with section 230.

Q04

I12(1) affect the enforceability of any foreign judgment other than a foreign judgment for defamation; or
