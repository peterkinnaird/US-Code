<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Upon vessels which shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place there shall be paid duties as follows: On vessels built within the United States but belonging wholly or in part to subjects of foreign powers, at the rate of thirty cents per ton; on other vessels not of the United States, at the rate of fifty cents per ton, and any vessel any officer of which shall not be a citizen of the United States shall pay a tax of fifty cents per ton.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">A tonnage duty of 9 cents per ton, not to exceed in the aggregate 45 cents per ton in any one year, for fiscal years 1991 through 2002, and 2 cents per ton, not to exceed in the aggregate 10 cents per ton in any one year, for each fiscal year thereafter is imposed at each entry on all vessels which shall be entered in any port of the United States from any foreign port or place in North America, Central America, the West India Islands, the Bahama Islands, the Bermuda Islands, or the coast of South America bordering on the Caribbean Sea, or Newfoundland, and on all vessels (except vessels of the United States, recreational vessels, and barges, as those terms are defined in section 2101 of title 46) that depart a United States port or place and return to the same port or place without being entered in the United States from another port or place; and a duty of 27 cents per ton, not to exceed $1.35 per ton per annum, for fiscal years 1991 through 2002, and 6 cents per ton, not to exceed 30 cents per ton per annum, for each fiscal year thereafter is imposed at each entry on all vessels which shall be entered in any port of the United States from any other foreign port. However, neither duty shall be imposed on vessels in distress or not engaged in trade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon every vessel not of the United States, which shall be entered in one district from another district, having on board goods, wares, or merchandise taken in one district to be delivered in another district, duties shall be paid at the rate of 50 cents per ton: <em>Provided</em>, That no such duty shall be required where a vessel owned by citizens of the United States, but not a vessel of the United States, after entering an American port, shall, before leaving the same, be registered as a vessel of the United States. On all foreign vessels which shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place, to and with which vessels of the United States are not ordinarily permitted to enter and trade, there shall be paid a duty at the rate of $2 per ton; and none of the duties on tonnage above mentioned shall be levied on the vessels of any foreign nation if the President of the United States shall be satisfied that the discriminating or countervailing duties of such foreign nations, so far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States, have been abolished. Any rights or privileges acquired by any foreign nation under the laws and treaties of the United States relative to the duty of tonnage on vessels shall not be impaired; and any vessel any officer of which shall not be a citizen of the United States shall pay a tax of 50 cents per ton.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;4219 derived from acts July 20, 1790, ch. 30, &sect;1, 1 Stat. 135; Apr. 27, 1816, ch. 107, &sect;6, 3 Stat. 314; Jan. 14, 1817, ch. 3, &sect;1, 3 Stat. 344; Mar. 1, 1817, ch. 31, &sect;6, 3 Stat. 352; Mar. 3, 1817, ch. 50, 3 Stat. 369; May 31, 1830, ch. 219, &sect;1, 4 Stat. 425; July 14, 1862, ch. 163, &sect;15, 12 Stat. 558; June 28, 1864, ch. 170, 13 Stat. 201; Mar. 3, 1865, ch. 80, &sect;4, 13 Stat. 493.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first and third paragraphs of this section, with the exception of the proviso in the third paragraph, are from R.S. &sect;4219.</p>
<p class="note-body">A portion of that section omitted here provided that, in addition to the tonnage duty thereby imposed there should be paid a tax, at the rate of thirty cents per ton, on vessels entered at any custom house from any foreign port or place.</p>
<p class="note-body">It was probably omitted as superseded and repealed by act June 26, 1884, as amended by acts June 19, 1886, ch. 421, &sect;11, 24 Stat. 81; Apr. 4, 1888, and Aug. 5, 1909.</p>
<p class="note-body">Another portion of the original text, concerning the impairment of rights and privileges of foreign nations under laws and treaties was probably omitted as sufficiently covered by the similar provision near the end of the section.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second paragraph of this section is from act Aug. 5, 1909, &sect;36. Portions of that paragraph omitted here, fixed the time of its taking effect, repealed R.S. &sect;4232, act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, &sect;&sect;11 and 12, 24 Stat. 81, and so much of R.S. &sect;4219 as conflicted therewith, and provided that it should not be construed to amend or repeal R.S. &sect;2792, as amended, act May 28, 1908, ch. 212, &sect;5, 35 Stat. 425, or R.S. &sect;2793. That paragraph was expressly excepted from repeal by Underwood Tariff Act Oct. 13, 1913, ch. 16, &sect;IV, S, 38 Stat. 201.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proviso in the third paragraph of this section is based on act Mar. 4, 1915. Other provisions of that act are classified to section 128 of this Appendix, and sections 128 and 131 of Title 19, Customs Duties.</p>
<p class="note-body">So much of act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, &sect;11, 24 Stat. 81, as exempted any yacht built outside the United States, and owned, chartered or used by a citizen of the United States, from the payment of tonnage taxes, was repealed by act Feb. 5, 1897, ch. 167, &sect;2, 29 Stat. 511. Act June 19, 1886, having been repealed as above stated section 2 of act Feb. 5, 1897, ch. 167, is no longer operative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 12 of act June 19, 1886, which was repealed by the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of Aug. 5, 1909, &sect;36, directed the President to cause the Governments of foreign countries, which, at any of their ports, imposed on American vessels a tonnage tax or light house dues, etc., to be informed of the provisions of section 11, and invited to co-operate with the Government of the United States in abolishing light house dues, etc.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;4223, provided that the tonnage duty imposed on all vessels engaged in foreign commerce should be levied but once within a year, and that when paid no further tonnage tax should be collected within one year from the date of such payment, not being applicable, however, to foreign vessels entered in the United States from any foreign port, to and with which vessels of the United States were not ordinarily permitted to enter and trade.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;4224, provided that vessels paying tonnage duties once a year should pay them at their first clearance from or entry at, according to priority, a custom house in the United States in each calendar year, but that it should not prevent customs officers from collecting such tonnage duty at the entry of vessels at their respective custom houses during the calendar year if the same had not previously been paid for such year.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both these sections were repealed by act June 26, 1884, as amended by act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, &sect;11, 24 Stat. 81.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:9 --><p class="note-body">Act June 19, 1878, ch. 318, 20 Stat. 171, amended R.S. &sect;2931, by providing that it should not apply to cases of the payment of tonnage tax on vessels where the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General were satisfied that the exaction of the tax was in contravention of treaty provisions. R.S. &sect;2931, which provided for an appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury from the decision of the collector of customs as to the rate and amount of tonnage duties, etc., was repealed by act June 10, 1890, ch. 407, &sect;29, 26 Stat. 141. Act June 19, 1878, further provided that the Secretary of the Treasury might draw his warrant for the refund of taxes so illegally exacted, as provided for by R.S. &sect;30121/2. R.S. &sect;30121/2, was also repealed by act June 10, 1890, &sect;29. By the repeal of R.S. &sect;&sect;2931, 30121/2, act June 19, 1878, ch. 318, became inoperative.</p>
<p class="note-body">Act Feb. 10, 1900, ch. 15, &sect;2, 31 Stat. 27, authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to refund tonnage taxes and light dues imposed on vessels owned by citizens of Cuba entering ports of the United States since Apr. 11, 1899, which had been in excess of the taxes prescribed by act June 19, 1886, ch. 421, &sect;11, 24 Stat. 81. It was doubtless omitted from the code as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">R.S. &sect;4232, repealed by the same section, provided that mail steamships employed in the mail-service between the United States and Brazil, should be exempt from all port charges and customs dues at the port of departure and arrival in the United States, if and so long as a similar immunity from port charges and custom-house charges was granted by the government of Brazil.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 37 of act Aug. 5, 1909, which provided for a tonnage tax on foreign built yachts, pleasure boats or vessels, not used or intended to be used for trade, owned, or chartered for more than six months by citizens of the United States, or, in lieu thereof, an ad valorem duty, and entitled such yachts, etc., upon payment thereof to all the privileges, subjected them to all the requirements prescribed by R.S. &sect;&sect;4214, 4215, 4217, 4218, and acts amendatory thereof, in the same manner as if they had been built in the United States, subjected such yachts, etc., to tonnage duty and light money only in the same manner as if they had been built in the United States, repealed so much of act May 28, 1908, ch. 212, &sect;5, 35 Stat. 425, as related to yachts built outside the United States and owned by citizens of the United States, and provided that the section should not apply to foreign built vessels admitted to American registry, was repealed by the Underwood Tariff Act of Oct. 13, 1913, ch. 16, &sect;IV, S, 38 Stat. 201.</p>
<p class="note-body">Act June 5, 1920, ch. 250, &sect;34, 41 Stat. 1007, directed the President to give notice to terminate provisions of treaties or conventions restricting the right of the United States to impose discriminating customs duties and tonnage dues. It was doubtless omitted as temporary and executed.</p>

within the coastwise laws, either directly or via a foreign port, or for any part of the transportation, in any other vessel than a vessel built in and documented under the laws of the United States

foreign registry, shall hereafter acquire the right to engage in the coastwise trade: <em>Provided further</em>, That no vessel which has acquired the lawful right to engage in the coastwise trade, by virtue of having been built in or documented under the laws of the United States, and which has later been rebuilt shall have the right thereafter to engage in the coastwise trade, unless the entire rebuilding, including the construction of any major components of the hull or superstructure of the vessel, is effected within the United States, its territories (not including trust territories), or its possessions: <em>Provided further</em>, That this section shall not apply to merchandise transported between points within the continental United States, including Alaska, over through routes heretofore or hereafter recognized by the Surface Transportation Board for which routes rate tariffs have been or shall hereafter be filed with the Board when such routes are in part over Canadian

further</em>, That this section shall not apply to the transportation of merchandise loaded on railroad cars or to motor vehicles with or without trailers, and with their passengers or contents when accompanied by the operator thereof, when such railroad cars or motor vehicles are transported in any railroad car ferry operated between fixed termini on the Great Lakes as a part of a rail route, if such car ferry is owned by a common carrier by water and operated as part of a rail route with the approval of the Surface Transportation Board, and if the stock of such common carrier by water, or its predecessor, was owned or controlled by a common carrier by rail prior to June 5, 1920, and if the stock of the common carrier owning such car ferry is, with the approval of the Board, now owned or controlled by any common carrier by rail and if such car ferry is built in and documented under the laws of the United States: <em>Provided further</em>, That upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury by regulation may prescribe, and, if the transporting vessel is of foreign registry, upon a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to information obtained and furnished by the Secretary of State, that the government of the nation of registry extends reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States, this section shall not apply to the transportation by vessels of the United States not qualified to engage in the coastwise trade, or by vessels of foreign registry, of (a) empty cargo vans, empty lift vans, and empty shipping tanks, (b) equipment for use with cargo vans, lift vans, or shipping tanks, (c) empty barges specifically designed for carriage aboard a vessel and equipment, excluding propulsion equipment, for use with such barges, and (d) any empty instrument for international traffic exempted from application of the customs laws by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of section 1322(a) of title 19, if the articles described in clauses (a) through (d) <!-- PDFPage:60 -->are owned or leased by the owner or operator of the transporting vessel and are transported for his use in handling his cargo in foreign trade;

contracting for the lading or unlading of that vessel, and is transported without charge for use in the handling of cargo in foreign trade: <em>Provided further</em>, That upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury by regulation may prescribe, and, if the transporting vessel is of foreign registry, upon his finding, pursuant to information furnished by the Secretary of State, that the government of the nation of registry extends reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury may suspend the application of this section to the transportation of merchandise between points in the United States (excluding transportation between the continental United States and noncontiguous states, districts, territories, and possessions embraced within the coastwise laws) which, while moving in the foreign trade of the United States, is transferred from a non-self-propelled barge certified by the owner or operator to be specifically designed for carriage aboard a vessel and regularly carried aboard a vessel in foreign trade to another such barge owned or leased by the same owner or operator, without regard to whether any such barge is under foreign registry or qualified to engage in the coastwise trade: <em>Provided further</em>, That until April 1, 1984, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, any vessel documented under the laws of the United States and owned by persons who are citizens of the United States may, when operated upon a voyage in foreign trade, transport merchandise in cargo vans, lift vans, and shipping-tanks between points embraced within the coastwise laws for transfer to or when transferred from another vessel or vessels, so documented and owned, of the same operator when the

of prior to November 16, 1979, and (2) shall not apply to movements between points in the contiguous United States and points in Hawaii, Alaska, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and United States territories and possessions. For the purposes of this section, after December 31, 1983, or after such time as an appropriate vessel has been constructed and documented as a vessel of the United States, the transportation of hazardous waste, as defined in section 6903(5) of title 42, from a point in the United States for the purpose of the incineration at sea of that waste shall be deemed to be transportation by water of merchandise between points in the United States: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the provisions of this sentence shall not apply to this transportation when performed by a foreign-flag ocean incineration vessel, owned by or under construction on May 1, 1982, for a corporation wholly owned by a citizen of the United States; the term &ldquo;citizen of the United States&rdquo;, as used in this proviso, means a corporation as defined in section 802(a) and (b) of this Appendix. The incineration equipment on these vessels shall meet all current United States Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency standards. These vessels shall, in addition to any other inspections by the flag state, be inspected by the United States Coast Guard, including drydock inspections and internal examinations of tanks and void spaces, as would be required of a vessel of the United States. Satisfactory inspection shall be certified in writing by the Secretary of Transportation. Such inspections may occur concurrently with any inspections required by the flag state or subsequent to but no more than one year after the initial issuance or the next scheduled issuance of the Safety of Life at Sea Safety Construction Certificate. In making such inspections, the Coast Guard shall refer to the conditions established by the initial flag state certification as the basis for evaluating the current condition of the hull and superstructure. The Coast Guard shall allow the substitution of an equivalent fitting, material, appliance, apparatus, or equipment other than that required for vessels of the United States if the Coast Guard has been satisfied that fitting, material, appliance, apparatus, or equipment is at least as effective as that required for vessels of the United States&nbsp;<sup><a href="#883_3_target" name="883_3">3</a></sup> <em>Provided further</em>, That for the purposes of this section, supplies aboard United States documented fish processing vessels, which are necessary and used for the processing or assembling of fishery products aboard such vessels, shall be considered ship's equipment and not merchandise: <em>Provided further</em>, That for purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;merchandise&rdquo; includes valueless material: <em>Provided further</em>, That this section applies to the transportation of valueless material or any dredged material regardless of whether it has commercial value, from a point or place in the United States or a point or place on the high seas within the Exclusive Economic Zone as defined in the Presidential Proclamation of March 10, 1983, to another point or place in the United States or a point or place on the high seas within that Exclusive Economic Zone: <em>Provided further</em>, That the transportation of any platform jacket in or on a non-coastwise qualified launch barge, that was built before December 31, 2000, and has a launch capacity of 12,000 long tons or more, between two points in the United States, at one of which there is an installation or other device within the meaning of section 1333(a) of title 43, shall not be deemed transportation subject to this section if the Secretary of Transportation makes a determination, in accordance with procedures established pursuant to this proviso that a suitable coastwise-qualified vessel is not available for use in the transportation and, if needed, launch or installation of a platform jacket and; that the Secretary of Transportation shall adopt procedures implementing this proviso that are reasonably designed to provide timely information so as to maximize the use of coastwise qualified-vessels, which procedures shall, among other things, establish that for purposes of this proviso, a coastwise-qualified vessel shall be <!-- PDFPage:61 -->deemed to be not available only (1) if upon application by an owner or operator for the use of a non-coastwise qualified launch barge for transportation of a platform jacket under this section, which application shall include all relevant information, including engineering details and timing requirements, the Secretary promptly publishes a notice in the Federal Register describing the project and the platform jacket involved, advising that all relevant information reasonably needed to assess the transportation requirements for the platform jacket will be made available to interested parties upon request, and requesting that information on the availability of coastwise-qualified vessels be submitted within 30 days after publication of that notice; and (2) if either (A) no information is submitted to the Secretary within that 30 day period, or (B) although the owner or operator of a coastwise-qualified vessel submits information to the Secretary asserting that the owner or operator has a suitable coastwise-qualified vessel available for this transportation, the Secretary, within 90 days of the date on which the notice is first published determines that the coastwise-qualified vessel is not suitable or reasonably available for the transportation; and that, for the purposes of this proviso, the term &ldquo;coastwise-qualified vessel&rdquo; means a vessel that has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under section 12106 of title 46 and the term &ldquo;platform jacket&rdquo; refers to a single physical component and includes any type of offshore exploration, development, or production structure or component thereof, including platform jackets, tension leg or SPAR platform superstructures (including the deck, drilling rig and support utilities, and supporting structure), hull (including vertical legs and connecting pontoons or vertical cylinder), tower and base sections of a platform jacket, jacket structures, and deck modules (known as &ldquo;topsides&rdquo;).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for the reorganization of maritime functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The basic objective of the plan is to strengthen and revitalize the administration of our Federal programs concerned with the promotion and development of the U.S. merchant marine by concentrating responsibility in separate agencies for the performance of regulatory and promotional functions. The plan provides, therefore, for the creation of a separate Federal Maritime Commission, composed of five Commissioners, which would be charged with the regulatory functions of the present Federal Maritime Board. There would be transferred from the Federal Maritime Board to the Secretary of Commerce the award of subsidies and related promotional functions. The Secretary of Commerce would retain the functions transferred to him by Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950 which reorganized the U.S. Maritime Commission into a Federal Maritime Board and a Maritime Administration in the Department of Commerce. The plan retains the present Maritime Administration, provides for an Administrator as head thereof, retains a Deputy Maritime Administrator, and effects no change in the Office of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation. The Federal Maritime Board is abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">Existing organizational arrangements have not proved to be satisfactory. The development and maintenance of a sound maritime industry require that the Federal Government carry out its dual responsibilities for regulation and promotion with equal vigor and effectiveness. Intermingling of regulatory and promotional functions has tended in this instance to dilute responsibility and has led to serious inadequacies, particularly in the administration of regulatory functions. Recent findings by committees of the Congress disclose serious violations of maritime laws and point to the urgent need for a reorganization to vest in completely separate agencies a responsibility for (1) regulatory functions and (2) promotional and operating functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The plan would provide the most appropriate organizational framework for each of the functions concerned. Regulation would be made the exclusive responsibility of a separate commission organized along the general lines of other regulatory agencies. On the other hand, nonregulatory functions, including the determination and award of subsidies and other promotional and operating activities, would be concentrated in the head of the Department of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce is best qualified to coordinate these activities with other transportation and related economic programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">The vesting of all subsidy functions in the Secretary of Commerce will make it possible for the Congress and the President to hold a single official responsible and accountable for the effective conduct of all aspects of this program, including the size and character of the fleet under the U.S. flag, the need for Government assistance, and requirements for appropriations to support subsidy programs. Furthermore, the placing of these functions in the Secretary of Commerce will assure essential supervision and review of subsidy awards.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in the accompanying reorganization plan will result in a modest increase in expenditures. The improved organizational alinements provided by the plan will, however, make possible a more effective and expeditious administration of the statutory objectives to foster and promote a U.S. merchant marine capable of meeting the Nation's needs in peace and war. Failure to meet these objectives would be far more costly than the anticipated increase in expenditures under the plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of new officers specified in sections 102 and 201 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan effects a basic reorganization of the functions of the United States Maritime Commission along the lines recommended by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Within the last 3 years three different bodies have studied the administration of the Maritime Commission. All have concluded that the operating deficiencies of the agency arise from inappropriate and unsound organization and that a fundamental reorganization is essential. The first of these bodies, the President's Advisory Committee on the Merchant Marine, in 1947, stated:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">It appears to the Committee that the organization structure of the Maritime Commission as set up in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is wholly inadequate for the efficient conduct of the multitude of diverse activities for which the Maritime Commission is now responsible. The deficiencies of the statutory organization for administrative action are regarded by the Committee to be the most serious obstacle standing in the way of the development of the Merchant Marine of this country.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Similarly, the survey of the Maritime Commission in 1948 for the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments concluded that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">The fundamental weakness of the Maritime Commission, as it is now constituted, lies in its proscribed organization.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">On the basis of investigations of the Maritime Commission by two of its task forces, the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch stated:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">It is an anomaly that a regulatory commission should also conduct the executive function of managing a huge business; that executive functions should be carried on by an agency that is not subject to Presidential directions; that executive functions should be carried on by a full-time board *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the recommendations of the various studies differ in some details, they agree on principles and on the main features of reorganization.</p>
<p class="note-body">Basically, the administrative difficulties of the Maritime Commission have arisen, as all these studies agree, from the fact that the Commission is responsible for performing two fundamentally different types of functions which call for different types of organization. These two classes of functions are (a) regulatory and (b) operating and promotional. Under various acts the Commission regulates rates and services of water carriers; passes on agreements among carriers; and protects shippers against unfair and discriminatory practices. This type of activity requires the deliberation and independence of judgment which a board or commission is especially well designed to provide. But at the same time the Commission is charged with the conduct of a variety of large and costly promotional and business-type programs demanding the prompt and vigorous administration for which experience both in Government and in private enterprise has demonstrated that a single executive is essential.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Maritime Commission has charge of the construction of merchant vessels for subsidized operators and for Government account. It owns and maintains the largest merchant fleet in the world, consisting of 2,200 vessels aggregating more than 22,000,000 dead-weight tons. It charters and sells ships and, in time of war or national emergency, requisitions and operates vessels for the Government. It grants construction and operating differential subsidies to private shipping companies to maintain an active privately operated American merchant marine. It makes loans and insures mortgages to assist carriers in acquiring new vessels, and it conducts programs for training officers and seamen for the merchant marine. For the present fiscal year the performance of these functions will involve the expenditure of approximately $162,000,000 and the direction of an organization of 5,500 employees. In short, the administration of the Maritime Commission is a vast business undertaking. Moreover, the work of the Commission affects significantly the interests of both business and labor in the maintenance of a sound maritime industry.</p>
<p class="note-body">Further than this, many of the activities of the Maritime Commission are closely related to other programs of the Government and have to be coordinated with them. In the construction of a subsidized ship the Commission must cooperate with the Coast Guard on those features of design, materials, and equipment which affect the safety of the vessel and with the Navy on those which especially affect the use of the ship for national defense. Furthermore, the whole program of subsidized ship construction needs to be adjusted to the plans and requirements for national defense. At the same time the Commission's programs for the development of the merchant marine must be coordinated with our foreign policy and with Federal programs with respect to other branches of transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">While an independent commission is an appropriate instrument for the performance of the regulatory func<!-- PDFPage:80 -->tions of the Maritime Commission, such an agency obviously is not the type required to provide strong and efficient administration of the large operating programs now entrusted to the Commission or to obtain the needed coordination with other activities of the executive branch. This fact is amply demonstrated by the administrative difficulties and the complicated problems of coordination encountered in the operation of the Commission since the war and by the necessity of transferring a large part of its functions to the War Shipping Administration, headed by a single executive, during the war.</p>
<p class="note-body">Briefly, this reorganization plan provides for a small Federal Maritime Board and a Maritime Administration in the Department of Commerce to perform the functions of the Maritime Commission, and abolishes the existing Commission. It transfers to the Board the regulatory functions of the Commission and definitely guarantees the independence of the Board in the performance of these functions. In addition, it vests directly in the Board the determination and award of construction and operating differential subsidies. In the performance of its subsidy functions the Board will be subject to general policy guidance by the Secretary of Commerce. The Board, however, and it alone, will determine to whom subsidies shall be granted and will make and award the subsidy contracts. Its actions therein will be conclusive and will not be subject to modification by any other agency or officer of the Department of Commerce. The other functions of the Maritime Commission, including carrying out the subsidy agreements made by the Board and administering the various operating programs, are transferred to the Secretary of Commerce for administration through the Maritime Administration. Thus, the plan provides for each of the two types of functions now vested in the Maritime Commission the type of organization best suited to its performance. At the same time, the plan will facilitate coordination of maritime policies and programs with other related policies and programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">The division of functions under this plan conforms directly to the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government. While the award of subsidies is a promotional rather than a regulatory function and might logically be assigned to the Maritime Administration instead of the Board, its impact on the shipping industry and on individual carriers is such as to make desirable the deliberation and combined judgment of a board. Accordingly, I have adhered to the recommendation of the Commission on Organization that this function be vested in a multiple body rather than a single official. Likewise, in line with the recommendations of the Commission, the plan assigns the determination of the over-all route pattern to the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Maritime Board will consist of three members appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate for overlapping terms of 4 years. Not more than two of the members can be of the same political party. The Board, therefore, will be a smaller and more wieldy body which can function with greater expedition and efficiency than the existing five-member Commission. The Chairman will be designated by the President from the members of the Board and will be, ex officio, the Maritime Administrator and as such the head of the Maritime Administration. The plan also provides for a Deputy Maritime Administrator appointed by the Secretary of Commerce under the classified civil service. After investigation I have found, and hereby declare, that by reason of the reorganizations made by this plan, it is necessary to include in the plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the members of the Federal Maritime Board and for the appointment of the Deputy Maritime Administrator.</p>
<p class="note-body">In making the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board the Maritime Administrator, the plan adopts an arrangement substantially similar to that which prevailed during the war, when the same individual served as Chairman of the Maritime Commission and head of the War Shipping Administration. This arrangement will have important advantages. It will facilitate cooperation between the Board and the Administration on matters of concern to both. Also, it will avoid dividing the personnel of the Maritime Commission, since the Chairman of the Board will supervise the personnel assisting it in the performance of its functions, as is now the case in the Maritime Commission, and in his capacity as Administrator he will have charge of the personnel carrying on the work of the Maritime Administration. The plan provides for the joint operation of the officers and employees under the Administrator and Chairman as a single body of personnel. The maintenance of a unified staff is essential for efficient and economical administration because many of the technical and professional personnel, such as ship designers and attorneys, now assist the Maritime Commission on problems of subsidy determination and also participate in the subsequent administration of subsidy agreements and in performing nonsubsidy functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The inclusion of the new Board in the Department of Commerce will permit the use of the administrative services of the Department. More important, it will eliminate the necessity of splitting the personnel of the Maritime Commission between the Department and an outside agency. In addition, it will relieve the President of having to handle relations with a separate maritime agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In establishing the Department of Commerce the Congress provided in the organic act of the Department that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">It shall be the province and duty of said Department to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* shipping, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and the transportation facilities of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Over the years, however, transportation functions have become widely scattered throughout the executive branch. As a result, intelligent planning and budgeting of Federal transportation activities and the necessary coordination of transportation programs have become extremely difficult or impossible. The transfer of the functions of the Maritime Commission to the Department of Commerce will constitute a major step in correcting this condition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Without question the Department of Commerce is now the appropriate center for transportation programs. It contains the Civil Aeronautics Administration&mdash;the major operating and promotional agency of the Government in the field of air transportation&mdash;and the Weather Bureau, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which provide vital services to transportation. As a result of Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1949, it now also includes the Bureau of Public Roads, the leading promotional agency dealing with land transportation. Also, it has the Inland Waterways Corporation in the field of water transportation. The transfer of the functions of the Maritime Commission will bring into the Department the principal water-transportation agency of the Government. These actions will go a long way toward the establishment of a sound and effective organization for the operating and promotional programs of the Government relating to transportation.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is my purpose to look to the Secretary of Commerce for leadership with respect to transportation problems and for the development of over-all transportation policy within the executive branch. Because of the magnitude and importance of the transportation functions transferred to the Department of Commerce by this reorganization plan, I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to strengthen the top administrative structure of the Department by providing for the appointment and compensation of a new Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation. This will make available an officer of the highest rank to assist the Secretary in supervising the varied and complex transportation programs of the Department and providing central leadership in transportation matters. With the many responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce in other areas, the creation of this office is essential to enable him properly to fulfill his obligations with respect to transportation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:81 --><p class="note-body">After careful investigation I have found and I hereby declare that each of the reorganizations contained in this reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The rates of compensation fixed by the provisions of the reorganization plan for the Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation, the Chairman, and the other two members of the Federal Maritime Board are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">In summary, the reorganizations provided by this plan will have the following principal advantages: They will provide an efficient organization headed by a single responsible official to administer the large operating and business-type programs of the Maritime Commission. At the same time, they will preserve the benefits of a bipartisan board for the performance of the regulatory functions of the Commission and the determination of subsidies. They will reduce the number of agencies reporting directly to the President and simplify the over-all management of the executive branch. In doing so, they will provide more adequate machinery for supervising the administration of the maritime programs and will facilitate their coordination with related policies and programs of the executive branch. Finally, they will accomplish a major advance in the development of an effective organization of Federal transportation programs in accord with the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government. While it is impossible to estimate in advance the savings which will be brought about by this plan, the improvements in administrative efficiency resulting from it should produce substantial reductions in expenditures for the programs transferred by the plan.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission shall be the chief executive and administrative officer of the United States Maritime Commission. In executing and administering on behalf of the Commission its functions (exclusive of functions transferred by the provisions of section 2 of this reorganization plan) the Chairman shall be governed by the policies, regulatory decisions, findings, and determinations of the Commission.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1949, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan is designed to strengthen the administration of the United States Maritime Commission by making the Chairman and the chief executive and administrative officer of the Commission and vesting in him responsibility for the appointment of its personnel and the supervision and direction of their activities. After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">Unlike other major regulatory commissions, the Maritime Commission is responsible not only for the performance of important regulatory functions but also for the administration of large and complex operating and promotional programs. Whereas the budgets of most regulatory agencies amount to only a few million dollars annually, the expenditures of the Maritime Commission exceed $130,000,000 a year. As a result of the war the Commission is the owner of a fleet of over 2,300 ships, aggregating more than 23,000,000 dead-weight tons.</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is the policy of the Government, as set forth by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946, to develop and maintain an adequate and effective merchant marine under private ownership, the Commission is still confronted with the necessity of carrying on substantial programs for the charter and sale of Government-owned vessels and with the continuing task of maintaining the reserve merchant fleet.</p>
<p class="note-body">Apart from its functions with respect to the war-built fleet, the accomplishment of the Government's permanent objective with respect to the development of the American merchant marine inevitably involves the Commission to a wide variety of activities. Among these are the regulation of rates and competitive practices of water carriers, the determination of essential trade routes and services, the award of subsidies to offset differences between American and foreign costs, the design and construction of ships, the inspection of subsidized vessels, and the training of seamen.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the last 2 years the operation of the Maritime Commission has been subjected to independent examination by three bodies&mdash;the President's Advisory Committee on the Merchant Marine, the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, and the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government. All of these studies have pointed to difficulties in the conduct of the Commission's business and the necessity of improved organization to strengthen the administration of the agencies. The remedies proposed have differed in some respects, but all the studies have emphasized the need of concentrating in a single official the management of a large part of the agency's work.</p>
<p class="note-body">During the war such a concentration was temporarily accomplished by Executive order under the authority of the First War Powers Act. In effect, the Chairman of the Commission, as War Shipping Administrator, was made directly responsible for the administration of several major operating programs of the Commission. This arrangement proved its value under the stress of war. About a year after the end of the fighting, however, it was terminated and the organization reverted to the prewar pattern.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a result of postwar experience, the Commission appointed a general manager in 1948. While this has <!-- PDFPage:82 -->brought considerable improvement, it has not extricated the Commission from administration to the degree which is desirable.</p>
<p class="note-body">After careful consideration of the problems involved in improving the operation of the Maritime Commission, I have concluded that the proper action at this time is to concentrate in the Chairman the responsibility for the internal administration of the agency. This is achieved by the proposed reorganization plan by transferring to the Chairman the appointment of the personnel of the agency, except for the immediate assistants of the Commissioners, and the supervision and direction of their work. This is substantially the arrangement recommended for regulatory commissions by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">Such a plan of organization has many advantages. It leaves in the Commission as a body the performance of regulatory functions, the determination of subsidies, and the determination of major policies. Thus, it utilizes the Commission for the type of work for which such a body is best adapted. At the same time the plan places under a single official the day-to-day direction of the work of the staff within the policies and determinations adopted by the Commission in the exercise of its functions. This will provide more businesslike administration and help to overcome the delays, backlogs, and operating difficulties which have hampered the agency. At the same time by freeing the members of the Commission of much detail, the plan will enable them to concentrate on major questions of policy and program and thereby will obtain earlier and better considered resolution of the basic problems of the agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">Though the taking effect of this plan in itself may not result in substantial immediate economies, it is probable that the improved organizational arrangements will bring about, over a period of time, improved operations and substantially reduced expenditures. An itemization of these reductions, however, in advance if actual experience under the plan is not practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am convinced that this reorganization plan will contribute importantly to the more businesslike and efficient administration of the programs of the Maritime Commission.</p>

All such charters are reviewed annually by the Federal Maritime Board for the purpose of making recommendations to the Secretary of Commerce as to whether conditions exist justifying the continuance of the charters. The functions of the Secretary of Commerce with respect to the chartering of vessels has been delegated to the Maritime Administrator.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>War risk insurance</em>. Pursuant to Public Law 763, 81st Congress [46 U.S.C. 1281&ndash;1294], the Federal Maritime Board makes determinations of the fair and reasonable value of vessels insured under the provisions of Title XII of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [46 U.S.C. 1281&ndash;1294].

<p class="note-body"><em>Effective date</em>. This notice is effective March 13, 1951.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Appointment of Personnel</h4>
<p class="note-body">The following is a legal opinion, in part, dated August 29, 1950, and prepared by the General Counsel of the Maritime Administration, with respect to the authority of the chairman of the Federal Maritime Board to make appointments of personnel under the Board and the extent of the authority of the Secretary of Commerce under Reorg. Plan No. 21 of 1950, set out above, as to such personnel:</p>
<p class="note-body">Sec. 103 of Reorganization Plan 21 of 1950 [set out above] transferred to the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board &ldquo;all functions of the Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission (including his functions under the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1949 [set out above]) with respect to the functions transferred to the Board by the provisions of Sections 104 and 105&rdquo; of Plan 21. Section 104 transferred to the Board the regulatory functions of the Maritime Commission and Section 105 transferred certain of the subsidy functions of the Commission, not including, however, the function of administering subsidy contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Sec. 106 of Plan 21 provides for the status of the Board and of the Chairman and their relationship to the Secretary of Commerce. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to fully understand the intent of Plan 21, it is necessary to examine the status of the appointing authority of the Chairman of the Maritime Commission immediately prior to the transfer of functions under Plan 21. As set forth above, Section 103 of Plan 21 makes specific reference to the authority of the Chairman of the Commission under Plan 6 of 1949 as being transferred to the Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p class="note-body">Reorganization Plan 6 was transmitted by the President to Congress on June 20, 1949. Its purpose as stated in the message of transmittal [set out in Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees] was &ldquo;to strengthen the administration of the United States Maritime Commission by making the Chairman the chief executive and administrative officer of the Commission and <em>vesting in him responsibility for the appointment of its personnel</em> and the supervision and direction of their activities.&rdquo; (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of Plan 6 transferred from the Commission to the Chairman certain functions including the appointment of personnel (exclusive of &ldquo;personnel employed regularly and full time&rdquo; in the offices of other members) with the proviso that the Chairman would consult with other members before appointing the heads of major administration units. Section 1 of Plan 6 provided that in exercising certain functions the Chairman should be guided by policies of the Commission. This section significantly excepted from such requirement the authority transferred to the Chairman under Section 2 including the appointive authority. Thus the appointive authority (excluding only personnel in offices of Commission members) was exclusively and, except for the proviso relating to heads of major units, unconditionally vested in the Chairman of the Commission until Plan 21 took effect.</p>
<p class="note-body">Plan 21 transferred all the functions of the Commission and of the Chairman of the Commission. As stated above, some of these functions went to the Federal Maritime Board (Secs. 104, 105). Others were transferred to the Chairman of the Board (Sec. 103). Functions not otherwise transferred went to the Secretary of Commerce (Sec. 204).</p>
<p class="note-body">The functions transferred to the Board and to the Chairman relate to regulatory authority (to be exer<!-- PDFPage:85 -->cised independently) and subsidy functions (to be exercised subject to the guidance of general policies established by the Secretary of Commerce). As Section 103 transferring functions to the Chairman relating to these subjects makes specific reference to the authority of the Chairman of the Commission under Plan 6, which included the appointment of personnel, it appears evident that so much of the appointive power as relates to personnel performing these functions passed to the Chairman of the Board to be exercised by him independently as to personnel performing regulatory functions and subject to the injunction of Sec. 106 (to be guided by the policies of the Secretary of Commerce) as to personnel performing services in connection with the subsidy functions performed by the Board.</p>
<p class="note-body">This conclusion is reinforced by reference to a decision of the Attorney General to the Secretary of Commerce, dated May 13, 1940, construing somewhat similar provisions in a reorganization plan transferring to the Department certain functions of the Civil Aeronautics Authority [Reorg. Plan No. IV of 1940, &sect;7, eff. June 30, 1940, 5 F.R. 2421, 54 Stat. 1234, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees] *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. Despite the specific mention of the personnel functions the Attorney General held that the appointive authority was in the Board. This decision was based upon reasoning recognizing the practical fact that independence in the exercise of the functions of the Board could not be achieved if the control of personnel and finances of the Board were in the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have reached the conclusion that the appointive authority as to personnel engaged in regulatory and certain of the subsidy functions is vested in the Chairman, notwithstanding certain facts which might tend to indicate a different result.</p>
<p class="note-body">Chief among these is the statement contained in the President's message transmitting Plan 21, as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In making the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board the Maritime Administrator, the plan adopts an arrangement substantially similar to that which prevailed during the war, when the same individual served as Chairman of the Maritime Commission and head of the War Shipping Administration. This arrangement will have important advantages. It will facilitate cooperation between the Board and the Administration on matters of concern to both. Also, it will avoid dividing the personnel of the Maritime Commission, since the Chairman of the Board will supervise the personnel assisting it in the performance of its functions, as is now the case in the Maritime Commission, and in his capacity as Administrator he will have charge of the personnel carrying on the work of the Maritime Administration. The plan provides for the joint operation of the officers and employees under the Administrator and Chairman as a single body of personnel. The maintenance of a unified staff is essential for efficient and economical administration because many of the technical and professional personnel, such as ship designers and attorneys, now assist the Maritime Commission on problems of subsidy determination and also participate in the subsequent administration of subsidy agreements and in performing nonsubsidy functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The inclusion of the new Board in the Department of Commerce will permit the use of the administrative services of the Department. More important, it will eliminate the necessity of splitting the personnel of the Maritime Commission between the Department and an outside agency. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">A literal reading of portions of this statement might be used as a basis for argument that a single appointive authority was intended. This meaning cannot be given the statement, however, in view of the specific language of the Plan as previously discussed. It is more likely that the President had in mind the fact that the Plan seems to contemplate a delegation of authority from the Secretary to the Chairman-Administrator by providing in Sec. 204 that &ldquo;The Secretary of Commerce may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by the Maritime Administrator of any function transferred to such Secretary by the provisions of this reorganization plan.&rdquo; Sec. 302 provides that the Chairman-Administrator shall make joint use of personnel.</p>
<p class="note-body">Another argument against the conclusion stated could be based upon the fact that Plan 21 makes specific reference in transferring functions to the Board of certain titles and portions of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended [this chapter], without making any reference to Sec. 201(e) of that Act [subsec. (e) of this section] which is the source of the appointive authority formerly vested in the Commission. This argument fails, however, when consideration is given to the fact that immediately prior to Plan 21 this authority was vested not in the Commission but in the Chairman of the Commission under Plan 6 and is included in the specific reference to Plan 6.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is clear that both Plan 21 and the President's transmittal message contemplate the use of personnel to perform dual functions for the Board and for the Administrator. It is equally clear that the Plan itself does not contain provisions vesting in a <em>single appointive authority</em> the power to establish such a group of personnel. It is evident, therefore, that the President contemplated that this objective be achieved by the Chairman's voluntarily utilizing the services of employees appointed under the authority of the Secretary to perform services in connection with Board functions and, in his capacity as Administrator, utilizing the services of employees employed by him under the direct grant of authority in the Plan to perform duties assigned to him by the Secretary. Thus the Plan, although directing the joint use of personnel, intends that result to be accomplished through the use of the administrative discretion granted the Chairman-Administrator by Section 302 of the Plan to be exercised in the interest of economy and efficiency, and does not vest exclusive appointing authority either in the Secretary or the Chairman-Administrator.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Secretary of Transportation to make a survey of the American merchant marine, as it now exists, to determine what additions and replacements are required to carry forward the national policy declared in section 1101 of this Appendix, and the Secretary of Transportation is directed to study, perfect, and adopt a long-range program for replacements and additions to the American merchant marine so that as soon as practicable the following objectives may be accomplished:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">First, the creation of an adequate and well-balanced merchant fleet, including vessels of all types, to provide shipping service essential for maintaining the flow of the foreign commerce of the United States, the vessels in such fleet to be so designed as to be readily and quickly convertible into transport and supply vessels in a time of national emergency. In planning the development of such a fleet the Secretary of Transportation is directed to cooperate closely with the Navy Department as to national-defense needs and the possible speedy adaptation of the merchant fleet to national-defense requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Second, the ownership and the operation of such a merchant fleet by citizens of the United States insofar as may be practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Third, the planning of vessels designed to afford the best and most complete protection for passengers and crew against fire and all marine perils.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fourth, the creation and maintenance of efficient shipbuilding and repair capacity in the United States with adequate numbers of skilled personnel to provide an adequate mobilization base.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application for subsidy for construction; conditions precedent to granting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any proposed ship purchaser who is a citizen of the United States or any shipyard of the United States may make application to the Secretary of Transportation for a construction-differential subsidy to aid in the construction of a new vessel to be used in the foreign commerce of the United States. No such application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines that (1) the plans and specifications call for a new vessel which will meet the requirements of the foreign commerce of the United States, will aid in the promotion and development of such commerce, and be suitable for use by the United States for national defense or military purposes in time of war or national emergency; (2) if the applicant is the proposed ship purchaser, the applicant possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the operation and maintenance of the proposed new vessel, and (3) the granting of the aid applied for is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this chapter. The contract of sale, and the mortgage given to secure the payment of the unpaid balance of the purchase price shall not restrict the lawful or proper use or operation of the vessel except to the extent expressly required by law. The Secretary of Transportation may give preferred consideration to applications that will tend to reduce construction-differential subsidies and that propose the construction of ships of higher transport capability and productivity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission of plans to Navy Department; certification of approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation shall submit the plans and specifications for the proposed vessel to the Navy Department for examination thereof and suggestions for such changes therein as may be deemed necessary or proper in order that such vessel shall be suitable for economical and speedy conversion into a naval or military auxiliary, or otherwise suitable for the use of the United States Government in time of war or national emergency. If the Secretary of the Navy approves such plans and specifications as submitted, or as modified, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, he shall certify such approval to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application for subsidy for reconstruction or reconditioning; conditions precedent to granting; contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any citizen of the United States or any shipyard of the United States may make application to the Secretary of Transportation for a construction-differential subsidy to aid in reconstructing or reconditioning any vessel that is to be used in the foreign commerce of the United States. If the Secretary of Transportation, in the exercise of his discretion, shall determine that the granting of the financial aid applied for is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this chapter, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such application and enter into a contract or contracts with the applicant therefor providing for the payment by the United States of a construction-differential subsidy that is to be ascertained, determined, controlled, granted, and paid, subject to all the applicable conditions and limitations of this subchapter and under such further conditions and limitations as may be prescribed in the rules and regulations of the Secretary of Transportation has adopted as provided in section 1114(b) of this Appendix; but the financial aid authorized by this subsection shall be extended to reconstruction or reconditioning only in exceptional cases and after a thorough study and a formal determination by the Secretary of Transportation that the proposed reconstruction or reconditioning is consistent with the purposes and policy of this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1152. Construction of vessels; bids; subsidies</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Approval of bids; contract with bidder; acceptance of negotiated price; shipyard records, availability; contract with applicant or qualified citizen for purchase of vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of the Navy certifies his approval under section 1151(b) of this Appendix, and the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may secure bids for the construction of the proposed vessel according to the approved plans and specifications. If the bid of the shipbuilder who is the lowest responsible bidder is determined by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable, the Secretary of Transportation may approve such bid, and if such approved bid is accepted by the proposed ship purchaser, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract with the successful bidder for the construction, outfitting, and equipment of the proposed vessel, and for the payment by the Secretary of Transportation to the shipbuilder, on terms to be agreed upon in the contract, of the contract price of the vessel, out of the construction fund hereinbefore referred to, or out of other available funds. Notwithstanding the provisions of the first sentence of section 1155 of this Appendix with respect to competitive bidding, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to accept a price for the construction of the ship which has been negotiated between a shipyard and proposed ship purchaser if (1) the proposed ship purchaser and the shipyard submit backup cost details and evidence that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; (2) the Secretary of Transportation finds that the negotiated price is fair and reasonable; and (3) the shipyard agrees that the Comptroller General of the United States or any of his duly authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of three years after final payment have access to and the right to examine any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the shipyard or any of its subcontractors related to the negotiation or performance of any contract or subcontract negotiated under this subsection and will include in its subcontracts a provision to that effect. Concurrently with entering into such contract with the shipbuilder, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to enter into a contract for the sale of such vessel upon its completion, to the applicant if he is the proposed ship purchaser and if not to another citizen of the United States, if the Secretary of Transportation determines that such citizen possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary for the operation and maintenance of the vessel at a price corresponding to the estimated cost, as determined by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, of building such vessel in a foreign shipyard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Basis for fixing subsidy; cost of construction in foreign yards; annual recomputation and publication of foreign cost; limitation on construction differential; report on American shipbuilding industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of reduction in selling price which is herein termed &ldquo;construction differential subsidy&rdquo; shall equal, but not exceed, the excess of the bid of the shipbuilder constructing the proposed vessel (excluding the cost of any features incorporated in the vessel for national defense uses, which shall be paid by the Secretary in addition to the subsidy), over the fair and reasonable estimate of cost, as determined by the Secretary, of the construction of that type vessel if it were constructed under similar plans and specifications (excluding national defense features as above provided) in a foreign shipbuilding center which is deemed by the Secretary to furnish a fair and representative example for the determination of the estimated foreign cost of construction of vessels of the type proposed to be constructed. The Secretary of Transportation shall recompute such estimated foreign cost annually unless, in the opinion of the Secretary, there has been a significant change in shipbuilding market conditions. The Secretary shall publish notice of his intention to compute or recompute such estimated foreign cost and shall give interested persons, including but not limited to shipyards and shipowners and associations thereof, an opportunity to file written statements. The Secretary's consideration shall include, but not be limited to, all relevant matter so filed, and his determination shall include or be accompanied by a concise explanation of the basis of his determination. The construction differential approved and paid by the Secretary shall not exceed 50 per centum of the cost of constructing, reconstructing, or reconditioning the vessel (excluding the cost of national defense features). If the Secretary finds that the construction differential exceeds, in any case, the foregoing percentage of such cost, the Secretary may negotiate with any bidder (whether or not such person is the lowest bidder) and may contract with such bidder (notwithstanding the first sentence of section 1155 of this Appendix) for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of the vessel involved in a domestic shipyard at a cost which will reduce the construction differential to such percentage or less. In the event that the Secretary has reason to believe that the bidding in any instance is collusive, he shall report all of the evidence on which he acted (1) to the Attorney General of the United States, and (2) to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of Representatives if the Congress shall be in session or if the Congress shall not be in session, then to the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms of sale of vessel to purchaser</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In such contract of sale between the purchaser and the Secretary of Transportation, the purchaser shall be required to make cash payments to the Secretary of Transportation of not less than 25 per centum of the price at which the vessel is sold to the purchaser. The cash payments shall be made at the time and in the same pro<!-- PDFPage:101 -->portion as provided for the payments on account of the construction cost in the contract between the shipbuilder and the Secretary of Transportation. The purchaser shall pay, not less frequently than annually, interest on those portions of the Secretary of Transportation's payments as made to the shipbuilder which are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel (after deduction of the purchaser's cash payments) at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs. The balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser, within twenty-five years after delivery of the vessel and in not to exceed twenty-five equal annual installments, the first of which shall be payable one year after the delivery of the vessel by the Secretary of Transportation to the purchaser. Interest at the rate per annum applicable to payments that are chargeable to the purchaser's portion of the price of the vessel shall be paid on all such installments of the purchase price remaining unpaid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 87&ndash;877, &sect;2(a), Oct. 24, 1962, 76 Stat. 1200</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Construction in navy yards; sales to citizens; terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If no bids are received for the construction, outfitting, or equipping of such vessel, or if it appears to the Secretary of Transportation that the bids received from privately owned shipyards of the United States are collusive, excessive, or unreasonable, and if a citizen of the United States agrees to purchase said vessel as provided in this section, then, to provide employment for citizens of the United States, the Secretary of Transportation may have such vessel constructed, outfitted, or equipped at not in excess of the actual cost thereof in a navy yard of the United States under such regulations as may be promulgated by the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of Transportation. In such event the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to pay for any such vessel so constructed from his construction fund. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell any vessel so constructed, outfitted, or equipped in a navy yard to a citizen of the United States for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof less the equivalent to the construction differential subsidy determined as provided by subsection (b) of this section, such sale to be in accordance with all the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Survey of shipbuilding capability; correction of inadequacies; reimbursement of certain vessel construction and delivery expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation, with the advice of and in coordination with the Secretary of the Navy, shall at least once each year, as required for purposes of this chapter, survey the existing privately owned shipyards capable of merchant ship construction, or review available data on such shipyards if deemed adequate, to determine whether their capabilities for merchant ship construction, including facilities and skilled personnel, provide an adequate mobilization base at strategic points for purposes of national defense and national emergency. The Secretary of Transportation, in connection with ship construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling under this subchapter and subchapter VII of this chapter, upon a basis of a finding that the award of the proposed construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling work will remedy an existing or impending inadequacy in such mobilization base as to the capabilities and capacities of a shipyard or shipyards at a strategic point, and after taking into consideration the benefits accruing from standardized construction, the conditions of unemployment, and the needs and reasonable requirements of all shipyards, may allocate such construction, reconstruction, reconditioning, or remodeling to such yard or yards in such manner as he may determine to be fair, just, and reasonable to all sections of the country, subject to the provisions of this subsection. In the allocation of construction work to such yards as herein provided, the Secretary of Transportation may, after first obtaining competitive bids for such work in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, negotiate with the bidders and with other shipbuilders concerning the terms and conditions of any contract for such work, and is authorized to enter into such contract at a price deemed by the Secretary of Transportation to be fair and reasonable. Any contract entered into by the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of this subsection shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this chapter, excepting those pertaining to the awarding of contracts to the lowest bidder which are inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection. In the event that a contract is made providing for a price in excess of the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted, such excess shall be paid by the Secretary of Transportation as a part of the cost of national defense, and shall not be considered as a part of the construction-differential subsidy. In the event that a contract is made providing for a price lower than the lowest responsible bid which otherwise would be accepted, the construction-differential subsidy shall be computed on the contract price in lieu of such bid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If, as a result of allocation under this subsection, the purchaser incurs expenses for inspection and supervision of the vessel during construction and for the delivery voyage of the vessel in excess of the estimated expenses for the same services that he would have incurred if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder the Secretary of Transportation (with respect to construction under this subchapter, except section 1159 of this Appendix) shall reimburse the purchaser for such excess, less one-half of any gross income the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income, and such reimbursement shall not be considered part of the con<!-- PDFPage:102 -->struction-differential subsidy: <em>Provided</em>, That no interest shall be paid on any refund authorized under this chapter. If the vessel is constructed under section 1159 of this Appendix the Secretary of Transportation shall reduce the price of the vessel by such excess, less one-half of any gross income (minus one-half of the extra expenses incurred to produce such gross income) the purchaser receives that is allocable to the delivery voyage. In the case of a vessel that is not to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated at the port where the vessel begins loading. In the case of a vessel that is to receive operating-differential subsidy, the delivery voyage shall be deemed terminated when the vessel begins loading at a United States port in an essential service. In either case, however, the vessel owner shall not be compensated for excess vessel delivery costs in an amount greater than the expenses that would have been incurred in delivering the vessel from the shipyard at which it was built to the shipyard of the lowest responsible bidder. If as a result of such allocation, the expenses the purchaser incurs with respect to such services are less than the expenses he would have incurred for such services if the vessel had been constructed by the lowest responsible bidder, the purchaser shall pay to the Secretary of Transportation an amount equal to such reduction and, if the vessel was built with the aid of construction-differential subsidy, such payment shall not be considered a reduction of the construction-differential subsidy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sale of vessels acquired by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the application of any citizen of the United States to purchase any vessel acquired by the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of section 1125 of this Appendix, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to sell such vessel to the applicant for the fair and reasonable value thereof, but at not less than the cost thereof to the Secretary of Transportation less depreciation at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from the date of completion, excluding the cost of national-defense features added by the Secretary of Transportation, less the equivalent of any applicable construction-differential subsidy as provided by subsection (b) of this section, such sale to be in accordance with all the provisions of this subchapter. Such vessel shall thereupon be eligible for an operating-differential subsidy under subchapter VI of this chapter, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1171(a)(1), and section 1180(1) of this Appendix, or any other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Installation or removal of national defense features; title to such features</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to construct, purchase, lease, acquire, store, maintain, sell, or otherwise dispose of national defense features intended for installation on vessels. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to install or remove such national defense features on any vessel (1) which is in the National Defense Reserve Fleet as defined by section 1744(a) of the Appendix to title 50, (2) which is requisitioned, purchased, or chartered under section 1242 of this Appendix, (3) which serves as security for the guarantee of an obligation by the Secretary of Transportation under subchapter XI of this chapter, or (4) which is the subject of an agreement between the owner of such vessel and the Secretary of Transportation to install or remove such national defense features. Title to such national defense features which the Secretary of Transportation determines are not to be permanently incorporated in a vessel shall not be affected by such installation or removal unless otherwise transferred in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Plans, specifications, and proposals for national defense features; certification of approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation shall submit the plans and specifications for such national defense features and the proposals for their acquisition, storage, utilization, or disposition to the Navy Department for examination thereof and suggestion for such changes therein as may be deemed necessary or proper in order that such features shall be suitable for the use of the United States Government in time of war or national emergency. If the Secretary of the Navy approves such plans, specifications, or proposals as submitted, or as modified in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, he shall certify such approval to the Secretary of Transportation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Reversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall include in any conveyance under this subsection terms under which all right, title, and interest conveyed by the Secretary shall revert to the United States if the Secretary determines the vessel has been used other than as described in the business plan required under paragraph (1)(E).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Any citizen of the United States may make application to the Secretary of Transportation for aid in the construction of a new vessel to be operated in the foreign or domestic trade (excepting vessels engaged solely in the transportation of property on inland rivers and canals exclusively). If such application is approved by the Secretary of Transportation, the vessel may be constructed under the terms and conditions of this subchapter, but no construction-differential subsidy shall be allowed. The Secretary of Transportation shall pay for the cost of national-defense features incorporated in such vessel. In case the vessel is designed to be of not less than three thousand five hundred gross tons and to be capable of sustained speed of not less than ten knots, or in the case of a passenger vessel operating solely on the inland rivers and waterways which is designed to be of not less than one thousand gross tons and to be capable of sustained speed of not less than eight knots, or in the case of a ferry operating solely in point-to-point transportation which is designed to be of not less than seventy-five gross tons and to be capable of a sustained speed of not less than eight knots, in the case of an oceangoing tug of more than two thousand five hundred horsepower or oceangoing barge of more than two thousand five hundred gross tons, or in the case of a vessel of more than two thousand five hundred horsepower designed to be capable of sustained speed of not less than forty knots, the purchaser shall be required to pay the Secretary of Transportation not less than 121/2 per centum of the cost of such vessel, and in the case of any other vessel the purchaser shall be required to pay the Secretary of Transportation not less than 25 per centum of the cost of such vessel (excluding from such cost, in either case, the cost of national defense features); and the balance of such purchase price shall be paid by the purchaser within twenty-five years in not to exceed twenty-five equal annual installments, with interest at a rate not less than (i) a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus (ii) an allowance adequate in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation to cover administrative costs, the balance of such purchase price being secured by a preferred mortgage on the vessel sold and otherwise secured as the Secretary of Transportation may determine: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, the balance of the purchase price of a passenger vessel constructed under this section which is delivered subsequent to March 8, 1946, and which has the tonnage, speed, passenger accommodations, and other characteristics set forth in section 1153 of this Appendix, may, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, be secured as provided in such section, and the obligation of the purchaser of such a vessel shall be satisfied and discharged as provided in such section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1160. Acquisition of obsolete vessels</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;obsolete vessel&rdquo; means a vessel or vessels, each of which (A) is of not less than one thousand three hundred and fifty gross tons, (B) in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation, should, by reason of age, obsolescence, or otherwise, be replaced in the public interest and (C) has been owned by a citizen or citizens of the United States for at least three years immediately prior to the date of acquisition hereunder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;new vessel&rdquo; means a vessel or vessels, each of which (A) is constructed under the provisions of this chapter, and is acquired within two years from the date of completion of such vessel, or is purchased under section 1204 of this Appendix, as amended, by the person turning in an obsolete vessel under this section, or (B) is hereafter constructed in a domestic shipyard on private account and not under the provisions of this chapter, and documented under the laws of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Promotion of construction of new vessels; allowance on obsolete vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to promote the construction of new, safe, and efficient vessels to carry the domestic and foreign waterborne commerce of the United States, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized, subject to the provisions of this section, to acquire any obsolete vessel in exchange for an allowance of credit. The obsolete vessel shall be acquired by the Secretary of Transportation, if the owner so requests, either at the time the owner contracts for the construction or purchase of a new vessel or within five days of the actual date of delivery of the new vessel to the owner. The amount of the allowance shall be determined at the time of the acquisition of the obsolete vessel by the Secretary of Transportation. In the event the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Secretary of Transportation at the time the owner contracts for the construction or purchase of the new vessel, the allowance shall not be paid to the owner of the obsolete vessel, but shall be applied upon the purchase price of a new vessel. In the case of a new vessel constructed under the provisions of this chapter, such allowance may, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Transportation may prescribe, be applied upon the cash payments required under this chapter. In case the new vessel is not constructed under the provisions of this chapter, the allowance shall, upon acquisition of the obsolete vessel by the Secretary of Transportation, be paid, for the account of the owner, to the shipbuilder constructing such new vessel. In the event that title to the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Secretary of Transportation at the time of delivery of the new vessel, the allowance shall be deposited in the owner's capital construction fund. This subsection shall apply to obsolete vessels exchanged for new vessels hereafter contracted to be built, or eligible for such exchange but not exchanged in connection with a contract for new vessels executed prior to October 1, 1960.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Utility value of new vessel; gross tonnage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The utility value of the new vessel for operation in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States shall not be substantially less than that of the obsolete vessel. The gross tonnage of the obsolete vessel may exceed the gross tonnage of the new vessel in a ratio not in excess of three to one, if the Secretary of Transportation finds that the new vessel, although of lesser tonnage, will provide utility value equivalent to or greater than that of the obsolete vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of allowance on obsolete vessel; determination of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The allowance for an obsolete vessel shall be the fair and reasonable value of such vessel as determined by the Secretary of Transportation. In making such determination the Secretary of Transportation shall consider: (1) the scrap value of the obsolete vessel both in American and foreign markets, (2) the depreciated value based on a twenty or twenty-five year life, whichever is applicable to the obsolete vessel, and (3) the market value thereof for operation in the world trade or in the foreign or domestic trade of the United States. In the event the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Secretary of Transportation at the time the owner contracts for the construction of the new vessel, and the owner uses such vessel during the period of con<!-- PDFPage:112 -->struction of the new vessel, the allowance shall be reduced by an amount representing the fair value of such use. The rate for the use of the obsolete vessel shall be fixed by the Secretary of Transportation for the entire period of such use at the time of execution of the contract for the construction of the new vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Recognition of gain for income tax purposes; basis for gain or loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No gain shall be recognized to the owner for the purpose of Federal income taxes in the case of a transfer of an obsolete vessel to the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of this section. The basis for gain or loss upon a sale or exchange and for depreciation under the applicable Federal income-tax laws of a new vessel acquired as contemplated in this section shall be the same as the basis of the obsolete vessel or vessels exchanged for credit upon the acquisition of such new vessel, increased in the amount of the cost of such vessel (other than the cost represented by such obsolete vessel or vessels) and decreased in the amount of loss recognized upon such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation shall include in his annual report to Congress a detailed statement of all transactions consummated under the provisions of the preceding subsections during the period covered by such report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of vessels 25 years old or more</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An obsolete vessel acquired by the Secretary of Transportation under this section which is or becomes twenty-five years old or more, and vessels presently in the Secretary's laid-up fleet which are or become twenty-five years old or more, shall in no case be used for commercial operation, except that any such obsolete vessel, or any such vessel in the laid-up fleet may be used during any period in which vessels may be requisitioned under section 1242 of this Appendix, as amended, and except as otherwise provided in this chapter for the employment of the Secretary's vessels in steamship lines on trade routes exclusively serving the foreign trade of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;225, title III, &sect;307(7), Dec. 12, 1989, 103 Stat. 1925</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Exchange of vessels; valuation; scrapping of traded out vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to acquire suitable documented vessels, as defined in section 2101 of title 46, with funds in the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund derived from the sale of obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. For purposes of this subsection, the acquired and obsolete vessels shall be valued at their scrap value in domestic or foreign markets as of the date of the acquisition for or sale from the National Defense Reserve Fleet; except that, in a transaction subject to this section, the value assigned to those vessels will be determined on the same basis, with consideration given to the fair value of the cost of positioning the traded-out vessel to the place of scrapping. All costs incident to the lay-up of the vessel acquired under this subsection may be paid from balances in the Fund. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 808 and 835 of this Appendix, vessels sold from the National Defense Reserve Fleet under this subsection may be scrapped in approved foreign markets.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Placement in national defense reserve fleet of acquired vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any vessel heretofore or hereafter acquired under this section, or otherwise acquired by the Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation under any other authority shall be placed in the national defense reserve fleet established under authority of section 11 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 [50 App. U.S.C. 1744] and shall not be traded out or sold from such reserve fleet, except as provided for in subsections (g) and (i) of this section. This limitation shall not affect the rights of the Secretary of Transportation to dispose of a vessel as provided in other sections of this subchapter or in subchapters VII or XI of this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body"><b>1990</b>&mdash;Subsec. (i). Pub. L. 101&ndash;595 amended subsec. (i) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec.

For purposes of this subsection, the trade-in and trade-out vessels shall be valued at the higher of their scrap value in domestic or foreign markets as of the date of the exchange: <em>Provided</em>, That in any exchange transactions, the value assigned to the traded-in and traded-out vessels will be determined on the same basis. The value of the traded-out vessels shall be as nearly as possible equal to the value of the traded-in vessel plus the fair value of the cost of towing the traded-out vessel to the place of scrapping. To the extent the value of the traded-out vessel exceeds the value of the traded-in vessel plus the fair value of the cost of towing, the owner of the traded-in vessel shall pay the excess to the Secretary of Transportation in cash at the time of exchange. This excess shall be deposited into the Vessel Operations Revolving Fund and all costs incident to the lay-up of the vessels acquired under this chapter may be paid from balances in the Fund. No payments shall be made by the Secretary of Transportation to the owner of any traded-in vessel in connection with any exchange under <!-- PDFPage:113 -->this subsection.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application for subsidy; conditions precedent to granting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and directed to consider the application of any citizen of the United States for financial aid in the operation of a vessel or vessels, which are to be used in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States or in such service and in cruises authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix. In this subchapter VI the term &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; means the operation of a vessel on a service, route, or line described in section 1121(a) of this Appendix or in bulk cargo carrying service described in section 1121(b) of this Appendix. No such application shall be approved by the Secretary of Transportation unless he determines that (1) the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service is required to meet foreign-flag competition and to promote the foreign commerce of the United States except to the extent such vessels are to be operated on cruises authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix, and that such vessel or vessels were built in the United States, or have been documented under the laws of the United States not later than February 1, 1928, or actually ordered and under construction for the account of citizens of the United States prior to such date; (2) the applicant owns, or leases or can and will build or purchase, or lease, a vessel or vessels of the size, type, speed, and number, and with the proper equipment required to enable him to operate in an essential service, in such manner as may be necessary to meet competitive conditions, and to promote foreign commerce; (3) the applicant possesses the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to enable him to conduct the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels as to meet competitive conditions and promote foreign commerce; (4) the granting of the aid applied for is necessary to place the proposed operations of the vessel or vessels on a parity with those of foreign competitors, and is reasonably calculated to carry out effectively the purposes and policy of this chapter. To the extent the application covers cruises, as authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix, the Secretary of Transportation may make the portion of this last determination relating to parity on the basis that any foreign flag cruise from the United States competes with any American flag cruise from the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statements as to financial interests to accompany application; penalty for false statements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every application for an operating-differential subsidy under the provisions of this subchapter shall be accompanied by statements disclosing the names of all persons having any pecuniary interest, direct or indirect, in such application, or in the ownership or use of the vessel or vessels, routes, or lines covered thereby, and the nature and extent of any such interest, together with such financial and other statements as may be required by the Secretary of Transportation. All such statements shall be under oath or affirmation and in such form as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe. Any person who, in an application for financial aid under this subchapter or in any statement required to be filed therewith, willfully makes any untrue statement of a material fact, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1173. Contracts for payment of subsidy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization of contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of Transportation approves the application, he may enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of an operating-differential subsidy determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, for the operation of such vessel or vessels in an essential service and in cruises authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix for a period not exceeding twenty years, and subject to such reasonable terms and conditions, consistent with this chapter, as the Secretary of Transportation shall require to effectuate the purposes and policy of this chapter, including a performance bond with approved sureties, if such bond is required by the Secretary of Transportation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such contract shall provide, except as the parties should agree upon a lesser amount, that the amount of the operating-differential subsidy for the operation of vessels in an essential service shall equal the excess of the subsidizable wage costs of the United States officers and crews, the fair and reasonable cost of insurance, subsistence of officers and crews on passenger vessels, as defined in section 1183 of this Appendix, maintenance, and repairs not compensated by insurance, incurred in the operation under United States registry of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract, over the estimated fair and reasonable cost of the same items of expense (after deducting therefrom any estimated increase in such items necessitated by features incorporated pursuant to the provisions of section 1151(b) of this Appendix) if such vessel or vessels were operated under the registry of a foreign country whose vessels are substantial competitors of the vessel or vessels covered by the contract: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary of Transportation may, with respect to any vessel in an essential bulk cargo carrying service as described in section 1121(b) of this Appendix, pay, in lieu of the operating-differential subsidy provided by this subsection (b), such sums as he shall determine to be necessary to make the cost of operating such vessel competitive with the cost of operating similar vessels under the registry of a foreign country. For any period during which a vessel cruises as authorized by section 1183 of this Appendix, operating-differential subsidy shall be computed as though the vessel were operating on the essential service to which the vessel is assigned: <em>Provided, however</em>, That if the cruise vessel calls at a port or ports outside of its assigned service, but which is served with passenger vessels (as defined in section 1183 of this Appendix) by another subsidized operator at an operating-differential subsidy rate for wages lower than the cruise vessel has on its assigned essential service, the operating-differential subsidy rates for each of the subsidizable items for each day (a fraction of a day to count as a day) that the vessel stops at such port shall be at the respective rates applicable to the subsidized operator regularly serving the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Collective bargaining costs&rdquo;, &ldquo;base period costs&rdquo;, &ldquo;base period&rdquo;, and &ldquo;subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews&rdquo; defined; determination of collective bargaining costs and establishment of new base periods; wage change index</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When used in this section&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:120 --><p class="statutory-body">(A) The term &ldquo;collective bargaining costs&rdquo; means the annual cost, calculated on the basis of the per diem rate of expense as of any date, of all items of expense required of the applicant through collective bargaining or other agreement, covering the employ of United States officers and crew of a vessel, including payments required by law to assure old-age pensions, unemployment benefits, or similar benefits and taxes or other governmental assessments on crew payrolls, but excluding subsistence of officers and crews on vessels other than passenger vessels as defined in section 1183 of this Appendix and costs relating to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to the award of a contract for the construction or reconstruction of a vessel, to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary of Transportation shall afford representatives of the collective-bargaining unit or units responsible for the manning of the vessel an opportunity to comment on such finding prior to the effective date of such finding: <em>And provided further</em>, That in determining whether officers or members of the crew are necessary for the efficient and economical operation of such vessel, the Secretary of Transportation shall give due consideration to, but shall not be bound by, wage and manning scales and working conditions required by a bona fide collective-bargaining agreement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) those officers or members of the crew that the Secretary of Transportation has found, prior to ninety days following October 21, 1970, to be unnecessary for the efficient and economical operation of the vessel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The term &ldquo;base period costs&rdquo; means for the base period beginning July 1, 1970, and ending June 30, 1971, the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1, 1971, less all other items of cost that have been disallowed by the Secretary of Transportation prior to ninety days following October 21, 1970, and not already excluded from collective-bargaining costs under subparagraph (A)(i) or (A)(ii) of this subsection. In any subsequent base period the term &ldquo;base period costs&rdquo; means the average of the subsidizable wage cost of United States officers and crews for the preceding annual period ending June 30 (calculated without regard to the limitation of the last sentence of paragraph (D) of this subdivision but increased or decreased by the increase or decrease in the index described in subdivision (3) of this subsection from January 1 of such annual period to January 1 of the base period), and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of the base period: <em>Provided</em>, That in no event shall the base period cost be such that the difference between the base period cost and the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of any base period subsequent to the first base period exceeds five-fourths of 1 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of such January 1 multiplied by the number of years that have elapsed since the most recent base period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The term &ldquo;base period&rdquo; means any annual period beginning July 1, and ending June 30 with respect to which a base period cost is established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The term &ldquo;subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews&rdquo; in any period other than a base period means the most recent base period costs increased or decreased by the increase or decrease from January 1 of such base period to January 1 of such period in the index described in subdivision (3) hereof, and with respect to a base period means the base period cost. The subsidizable wage costs of United States officers and crews in any period other than a base period shall not be less than 90 per centum of the collective-bargaining costs as of January 1 of such period nor greater than 110 per centum of such collective-bargaining costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the collective-bargaining costs on ships in subsidized operation as of January 1, 1971, and as of each January 1 thereafter, and shall as of intervals of not less than two years nor more than four years, establish a new base period cost, except that the Secretary shall not establish a new base period unless he announces his intention to do so prior to the December 31 that would be included in the new base period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics shall compile the index referred to in subdivision (1). Such index shall consist of the average annual change in wages and benefits placed into effect for employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements with equal weight to be given to changes affecting employees in the transportation industry (excluding the offshore maritime industry) and to changes affecting employees in private nonagricultural industries other than transportation. Such index shall be based on the materials regularly used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in compiling its regularly published statistical series on wage and benefit changes arrived at through collective bargaining. Such materials shall remain confidential and not be subject to disclosure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Foreign wage computation; foreign manning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each foreign wage cost computation shall be made after an opportunity is given to the contractor to submit in writing and in timely fashion all relevant data within his possession. In making the computation, the Secretary shall consider all relevant matter so presented and all foreign wage cost data collected at his request or on his behalf. Such foreign cost data shall be made available to an interested contractor, unless the Secretary shall find that disclosure of the data will prevent him from obtaining such data in the future. In determining foreign manning for purposes of this section, the foreign manning determined for any ship type with respect to any base period shall not be redetermined until the beginning of a new base period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Monthly payment of wage subsidy; procedures for calculation and payment of subsidy on certain expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The wage subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month, upon the contractor's certification that the subsidized vessels were in authorized service during the month. The Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe procedures for the calculation and payment of subsidy on items of expense which are included in &ldquo;collective-bargaining costs&rdquo; but are not included in the daily rate because they are unpredictably timed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:121 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Monthly percentage payment of other than wage subsidy; security for refund of overpayments; payment of remainder after audit of voyage accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Ninety percent of the amount of the insurance and maintenance and repair and subsistence of officers and crews subsidy shall be payable monthly for the voyages completed during the month on the basis of the subsidy estimated to have accrued with respect to such voyages. Any such payment shall be made only after there has been furnished to the Secretary of Transportation such security as he deems to be reasonable and necessary to assure refund of any overpayment. The contractor and the Secretary of Transportation shall audit the voyage accounts as soon as practicable after such payment. The remaining 10 percent of such subsidy shall be payable after such audit.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Vessels engaged in coastwise or intercoastal trade; vessels on inland waterways</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of any vessel on a voyage on which it engages in coastwise or intercoastal trade: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such subsidy may be paid on a round-the-world voyage or a round voyage from the west coast of the United States to a European port or ports or a round voyage from the Atlantic coast to the Orient which includes intercoastal ports of the United States or a voyage in foreign trade on which the vessel may stop at the State of Hawaii, or an island possession or island territory of the United States, and if the subsidized vessel earns any gross revenue on the carriage of mail, passengers, or cargo by reason of such coastal or intercoastal trade the subsidy payment for the entire voyage shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the subsidy otherwise payable as such gross revenue bears to the gross revenue derived from the entire voyage. No vessel operating on the inland waterways of the United States shall be considered for the purposes of this chapter to be operating in foreign trade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Vessels more than 25 years old</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No operating-differential subsidy shall be paid for the operation of a vessel after the calendar year the vessel becomes 25 years of age, unless the Secretary of Transportation has determined, before October 8, 1996, that it is in the public interest to grant such financial aid for the operation of such vessel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No contract shall be made under this subchapter with respect to a vessel to be operated in an essential service served by citizens of the United States which would be in addition to the existing service, or services, unless the Secretary of Transportation shall determine after proper hearing of all parties that the service already provided by vessels of United States registry is inadequate, and that in the accomplishment of the purposes and policy of this chapter additional vessels should be operated thereon; and no contract shall be made with respect to a vessel operated or to be operated in an essential service served by two or more citizens of the United States with vessels of United States registry, if the Secretary of Transportation shall determine the effect of such a contract would be to give undue advantage or be unduly prejudicial, as between citizens of the United States, in the operation of vessels in such essential service unless following public hearing, due notice of which shall be given to each operator serving such essential service, the Secretary of Transportation shall find that it is necessary to enter into such contract in order to provide adequate service by vessels of United States registry. The Secretary of Transportation in determining for the purposes of this section whether services are competitive, shall take into consideration the type, size, and speed of the vessels employed, whether passenger or cargo, or combination passenger and cargo, vessels, the ports or ranges between which they run, the character of cargo carried, and such other facts as he may deem proper.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for an operating-differential subsidy under this subchapter shall provide (1) that the amount of the future payments to the contractor shall be subject to review and readjustment from time to time, but not more frequently than once a year, at the instance of the Secretary of Transportation or of the contractor. If any such readjustment cannot be reached by mutual agreement, the Secretary of Transportation, on his own motion or on the application of the contractor, shall, after a proper hearing, determine the facts and make such readjustment in the amount of such future payments as he may determine to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest. The testimony in every such proceeding shall be reduced to writing and filed in the office of the Secretary of Transportation. His decision shall be based upon and governed by the changes which may have occurred since the date of the said contract, with respect to the items theretofore considered and on which such contract was based, and other conditions affecting shipping, and shall be promulgated in a formal order, which shall be accompanied by a report in writing in which the Secretary of Transportation shall state his findings of fact; (2) that the compensation to be paid under it shall be reduced, under such terms and in such amounts as the Secretary of Transportation shall determine, for any periods in which the vessel or vessels are laid up; (3) that if the Secretary of Transportation shall determine that a change in an essential service, which is receiving an operating-differential subsidy under this subchapter, is necessary in the accomplishment of the purposes of this chapter, it may make such change upon such readjustment of payments to the contractor as shall be arrived at by the method prescribed in clause (1) of these conditions; (4) that if at any time the contractor receiving an operating-differential subsidy claims that he cannot maintain and operate his vessels in such an essential service, with a reasonable profit upon his investment, and applies to the Secretary of Transportation for a modification or rescission of his contract to maintain such essential service, and the Secretary of Transportation determines that such claim is proved the Secretary of Transportation shall modify or rescind such contract and permit the contractor to withdraw such vessels from such essential service upon a date fixed by the Secretary of Transportation, and upon the date of such withdrawal the further payment of the operating differential subsidy shall cease and the contractor be discharged from any further obligation under such contract; (5) that the contractor shall conduct his operations with respect to essential services and any services authorized under section 1183 of this Appendix, covered by his contract in an economical and efficient manner, and (6) that whenever practicable, an operator who receives subsidy with respect to subsistence of officers and crews shall use as such subsistence items only articles, materials, and supplies of the growth, production, and manufacture of the United States, as defined in section 1155 of this Appendix, except when it is necessary to purchase supplies outside the United States to enable such vessel to continue and complete her voyage, and an operator who receives subsidy with respect to repairs shall perform such repairs within any of the United States or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, except in an emergency.</p>

The deposits in the fund, and all withdrawals from the fund, whether qualified or nonqualified, shall be subject to such conditions and requirements as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe or are set forth in such agreement; except that the Secretary may not require any person to deposit in the fund for any taxable year more than 50 percent of that portion of such person's taxable income for such year (computed in the manner provided in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section) which is attributable to the operation of the agreement vessels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ceiling on deposits; lessees; &ldquo;agreement vessel&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount deposited under subsection (a) of this section in the fund for any taxable year shall not exceed the sum of:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the receipts from the investment or reinvestment of amounts held in such fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a lessee, the maximum amount which may be deposited with respect to an agreement vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B) for any period shall be reduced by any amount which, under an agreement entered into under this section, the owner is required or permitted to deposit for such period with respect to such vessel by reason of paragraph (1)(B).</p>

Such stock must be currently fully listed and registered on an exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange, and must be stock which would be acquired by prudent men of discretion and intelligence in such matters who are seeking a reasonable income and the preservation of their capital. If at any time the fair market value of the stock in the fund is more than the agreed percentage of the assets in the fund, any subsequent investment of amounts deposited in the fund, and any subsequent withdrawal from the fund, shall be made in such a way as to tend to restore the fund to a situation in which the fair market value of the stock does not exceed such agreed percentage. For purposes of this subsection, if the common stock of a corporation meets the requirements of this subsection and if the preferred stock of such corporation would meet such requirements but for the fact that it cannot be listed and registered as required because it is nonvoting stock, such preferred stock shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The contractor, upon compliance with the provisions of this section, may transfer to foreign registry the vessels covered by any operating-differential subsidy contract held by him, in the event that the United States defaults upon such contract or cancels it without just cause. Any contractor desiring to transfer any such vessel to foreign registry upon such default or cancelation shall file an application in writing with the Secretary of Transportation setting forth its contentions with respect to the lack of just cause or lawful grounds for such default or cancelation. The Secretary of Transportation shall afford the contractor an opportunity for a hearing within twenty days after such contractor files written application therefor, and after the testimony, if any, in such hearing has been reduced to writing and filed with the Secretary of Transportation, he shall, within a reasonable time, grant or deny the application by order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appeal from denial of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any such application is denied, the contractor may obtain a review of the order of denial in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court, within twenty days after the entry of such order, a written petition praying that the order of the Secretary of Transportation be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of Transportation or any officer designated by him for that purpose, and thereupon the Secretary of Transportation shall file in the court the record upon which the order complained of was entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing of such petition such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether such cancelation or default was without just cause, and to affirm or set aside such order. The judgment and decree of the court affirming or setting aside any such order of the Secretary of Transportation shall be final.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effectiveness of transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No transfer of vessels to foreign registry under this section shall become effective until any indebtedness to the Government or to any citizen of the United States, secured by such vessels, has been paid or discharged, and until after the expiration of ninety days from the date of final determination of the application or the appeal, if any. Within such ninety-day period the Secretary of Transportation may (1) with the consent of the contractor purchase the vessels at cost to the contractor plus cost of capital improvements thereon, less 4 per centum annual depreciation upon such vessel, and the actual depreciated costs of capital improvements thereon, or (2) reinstate the contract and adjust or settle the default found by the Secretary of Transportation or the court to exist.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Passenger vessel&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, &ldquo;passenger vessel&rdquo; means a vessel which (1) is of not less than ten thousand gross tons, and (2) has accommodations for not less than one hundred passengers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization for payment of subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of Transportation finds that the operation of any passenger vessel with respect to which a contract for the payment of an operating-differential subsidy has been entered into under section 1173 of this Appendix effective before January 2, 1960, is not required for all of each year, in order to furnish adequate service on the service, route, or line covered by such contract, he may amend such contract to agree to pay an operating-differential subsidy for operation of the vessel (1) on such service, route, or line for some part or no part of each year, and (2) on cruises for all or part of each year if such specific cruise is approved by the Secretary of Transportation under subsection (e) of this section: <em>Provided, however</em>, That no such vessel may cruise for more than seven months of each year to ports which are regularly served by another United States-flag passenger vessel pursuant to an operating-differential subsidy contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization for payment of subsidy to passenger vessels providing domestic service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation may authorize passenger vessels under operating-differential subsidy contracts to provide domestic service between specified ports while the vessels are on voyages in an essential service in the foreign commerce of the United States without reduction of operating-differential subsidy and the partial payback of construction-differential subsidy for operating in the domestic trades, if he finds that such domestic service will not result in a substantial deviation from the service, route, or line for which operating-differential subsidy is paid and will not adversely affect service on such service, route, or line.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions for cruises or domestic service while on voyages in an essential service in foreign commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a vessel is being operated on cruises or has been authorized under this section to provide domestic passenger services while on voyages in an essential service in foreign commerce of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection, it shall carry no mail unless required by law, or cargo except passengers&rsquo; luggage, except between those ports between which it may carry mail and cargo on its regular service assigned by contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it may not carry one-way passengers between those ports served by another United States carrier on its regular service assigned by contract, without the consent of such carrier, except between those ports between which it may carry one-way passengers on its own regular service assigned by contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it shall stop at other domestic ports only for the same time and the same purpose as is permitted with respect to a foreign-flag vessel which is carrying passengers who embarked at a domestic port, except that a cruise may end at a different port or coast from that where it began and may embark or disembark passengers at other domestic ports, either when not involving transportation in the domestic offshore trade in competition with a United States-flag passenger vessel offering berth service therein, or, if involving such transportation, with the consent of such carrier: <em>Provided, however</em>, That nothing herein shall be construed to repeal or modify section 1223(a) of this Appendix.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any other provisions of this chapter or of the Shipping Act, 1916 [46 App. U.S.C. 801 et seq.], to the contrary notwithstanding, with the approval of the Secretary of Transportation, it may carry cargo and mail between ports to the extent such carriage is not in direct competition with a carrier offering United States-flag berth service between those ports, or, if such carriage is in direct competition with one or more carriers offering United States-flag berth service between such ports, with the consent of the next scheduled United States-flag carrier, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in the judgment of the Maritime Administrator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Section 1175(c) of this Appendix shall not apply to cruises authorized under this section. Notwithstanding the applicable provisions of sections 1175(a) and 1156 of this Appendix requiring the reduction of operating differential subsidy and the partial payback of construction differential subsidy for operating in the domestic trades, such reduction of operating subsidy and <!-- PDFPage:134 -->partial payback of construction subsidy under sections 1175(a) and 1156, respectively, of this Appendix, shall not apply to cruises or domestic services authorized under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application for approval of cruise; notice to other American flag operators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the application of any operator for approval of a specific cruise, the Secretary of Transportation, after notice to all other American flag operators who may be affected and after affording all such operators an opportunity to submit written data, views or arguments, with or without opportunity to present the same orally in any manner, and after consideration of all relevant matter presented, shall approve the proposed cruise, if he determines that the proposed cruise will not substantially adversely affect an existing operator's service performed with passenger vessels of United States registry. Such approval shall not be given more than two years in advance of the beginning of the cruise.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Contracts under this chapter shall be entered into so as to equitably serve, insofar as possible, the foreign-trade requirements of the Atlantic, Gulf, Great Lakes, and Pacific ports of the United States. In order to assure equitable treatment for each range of ports referred to in the preceding sentence, not less than 10 percent of the funds appropriated for construction-differential subsidy and operating-differential subsidy pursuant to this chapter or any law authorizing funds for the purposes of this chapter shall be allocated to each such port range: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such allocation shall apply to the extent that subsidy contracts are approved by the Secretary of Transportation. For the purposes of this section and section 1121(a) of this Appendix, the Secretary shall establish trade routes, services, or lines that take into account the seasonal closure of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and provide for alternate routing of ships via a different range of ports during that closure so as to maintain continuity of service on a year-round basis. For the purposes of section 1175(c) of this Appendix, such an alternate routing via a different range of ports shall be deemed to be service from Great Lakes ports, provided such alternative routing is based upon receipt or delivery of cargo at Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Seaway ports under through intermodal bills of lading. The Secretary shall include in the annual report pursuant to section 1118 of this Appendix a detailed report (1) describing the actions that have been taken pursuant to this chapter to assure insofar as possible that direct and adequate service is provided by United States-flag commercial vessels to each range of ports referred to in this section; and (2) including any recommendations for additional legislation that may be necessary to achieve the purpose of this section. In awarding contracts under this chapter, preference shall be given to persons who are citizens of the United States and who have the support, financial and otherwise, of the domestic communities primarily interested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) There shall be established and maintained within the Maritime Administration such regional offices as may be necessary, including, but not limited to, one such office for each of the four port ranges specified in subsection (a) of this section. The Secretary of Transportation shall appoint a qualified individual to be the Director of each such regional office and shall carry out appropriate functions, activities, and programs of the Maritime Administration through such regional offices.</p>

The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe regulations under which agencies shall not pay for or reimburse officers or employees for travel or shipping expenses incurred on a foreign ship in the absence of satisfactory proof of the necessity therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cargoes procured, furnished or financed by United States; waiver in emergencies; exceptions; definition</h4>

Nothing herein shall repeal or otherwise modify the provisions of section 1241&ndash;1 of this Appendix. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels&rdquo; shall not be deemed to include any vessel which, subsequent to September 21, 1961, shall have been either (a) built outside the United States, (b) rebuilt outside the United States, or (c) documented under any foreign registry, until such vessel shall have been documented under the laws of the United States for a period of three years: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the provisions of this amendment shall not apply where, (1) prior to September 21, 1961, the owner of a vessel, or contractor for the purchase of a vessel, originally constructed in the United States and rebuilt abroad or contracted to be rebuilt abroad, has notified the Maritime Administration in writing of its intent to document such vessel under United States registry, and such vessel is so documented on its first arrival at a United States port not later than one year subsequent to September 21, 1961, or (2) where prior to September 21, 1961, the owner of a vessel under United States registry has made a contract for the rebuilding abroad of such vessel and has notified the Maritime Administration of such contract, and such rebuilding is completed and such vessel is thereafter documented under United States registry on its first arrival at a United States port not later than one year subsequent to September 21, 1961.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Every department or agency having responsibility under this subsection shall administer its programs with respect to this subsection under regulations issued by the Secretary of Transportation.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds and declares&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that a productive and healthy agricultural industry and a strong and active United States maritime industry are vitally important to the economic well-being and national security objectives of our Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that both industries must compete in international markets increasingly dominated by foreign trade barriers and the subsidization practices of foreign governments; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is therefore declared to be the purpose and policy of the Congress in sections 1241d to 1241p of this Appendix&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to enable the Department of Agriculture to plan its export programs effectively, by clarifying the ocean transportation requirements applicable to such programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to take immediate and positive steps to promote the growth of the cargo carrying capacity of the United States merchant marine;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:149 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to expand international trade in United States agricultural commodities and products and to develop, maintain, and expand markets for United States agricultural exports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to improve the efficiency of administration of both the commodity purchasing and selling and the ocean transportation activities associated with export programs sponsored by the Department of Agriculture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to stimulate and promote both the agricultural and maritime industries of the United States and encourage cooperative efforts by both industries to address their common problems; and</p>

Such obligations shall be at a rate of interest as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods of maturity comparable to the average maturities of such obligations during the month preceding the issuance of such obligations of the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligations of the Secretary of Transportation issued under this subsection and, for the purpose of purchasing such obligations, the Secretary of the Treasury may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 after December 23, 1985, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such <!-- PDFPage:152 -->chapter are extended to include any purchases of the obligations of the Secretary of Transportation under this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated annually for each fiscal year, commencing with the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1986, an amount sufficient to reimburse the Secretary of Transportation for the costs, including administrative expenses and the principal and interest due on the obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury incurred under this section. Reimbursement of any such costs shall be made with appropriated funds, as provided in this section, rather than through cancellation of notes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notification of Congress respecting failure to obtain funds necessary for financing</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1242. Requisition or purchase of vessels in time of emergency</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Compensation; restoration; consequential damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the President shall proclaim that the security of the national defense makes it advisable or during any national emergency declared by proclamation of the President, it shall be lawful for the Secretary of Transportation to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by citizens of the United States, a documented vessel, or a vessel under construction within the United States, or for any period during such emergency, to requisition or charter the use of any such property. The termination of any emergency so declared shall be announced by a further proclamation by the President. When any such property or the use thereof is so requisitioned, the owner thereof shall be paid just compensation for the property taken or for the use of such property, but in no case shall the value of the property taken or used be deemed enhanced by the causes necessitating the taking or use. If any property is taken and used under authority of this section, but the ownership thereof is not required by the United States, such property shall be restored to the owner in a condition at least as good as when taken, less ordinary wear and tear, or the owner shall be paid an amount for reconditioning sufficient to place the property in such condition. The owner shall not be paid for any consequential damages arising from a taking or use of property under authority of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of value of vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When any vessel is taken or used under authority of this section, upon which vessel a construction-differential subsidy has been allowed and paid, the value of the vessel at the time of its taking shall be determined as provided in section 1212 of this Appendix, and in determining the value of any vessel taken or used, on which a construction-differential subsidy has not been paid, the value of any national defense features previously paid for by the United States shall be excluded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Charter of vessels; compensation; reimbursement for loss or damage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any property is taken and used under authority of this section, but the ownership thereof is not required by the United States, the Secretary of Transportation, at the time of the taking or as soon thereafter as the exigencies of the situation may permit, shall transmit to the person entitled to the possession of such property a charter setting forth the terms which, in the Secretary's judgment, should govern the relationships between the United States and such person and a statement of the rate of hire which, in the Secretary's judgment, will be just compensation for the use of such property and for the services required under the terms of such charter. If such person does not execute and deliver such charter and accept such rate of hire, the Secretary of Transportation shall pay to such person as a tentative advance only, on account of such just compensation a sum equal to 75 per centum of such rate of hire as the same may from time to time be due under the terms <!-- PDFPage:157 -->of the charter so tendered, and such person shall be entitled to sue the United States in a court having jurisdiction of such claims to recover such amounts as would be equal to just compensation for the use of the property and for the services required in connection with such use: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in the event of an election by such person to reject the rate of hire fixed by the Secretary of Transportation and to sue in the courts, the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation over the amount of the court judgment will be required to be refunded. In the event of loss or damage to such property, due to operation of a risk assumed by the United States under the terms of a charter prescribed in this subsection, but no valuation of such vessel or other property or mode of compensation has been agreed to, the United States shall pay just compensation for such loss or damage, to the extent the person entitled thereto is not reimbursed therefor through policies of insurance against such loss or damage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of amount of compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In all cases, the just compensation authorized by this section shall be determined and paid by the Secretary of Transportation as soon as practicable, but if the amount of just compensation determined by the Secretary is unsatisfactory to the person entitled thereto; such person shall be paid, as a tentative advance only, 75 per centum of the amount so determined and shall be entitled to sue the United States to recover such amount as would equal just compensation therefor, in the manner provided for by sections 1346 and 1491 of title 28: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in that event of an election to reject the amount determined by the Secretary of Transportation and to sue in the courts, the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation over the amount of the court judgment will be required to be refunded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The existence of any valid claim by way of mortgage or maritime claim or attachment lien upon such vessel shall not prevent the taking thereof pursuant to this section: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in the event any such claim exists the Secretary of Transportation may in his discretion deposit such portion of the compensation hereunder, or advances on account thereof, as may equal but not exceed the amount of such claims in respect of the vessel, with the Treasurer of the United States, and the fund so deposited shall be available for the payment of such compensation, and shall be subject to be applied to the payment of the amount of any valid claim by way of mortgage or maritime lien or attachment lien upon such vessel, or of any stipulation therefor in a court of the United States, or of any State, subsisting at the time of such requisition or taking of title or possession; the holder of any such claim may commence prior to June 30, 1943, or within six months after the first such deposit with the Treasurer and publication of notice thereof in the Federal Register, whichever date is later, and maintain in the United States district court from whose custody such vessel has been or may be taken or in whose territorial jurisdiction the vessel was lying at the time of requisitioning or taking of title or possession, a suit in admiralty according to the principles of libels in rem against the fund, which shall proceed and be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties, and any decree in said suit shall be paid out of the first and all subsequent deposits of compensation; and such suit shall be commenced in the manner provided by section 742 of this Appendix and service of process shall be made in the manner therein provided by service upon the United States attorney and by mailing by registered mail to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation and due notice shall under order of the court be given to all interested persons, and any decree shall be subject to appeal and revision as now provided in other cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of vessels by Secretary; transfer to other departments or agencies; reimbursement of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to repair, recondition, reconstruct, and operate, or charter for operation, any property acquired under authority of this section. The Secretary of Transportation is further authorized to transfer the possession or control of any such property to any department or agency of the Government of the United States upon such terms and conditions as may be approved by the President. In case of any such transfer the department or agency to which the transfer is made shall promptly reimburse the Secretary of Transportation for the Department of Transportation's expenditures on account of just compensation, purchase price, repairs, reconditioning, reconstruction, or charter hire for the property transferred. Such reimbursements shall be deposited in the construction fund established by section 1116 of this Appendix.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Essential vessel&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When used in this section the term &ldquo;essential vessel&rdquo; means any vessel (1) which is (A) security for any mortgage indebtedness to the United States or (B) constructed under this chapter, or required by the terms of a contract under this chapter to be operated on a certain essential foreign trade route, and (2) which it is necessary in the interests of commerce and national defense to maintain in condition for prompt use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment of obligations and arrangements for maintenance of essential vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of preserving in the national interest the full availability and usefulness of essential vessels, which, under the provisions of the Neutrality Act of 1939 [22 U.S.C. 441 et seq.] (or any proclamation issued thereunder), or compatibly with the national interest, cannot be operated in the service, route, or line to which such vessels are assigned pursuant to this chapter, or in which they would otherwise be operated, the Secretary of Transportation is authorized to make adjustments of obligations in respect to such vessels and to make arrangements for the maintenance of such vessels, subject to the provisions of this section and to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this section. If the Secretary of Transportation, upon written application in respect of any essential vessel, determines after such examination, investigation, and proceedings as he deems desirable, that (1) the operation of such vessel in the service, route, or line to which such vessel is assigned pursuant to this chapter, or in which it would otherwise be operated, is either (A) not lawful under the Neutrality Act of 1939 (or any proclamation issued thereunder), or (B) not compatible with the maintenance of availability of such vessel for purposes of national defense and commerce, (2) it is not feasible under existing law to employ such vessel in any other service or operation in either the foreign or domestic trades (except temporary or emergency operation under subsection (c)(5) hereof), and (3) the applicant, by reason of the restrictions of the Neutrality Act of 1939, or the withdrawal of vessels for national-defense purposes under clause (1) hereof, is not earning or will not earn a fair and reasonable return on the capital necessarily employed in its business, the Secretary of Transportation may make adjustments and arrangements with the applicant as provided in subsection (c) of this section, which shall continue in effect only during the circumstances above described.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provisions included within adjustments and arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such adjustments and arrangements shall include suspension of the requirement to operate such vessel in foreign trade under the applicable operating-differential or construction-differential subsidy contract or mortgage or other agreement, and of the right to operating-differential subsidy in respect of such vessel, and may include any one or more of the following provisions, in whole or in part, as, and to the extent that, the Secretary of Transportation may deem to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, or the purposes and provisions of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Lay-up of the vessel by the owner or, at the option of the Secretary of Transportation, <!-- PDFPage:159 -->in the custody of the Secretary of Transportation, with payment or reimbursement by the Secretary of Transportation of necessary and proper expenses thereof (including reasonable overhead and insurance), or in lieu of such payment or reimbursement, a fixed periodic allowance therefor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Postponement, for a period not in excess of the period or periods of lay-up, of the maturity date of each installment on account of the principal of obligations to the United States in respect of the vessel (whether or not such maturity date shall fall within such period or periods), or rearrangement of such maturities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Postponement or cancellation of interest accruing on such obligations during such period or periods of lay-up;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Extension for a period not in excess of the period or periods of lay-up, of the twenty-year life limitation in respect of the vessel, and of the period or periods of other limitations and provisions of this chapter, insofar as they are based upon a twenty-year life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Provisions for such temporary or emergency employment of the vessel in lieu of lay-up as may be practicable, with such arrangements for management of the vessel, payment of expenses, and application of the proceeds of such employment, as the Secretary of Transportation may approve, the period or periods of such operation being included as part of the period or periods of lay-up;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The payment to the Secretary of Transportation, upon termination of the arrangements with the applicant hereunder, out of the applicant's net profits, earned while such arrangements were in effect, in excess of 10 per centum per annum on the capital necessarily employed in the applicant's business, in reimbursement, to the extent that the Secretary of Transportation shall deem it necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, on account of obligations postponed or canceled and expenses incurred or paid by the Secretary of Transportation under this subsection. For the purposes of this paragraph capital of the applicant represented by vessels of the applicant laid up or operated under this section shall not be excluded from capital necessarily employed in the applicant's business. The Secretary of Transportation may require that the vessels so laid up or operated be security for reimbursement hereunder.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Readjustment or modification of adjustments and arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The adjustments and arrangements made under subsection (c) of this section in respect of any vessel shall be subject to such readjustment or modification from time to time as may be deemed necessary by the Secretary of Transportation to carry out the purposes and provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expenses incurred in adjustments and arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Moneys in the construction fund of the Secretary of Transportation shall be available for expenses of the Secretary of Transportation incurred in adjustments or arrangements made under this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Principal and interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary or Administrator is authorized to guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, the payment of the interest on, and the unpaid balance of the principal of, any obligation which is eligible to be guaranteed under this subchapter. A guarantee, or commitment to guarantee, made by the Secretary or Administrator under this subchapter shall cover 100 percent of the amount of the principal and interest of the obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Security interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No obligation shall be guaranteed under this subchapter unless the obligor conveys or agrees to convey to the Secretary or Administrator such security interest, which may include a mortgage or mortgages on a vessel or vessels, as the Secretary or Administrator may reasonably require to protect the interest of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of guarantee; percentage limitation; determination of actual cost of vessel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary or Administrator shall not guarantee the principal of obligations in an amount in excess of 75 per centum, or 871/2 per centum, whichever is applicable under section 1274&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1273_1_target" name="1273_1">1</a></sup> of this Appendix, of the amount, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator which determination shall be conclusive, paid by or for the account of the obligor for the construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a vessel or vessels with respect to which a security interest has been conveyed to the Secretary or Administrator, unless the obligor creates an escrow fund as authorized by section 1279a of this Appendix, in which case the Secretary or Administrator may guarantee 75 per centum or 871/2 per centum, whichever is applicable under section 1274 of this Appendix, of the actual cost of such vessel or vessels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Pledge of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this subchapter with respect to both principal and interest, including interest, as <!-- PDFPage:166 -->may be provided for in the guarantee, accruing between the date of default under a guaranteed obligation and the payment in full of the guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Proof of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any guarantee, or commitment to guarantee, made by the Secretary or Administrator under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the obligations for such guarantee, and the validity of any guarantee, or commitment to guarantee, so made shall be incontestable. Notwithstanding an assumption of an obligation by the Secretary or Administrator under section 1275(a) or (b) of this Appendix, the validity of the guarantee of an obligation made by the Secretary or Administrator under this subchapter is unaffected and the guarantee remains in full force and effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on outstanding amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate unpaid principal amount of the obligations guaranteed under this section and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $12,000,000,000, of which (1) $850,000,000 shall be limited to obligations pertaining to guarantees of obligations for fishing vessels and fishery facilities made under this subchapter, and (2) $3,000,000,000 shall be limited to obligations pertaining to guarantees of obligations for eligible export vessels. No additional limitations may be imposed on new commitments to guarantee loans for any fiscal year, except in such amounts as established in advance in annual authorization Acts. No vessel eligible for guarantees under this subchapter shall be denied eligibility because of its type.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Restrictions on commitments to guarantee obligations on eligible export vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary or Administrator may not issue a commitment to guarantee obligations for an eligible export vessel unless, after considering&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the economic soundness of the applications referred to in subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount of guarantee authority available,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary or Administrator determines, in the sole discretion of the Secretary or Administrator, that the issuance of a commitment to guarantee obligations for an eligible export vessel will not result in the denial of an economically sound application to issue a commitment to guarantee obligations for vessels documented under the laws of the United States operating in the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary or Administrator may not issue commitments to guarantee obligations for eligible export vessels under this section after the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) annually determine for each of the risk categories a subsidy rate equivalent to the cost of obligations in the category, expressed as a percentage of the amount guaranteed under this subchapter for obligations in the category; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) ensure that each risk category is comprised of loans that are relatively homogeneous in cost and share characteristics predictive of defaults and other costs, given the facts known at the time of obligation or commitment, using a risk category system that is based on historical analysis of program data and statistical evidence concerning the likely costs of defaults or other costs that expected to be associated with the loans in the category.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Before making a guarantee under this section for an obligation, and annually for projects subject to a guarantee, the Secretary or Administrator shall apply the risk factors set forth in paragraph (3) to place the obligation in a risk category established under paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary or Administrator shall consider the aggregate amount available to the Secretary or Administrator for making guarantees under this subchapter to be reduced by the amount determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount guaranteed under this subchapter for an obligation, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the subsidy rate for the category in which the obligation is placed under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The estimated cost to the Government of a guarantee made by the Secretary or Administrator under this subchapter for an obligation is deemed to be the amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary or Administrator may not guarantee obligations under this subchapter after the aggregate amount available to the Secretary or Administrator under appropriations Acts for the cost of loan guarantees is required by subparagraph (B) to be considered reduced to zero.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The risk factors referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If applicable, the country risk for each eligible export vessel financed or to be financed by an obligation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:167 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The period for which an obligation is guaranteed or to be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The amount of an obligation, which is guaranteed or to be guaranteed, in relation to the total cost of the project financed or to be financed by the obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The financial condition of an obligor or applicant for a guarantee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) If applicable, any guarantee related to the project, other than the guarantee under this subchapter for which the risk factor is applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) If applicable, the projected employment of each vessel or equipment to be financed with an obligation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) If applicable, the projected market that will be served by each vessel or equipment to be financed with an obligation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Priority for national defense tank vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In guaranteeing and entering commitments to guarantee under this section, the Administrator shall give priority to guarantees and commitments for vessels that are otherwise eligible for a guarantee under this section and that are constructed with assistance under subtitle D of the Maritime Security Act of 2003.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Priority for other vessels suitable for service as a naval auxiliary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In guaranteeing and entering commitments to guarantee under this section, the Administrator shall, after applying subsection (i) of this section, give priority to a guarantee or commitment for a vessel that is otherwise eligible for a guarantee under this section and that the Secretary of Defense determines&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Rights of obligee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a default, which has continued for thirty days, in any payment by the obligor of principal or interest due under an obligation guaranteed under this subchapter, the obligee or his agent shall have the right to demand (unless the Secretary or Administrator shall, upon such terms as may be provided in the obligation or related agreements, prior to that demand, have assumed the obligor's rights and duties under the obligation and agreements and shall have made any payments in default), at or before the expiration of such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, but not later than ninety days from the date of such default, payment by the Secretary or Administrator of the unpaid principal amount of said obligation and of the unpaid interest thereon to the date of payment. Within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, but not later than thirty days from the date of such demand, the Secretary or Administrator shall promptly pay to the obligee or his agent the unpaid principal amount of said obligation and unpaid interest thereon to the date of payment: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary or Administrator shall not be required to make such payment if prior to the expiration of said period he shall find that there was no default by the obligor in the payment of principal or interest or that such default has been remedied prior to any such demand.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice of default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a default under a mortgage, loan agreement, or other security agreement between the obligor and the Secretary or Administrator, the Secretary or Administrator may upon such terms as may be provided in the obligation or related agreement, either:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assume the obligor's rights and duties under the agreement, make any payment in default, and notify the obligee or the obligee's agent of the default and the assumption by the Secretary or Administrator; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) notify the obligee or the obligee's agent of the default, and the obligee or the obligee's agent shall have the right to demand at or before the expiration of such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, but not later than 60 days from the date of such notice, payment by the Secretary or Administrator of the unpaid principal amount of said obligation and of the unpaid interest thereon.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of property by the United States, the Secretary or Administrator shall have the right, in his discretion, to complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, operate, charter, or sell any property acquired by him pursuant to a security agreement with the obligor or may place a vessel in the national defense reserve. The terms of the sale shall be as approved by the Secretary or Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cash payments; issuance of notes or obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any amount required to be paid by the Secretary or Administrator pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, shall be paid in cash. If at any time the moneys in the Fund authorized by section 1272 of this Appendix are not sufficient to pay any amount the Secretary or Administrator is required to pay by subsection (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary or Administrator is authorized to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary or Administrator, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of such notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes and other obligations to be issued hereunder and for such purpose he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter, are extended to include any purchases of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this section. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. Funds borrowed under this section shall be deposited in the Fund and redemptions of such notes and obligations shall be made by the Secretary or Administrator from such Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Actions against obligor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of a default under any guaranteed obligation or any related agreement, the Secretary or Administrator shall take such action against the obligor or any other parties liable thereunder that, in his discretion, may be re<!-- PDFPage:180 -->quired to protect the interests of the United States. Any suit may be brought in the name of the United States or in the name of the obligee and the obligee shall make available to the United States all records and evidence necessary to prosecute any such suit. The Secretary or Administrator shall have the right, in his discretion, to accept a conveyance of title to and possession of property from the obligor or other parties liable to the Secretary or Administrator, and may purchase the property for an amount not greater than the unpaid principal amount of such obligation and interest thereon. In the event that the Secretary or Administrator shall receive through the sale of property an amount of cash in excess of the unpaid principal amount of the obligation and unpaid interest on the obligation and the expenses of collection of those amounts, the Secretary or Administrator shall pay the excess to the obligor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Default response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event of default on an obligation, the Secretary shall conduct operations under this subchapter in a manner which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of assets associated with the obligation, including prompt referral to the Attorney General for collection as appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) minimizes the amount of any loss realized in the resolution of the guarantee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensures adequate competition and fair and consistent treatment of offerors; and</p>

If the aggregate actual cost of the vessel has increased since the Secretary's or Administrator's initial approval or if it increases after the first disbursement is permitted under this subsection, then no further disbursements shall be made under subsection (b) of this section until the total amount paid by or for the account of the obligor from sources other than the proceeds of the obligation equals at least 25 percent or 121/2 percent, as applicable, of the increase, as determined by the Secretary or Administrator, in the aggregate actual cost of the vessel. Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary or Administrator to consent to finance any increase in actual cost unless the Secretary or Administrator determines that such an increase in the obligation meets all the terms and conditions of this subchapter or other applicable law.</p>

In the event of the actual or constructive total loss of the vessel, if the insured has not rejected such valuation the amount of any claim therefor which is adjusted, compromised, settled, adjudged, or paid shall not exceed such stated amount, but if the insured has so rejected such valuation, the insured shall be paid as a tentative advance only, 75 per centum of such valuation so determined by the Secretary and shall be entitled to sue the United States in a court having jurisdiction of such claims to recover such valuation as would be equal to the just compensation which such court determines would have been payable if the vessel had been requisitioned for title under section 1242(a) of this Appendix at the time of the attachment of the insurance under said policy: <em>Provided</em>, That in the event of an election by the insured to reject the stated valuation fixed by the Secretary and to sue in the courts, the amount of the judgment will be payable without regard to the limitations contained in section 1242&ndash;1&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1289_1_target" name="1289_1">1</a></sup> of this Appendix, although the excess of any amounts advanced on account of just compensation over the amount of the court judgment will be required to be refunded.

If the claimant has no residence in the United States, suit may be brought in the district court of the District of Columbia or in such other district court in which the Attorney General of the United States agrees to accept service. Such suits shall be heard and determined under the provisions of the Act of March 9, 1920, as amended (known as the Suits in Admiralty Act) [46 App. U.S.C. 741 et seq.]. All persons having or claiming or who might have an interest in such insurance, may be made parties either initially or upon the motion of either party. In any case where the Secretary acknowledges the indebtedness of the United States on account of such insurance, and there is a dispute as to the persons entitled to receive payment, the United States may bring an action in the nature of a bill of interpleader against such parties, in the District Court for the District of Columbia, or in the district court of the district in which any such person resides. In such actions any party, if not a resident of or found within the district, may be brought in by order of court served in such reasonable manner as the court directs. If the court is satisfied that persons unknown might assert a claim on account of such insurance, it may direct service upon such persons unknown by publication in the Federal Register. Judgment in any such suit shall discharge the United States from further liability to any parties to such action, and to all persons when service by publication upon persons unknown is directed by the court. The period within which suits may be commenced contained in said Suits in Admiralty Act shall, if claim be filed therefor within such period, be suspended from such time of filing until the claim shall have been administratively denied by the Secretary and for sixty days thereafter: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such claim shall be deemed to have been administratively denied if not acted upon within six months after the time of filing, unless the Secretary for good cause shown shall have otherwise agreed with the claimant.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(1) Seaworthiness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The carrier shall be bound, before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Make the ship seaworthy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Properly man, equip, and supply the ship;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cooling chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried, fit and safe for their reception, carriage, and preservation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) Cargo</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(3) Contents of bill</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier, or the master or agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper before the loading of such goods starts, provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered, or on the cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:206 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) The apparent order and condition of the goods: <em>Provided</em>, That no carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, shall be bound to state or show in the bill of lading any marks, number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately to represent the goods actually received, or which he has had no reasonable means of checking.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(4) Bill as prima facie evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraphs (3)(a), (b), and (c), of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this chapter shall be construed as repealing or limiting the application of any part of chapter 801 of title 49.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(5) Guaranty of statements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity, and weight, as furnished by him; and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages, and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(6) Notice of loss or damage; limitation of actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading. If the loss or damage is not apparent, the notice must be given within three days of the delivery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Said notice of loss or damage may be endorsed upon the receipt for the goods given by the person taking delivery thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has at the time of their receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered: <em>Provided</em>, That if a notice of loss or damage, either apparent or concealed, is not given as provided for in this section, that fact shall not affect or prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(7) &ldquo;Shipped&rdquo; bill of lading</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier to the shipper shall, if the shipper so demands, be a &ldquo;shipped&rdquo; bill of lading: <em>Provided</em>, That if the shipper shall have previously taken up any document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the issue of the &ldquo;shipped&rdquo; bill of lading, but at the option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or dates of shipment, and when so noted the same shall for the purpose of this section be deemed to constitute a &ldquo;shipped&rdquo; bill of lading.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(8) Limitation of liability for negligence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to or in connection with the goods, arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section, or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this chapter, shall be null and void and of no effect. A benefit of insurance in favor of the carrier, or similar clause, shall be deemed to be a clause relieving the carrier from liability.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(1) Unseaworthiness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned, equipped, and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception, carriage, and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of section 1303 of this Appendix. Whenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness, the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other persons claiming exemption under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) Uncontrollable causes of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot, or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Perils, dangers, and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) Arrest or restraint of princes, rulers, or people, or seizure under legal process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Quarantine restrictions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods, his agent or representative;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:207 --><p class="statutory-body">(j) Strikes or lockouts or stoppage or restraint of labor from whatever cause, whether partial or general: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve a carrier from responsibility for the carrier's own acts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Riots and civil commotions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Saving or attempting to save life or property at sea;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) Wastage in bulk or weight or any other loss or damage arising from inherent defect, quality, or vice of the goods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) Insufficiency of packing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) Insufficiency or inadequacy of marks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(p) Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(q) Any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier and without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(3) Freedom from negligence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act, fault, or neglect of the shipper, his agents, or his servants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(4) Deviations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of this chapter or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom: <em>Provided, however</em>, That if the deviation is for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo or passengers it shall, prima facie, be regarded as unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(5) Amount of liability; valuation of cargo</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of the United States, or in case of goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit, or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading. This declaration, if embodied in the bill of lading, shall be prima facie evidence, but shall not be conclusive on the carrier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">By agreement between the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, and the shipper another maximum amount than that mentioned in this paragraph may be fixed: <em>Provided</em>, That such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named. In no event shall the carrier be liable for more than the amount of damage actually sustained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of the goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowingly and fraudulently misstated by the shipper in the bill of lading.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(6) Inflammable, explosive, or dangerous cargo</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Goods of an inflammable, explosive, or dangerous nature to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier, has not consented with knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment. If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general average, if any.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 7 days after an agreement is filed, the Commission shall transmit a notice of its filing to the Federal Register for publication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall reject any agreement filed under section 1704(a) of this Appendix that, after preliminary review, it finds does not meet the requirements of section 1704 of this Appendix. The Commission shall notify in writing the person filing the agreement of the reason for rejection of the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review and effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless rejected by the Commission under subsection (b) of this section, agreements, other than assessment agreements, shall become effective&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Term of agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may not limit the effectiveness of an agreement to a fixed term.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Substantially anticompetitive agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, at any time after the filing or effective date of an agreement, the Commission determines that the agreement is likely, by a reduction in competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost, it may, after notice to the person filing the agreement, seek appropriate injunctive relief under subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Injunctive relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, upon making the determination specified in subsection (g) of this section, bring suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin operation of the agreement.

In a suit under this subsection, the burden of proof is on the Commission. The court may not allow a third party to intervene with respect to a claim under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Compliance with informational needs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Except for an agreement filed under section 1704 of this Appendix, information and documentary material filed with the Commission under section 1704 of this Appendix or this section is exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5 and may not be made public except as may be relevant to an administrative or judicial action or proceeding. This section does not prevent disclosure to either body of Congress or to a duly authorized committee or subcommittee of Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon notice to the Attorney General, the Commission may represent itself in district court proceedings under subsections (h) and (i) of this section and section 1710(h) of this Appendix.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Tariffs shall be made available electronically to any person, without time, quantity, or <!-- PDFPage:223 -->other limitation, through appropriate access from remote locations, and a reasonable charge may be assessed for such access. No charge may be assessed a Federal agency for such access.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time-volume rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Rates shown in tariffs filed under subsection (a) of this section may vary with the volume of cargo offered over a specified period of time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Service contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual ocean common carrier or an agreement between or among ocean common carriers may enter into a service contract with one or more shippers subject to the requirements of this chapter. The exclusive remedy for a breach of a contract entered into under this subsection shall be an action in an appropriate court, unless the parties otherwise agree. In no case may the contract dispute resolution forum be controlled by or in any way affiliated with a controlled carrier as defined in section 1702(8) of this Appendix, or by the government which owns or controls the carrier.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Filing requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except for service contracts dealing with bulk cargo, forest products, recycled metal scrap, new assembled motor vehicles, waste paper, or paper waste, each contract entered into under this subsection by an individual ocean common carrier or an agreement shall be filed confidentially with the Commission.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Disclosure of certain terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An ocean common carrier, which is a party to or is subject to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement with a labor organization, shall, in response to a written request by such labor organization, state whether it is responsible for the following work at dock areas and within port areas in the United States with respect to cargo transportation under a service contract described in paragraph (1) of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the movement of the shipper's cargo on a dock area or within the port area or to or from railroad cars on a dock area or within the port area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the assignment of intraport carriage of the shipper's cargo between areas on a dock or within the port area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the assignment of the carriage of the shipper's cargo between a container yard on a dock area or within the port area and a rail yard adjacent to such container yard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the assignment of container freight station work and container maintenance and repair work performed at a dock area or within the port area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The common carrier shall provide the information described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to the requesting labor organization within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) This paragraph requires the disclosure of information by an ocean common carrier only if there exists an applicable and otherwise lawful collective bargaining agreement which pertains to that carrier. No disclosure made by an ocean common carrier shall be deemed to be an admission or agreement that any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Any dispute regarding whether any work is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the responsibility of the ocean common carrier under such agreement shall be resolved solely in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement and the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and without reference to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Nothing in this paragraph shall have any effect on the lawfulness or unlawfulness under this chapter, the National Labor Relations Act [29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], the Taft-Hartley Act [29 U.S.C. 141 et seq.], the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.], the antitrust laws, or any other Federal or State law, or any revisions or amendments thereto, of any collective bargaining agreement or element thereof, including any element that constitutes an essential term of a service contract under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) For purposes of this paragraph the terms &ldquo;dock area&rdquo; and &ldquo;within the port area&rdquo; shall have the same meaning and scope as in the applicable collective bargaining agreement between the requesting labor organization and the carrier.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Tariff rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No new or initial rate or change in an existing rate that results in an increased cost to the shipper may become effective earlier than 30 calendar days after publication. The Commission, for good cause, may allow such a new or initial rate or change to become effective in less than 30 calendar days. A change in an existing rate that results in a decreased cost to the shipper may become effective upon publication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Refunds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, upon application of a carrier or shipper, permit a common carrier or conference to refund a portion of freight charges collected from a shipper or to waive the collection of a portion of the charges from a shipper if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:224 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is an error in a,<sup><a href="#1707_2_target" name="1707_2">2</a></sup> in failing to publish a new tariff, or an error in quoting a tariff, and the refund will not result in discrimination among shippers, ports, or carriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the common carrier or conference has, prior to filing an application for authority to make a refund for an error in a tariff or a failure to publish a tariff, published a new tariff that sets forth the rate on which the refund or waiver would be based; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the application for refund or waiver is filed with the Commission within 180 days from the date of shipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Marine terminal operator schedules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A marine terminal operator may make available to the public, subject to section 1709(d) of this Appendix, a schedule of rates, regulations, and practices, including limitations of liability for cargo loss or damage, pertaining to receiving, delivering, handling, or storing property at its marine terminal. Any such schedule made available to the public shall be enforceable by an appropriate court as an implied contract without proof of actual knowledge of its provisions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall by regulation prescribe the requirements for the accessibility and accuracy of automated tariff systems established under this section. The Commission may, after periodic review, prohibit the use of any automated tariff system that fails to meet the requirements established under this section. The Commission may not require a common carrier to provide a remote terminal for access under subsection (a)(2) of this section. The Commission shall by regulation prescribe the form and manner in which marine terminal operator schedules authorized by this section shall be published.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1708. Controlled carriers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Controlled carrier rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No controlled carrier subject to this section may maintain rates or charges in its tariffs or service contracts, or charge or assess rates, that are below a level that is just and reasonable, nor may any such carrier establish&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1708_1_target" name="1708_1">1</a></sup> maintain, or enforce unjust or unreasonable classifications, rules, or regulations in those tariffs or service contracts. An unjust or unreasonable classification, rule, or regulation means one that results or is likely to result in the carriage or handling of cargo at rates or charges that are below a just and reasonable level. The Commission may, at any time after notice and hearing, prohibit the publication or use of any rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations that the controlled carrier has failed to demonstrate to be just and reasonable. In a proceeding under this subsection, the burden of proof is on the controlled carrier to demonstrate that its rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are just and reasonable. Rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations that have been suspended or prohibited by the Commission are void and their use is unlawful.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rate standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, in determining whether rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations by a controlled carrier are just and reasonable, the Commission shall take into account whether the rates or charges which have been published or assessed or which would result from the pertinent classifications, rules, or regulations are below a level which is fully compensatory to the controlled carrier based upon that carrier's actual costs or upon its constructive costs. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;constructive costs&rdquo; means the costs of another carrier, other than a controlled carrier, operating similar vessels and equipment in the same or a similar trade. The Commission may also take into account other appropriate factors, including but not limited to, whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are the same as or similar to those published or assessed or assessed&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1708_2_target" name="1708_2">2</a></sup> by other carriers in the same trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are required to assure movement of particular cargo in the trade; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations are required to maintain acceptable continuity, level, or quality of common carrier service to or from affected ports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effective date of rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1707(d) of this Appendix and except for service contracts, the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations of controlled carriers may not, without special permission of the Commission, become effective sooner than the 30th day after the date of publication. Each controlled carrier shall, upon the request of the Commission, file, within 20 days of request (with respect to its existing or proposed rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations), a statement of justification that sufficiently details the controlled carrier's need and purpose for such rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations upon which the Commission may reasonably base its determination of the lawfulness thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibition of rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 120 days after the receipt of information requested by the Commission under this section, the Commission shall determine whether the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations of a controlled carrier may be unjust and unreasonable. Whenever the Commission is of the opinion that the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations published or assessed by a controlled carrier may be unjust and unreasonable, the Commission shall issue an order to the controlled carrier to show cause why those rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations should not be prohibited. Pending a determination as to their lawfulness in such a proceeding, the Commission may suspend the rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations at any time before their effective date. In the case of rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations that have already become effective, the Commission may, upon the issuance of an order to show cause, suspend those rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations on not less than 30 days&rsquo; notice to the controlled carrier. No period of suspension under this subsection may be greater than 180 days. Whenever the Commission has suspended any rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations under this subsection, the affected controlled carrier may publish new rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations to take effect immediately during the suspension period in lieu of the suspended rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations&mdash;except that the Commission may reject the new rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations if it is of the opinion that they are unjust and unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Presidential review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Concurrently with the publication thereof, the Commission shall transmit to the President each order of suspension or final order of prohibition of rates, charges, classifications, rules, or regulations of a controlled carrier subject to this section. Within 10 days after the receipt or the effective date of the Commission order, the President may request the Commission in writing to stay the effect of the Commission's order if the President finds that the stay is required for reasons of national defense or foreign policy, which reasons shall be specified in the report. Notwithstanding any other law, the Commission shall immediately grant the request by the issu<!-- PDFPage:226 -->ance of an order in which the President's request shall be described. During any such stay, the President shall, whenever practicable, attempt to resolve the matter in controversy by negotiation with representatives of the applicable foreign governments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a controlled carrier of a state whose vessels are entitled by a treaty of the United States to receive national or most-favored-nation treatment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a trade served exclusively by controlled carriers.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing of complaints</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person may file with the Commission a sworn complaint alleging a violation of this chapter, other than section 1705(g) of this Appendix, and may seek reparation for any injury caused to the complainant by that violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Satisfaction or investigation of complaints</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall furnish a copy of a complaint filed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section to the person named therein who shall, within a reasonable time specified by the Commission, satisfy the complaint or answer it in writing. If the complaint is not satisfied, the Commission shall investigate it in an appropriate manner and make an appropriate order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Commission investigations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission, upon complaint or upon its own motion, may investigate any conduct or agreement that it believes may be in violation of this chapter. Except in the case of an injunction granted under subsection (h) of this section, each agreement under investigation under this section remains in effect until the Commission issues an order under this subsection. The Commission may by order disapprove, cancel, or modify any agreement filed under section 1704(a) of this Appendix that operates in violation of this chapter. With respect to agreements inconsistent with section 1705(g) of this Appendix, the Commission's sole remedy is under section 1705(h) of this Appendix.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conduct of investigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 10 days after the initiation of a proceeding under this section, the Commission shall set a date on or before which its final decision will be issued. This date may be extended for good cause by order of the Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Undue delays</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, within the time period specified in subsection (d) of this section, the Commission determines that it is unable to issue a final decision because of undue delays caused by a party to the proceedings, the Commission may impose sanctions, including entering a decision adverse to the delaying party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall make a written report of every investigation made under this chapter in which a hearing was held stating its conclusions, decisions, findings of fact, and order.

The Commission shall publish each report for public information, and the published report shall be competent evidence in all courts of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reparations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any complaint filed within 3 years after the cause of action accrued, the Commission shall, upon petition of the complainant and after notice and hearing, direct payment of reparations to the complainant for actual injury (which, for purposes of this subsection, also includes the loss of interest at commercial rates compounded from the date of injury) caused by a violation of this chapter plus reasonable attorney's fees. Upon a showing that the injury was caused by activity that is prohibited by section 1709(b)(3) or (6) of this Appendix or section 1709(c)(1) or (3) of this Appendix, or that violates section 1709(a)(2) or (3) of this Appendix, the Commission may direct the payment of additional amounts; but the total recovery of a complainant may not exceed twice the amount of the actual injury. In the case of injury caused by an activity that is prohibited by section 1709(b)(4)(A) or (B) of this Appendix, the amount of the injury shall be the difference between the rate paid by the injured shipper and the most favorable rate paid by another shipper.</p>

Any such suit shall be brought in a district in which the defendant resides or transacts business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After filing a complaint with the Commission under subsection (a) of this section, the complainant may file suit in a district court of the United States to enjoin conduct in violation of this chapter. Upon a showing that standards for granting injunctive relief by courts of equity are met and after notice to the defendant, the court may grant a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction for a period not to ex<!-- PDFPage:230 -->ceed 10 days after the Commission has issued an order disposing of the complaint. Any such suit shall be brought in the district in which the defendant has been sued by the Commission under paragraph (1); or, if no suit has been filed, in a district in which the defendant resides or transacts business. A defendant that prevails in a suit under this paragraph shall be allowed reasonable attorney's fees to be assessed and collected as part of the costs of the suit.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1712. Penalties</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assessment of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whoever violates a provision of this chapter, a regulation issued thereunder, or a Commission order is liable to the United States for a civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, may not exceed $5,000 for each violation unless the violation was willfully and knowingly committed, in which case the amount of the civil penalty may not exceed $25,000 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation constitutes a separate offense. The amount of any penalty imposed upon a common carrier under this subsection shall constitute a lien upon the vessels operated by that common carrier and any such vessel may be libeled therefore in the district court of the United States for the district in which it may be found.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For a violation of section 1709(b)(1), (2), or (7) of this Appendix, the Commission may suspend any or all tariffs of the common carrier, or that common carrier's right to use any or all tariffs of conferences of which it is a member, for a period not to exceed 12 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For failure to supply information ordered to be produced or compelled by subpena under section 1711 of this Appendix, the Commission may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, suspend any or all tariffs of a common carrier, or that common carrier's right to use any or all tariffs of conferences of which it is a member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A common carrier that accepts or handles cargo for carriage under a tariff that has been suspended or after its right to utilize that tariff has been suspended is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each shipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Commission finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that a common carrier has failed to supply information ordered to be produced or compelled by subpoena under section 1711 of this Appendix, the Commission may request that the Secretary of the Treasury refuse or revoke any clearance required for a vessel operated by that common carrier. Upon request by the Commission, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, with respect to the vessel concerned, refuse or revoke any clearance required by section 91 of this Appendix.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, in defense of its failure to comply with a subpena or discovery order, a common carrier alleges that documents or information located in a foreign country cannot be produced because of the laws of that country, the Commission shall immediately notify the Secretary of State of the failure to comply and of the allegation relating to foreign laws. Upon receiving the notification, the Secretary of State shall promptly consult with the government of the nation within which the documents or information are alleged to be located for the purpose of assisting the Commission in obtaining the documents or information sought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If, after notice and hearing, the Commission finds that the action of a common carrier, acting alone or in concert with any person, or a foreign government has unduly impaired access of a vessel documented under the laws of the United States to ocean trade between foreign ports, the Commission shall take action that it finds appropriate, including the imposition of any of the penalties authorized under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Before an order under this subsection becomes effective, it shall be immediately submitted to the President who may, within 10 days after receiving it, disapprove the order if the President finds that disapproval is required for reasons of the national defense or the foreign policy of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assessment procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until a matter is referred to the Attorney General, the Commission may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, assess each civil penalty provided for in this chapter. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Commission shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require. The Commission may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of civil penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under this section may obtain review thereof under chapter 158 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Failure to pay assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become final or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the Commission, the Attorney General at the request of the Commission may seek to recover the amount assessed in an appropriate district court of the United States. In such an action, the court shall enforce the Commission's order unless it finds that the order was not regularly made or duly issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No penalty may be imposed on any person for conspiracy to violate section 1709(a)(1), (b)(1), or (b)(2) of this Appendix, or to defraud the Commission by concealment of such a violation. Neither the Commission nor any court shall order any person to pay the difference between the amount billed and agreed upon in writing with a common carrier or its agent and the amount set forth in any tariff or service contract by that common carrier for the transportation service provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each proceeding to assess a civil penalty under this section shall be commenced within 5 years from the date the violation occurred.</p>
