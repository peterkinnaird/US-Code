<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Deemed date of enactment for certain purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of determining whether one provision of law supersedes another based on enactment later in time, and otherwise to ensure that this Act makes no substantive change in existing law, the date of enactment of a provision restated in section 1 or 2 of this Act is deemed to remain unchanged, continuing to be the date of enactment of the underlying provision of public law that is being restated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Inconsistent laws enacted after March</cap-smallcap> 31, 2002.&mdash;This Act restates certain laws enacted before April 1, 2002. Any law enacted after March 31, 2002, that is inconsistent with this Act, including any law purporting to amend or repeal a provision that is repealed by this Act, supersedes this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>References</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A reference to a law replaced by section 1 or 2 of this Act, including a reference in a regulation, order, or other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding provision enacted by this Act.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(f) <cap-smallcap>Inferences</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An inference of a legislative construction is not to be drawn by reason of the location in the United States Code of a provision enacted by this Act or by reason of a caption or catch line of the provision.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(g) <cap-smallcap>Severability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a provision enacted by this Act is held invalid, all valid provisions that are severable from the invalid provision remain in effect.

<p class="note-body">This section is added to provide an accurate literal translation of the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;, meaning the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. In the positive law codification of title 40, most of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is restated as subtitle I of title 40. However, title III of the Act, which is outside the scope of the positive law codification, remains classified to the United States Code as 41 U.S.C. 251 et seq. Where the words &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; are restated, substituting the words &ldquo;this subtitle&rdquo; does not yield an accurate literal translation because &ldquo;this subtitle&rdquo; does not include title III of the Act.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>General Requirements</em>. To ensure the effective and economical use of America's real property and public land assets, establish a focal point for the enunciation of clear and consistent Federal policies regarding the acquisition, management, and disposal of properties, and assure management accountability for implementing Federal real property management reforms, all Executive departments and agencies shall take immediate action to recognize the importance of such resources through increased management attention, establishment of clear goals and objectives, improved policies and levels of accountability, and other appropriate actions.

<p class="note-body">Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to <!-- PDFPage:16 -->the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) [now 40 U.S.C. 121(a)] and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been permanently replaced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may make a finding that it is appropriate to terminate the contract for convenience. The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head of any department or agency that contracts with the contractor.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of the contracting department or agency may object to the termination for convenience of a contract or contracts of a contractor determined to have permanently replaced legally striking employees. If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract or contracts in a response in writing to the Secretary. In such case, the termination for convenience shall not be issued. The head of the contracting agency or department shall report to the Secretary those contracts that have been terminated for convenience under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may debar the contractor, thereby making the contractor ineligible to receive government contracts. The Secretary shall notify the Administrator of the General Services Administration of the debarment, and the Administrator shall include the contractor on the consolidated list of debarred contractors. Departments and agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of the agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that there is a compelling reason for such action, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The scope of the debarment normally will be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary finds to have permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The period of the debarment may not extend beyond the date when the labor dispute precipitating the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers has been resolved, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. The Secretary shall publish or cause to be published, in the Federal Register, the names of contractors that have, in the judgement of the Secretary, permanently replaced lawfully striking employees and have been the subject of debarment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. The Secretary shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, may adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary's functions under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. The Secretary may delegate any function or duty of the Secretary under this order to any officer in the Department of Labor or to any other officer in the executive branch of the Government, with the consent of the head of the department or agency in which that officer serves.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall take whatever action is appropriate to implement the provisions of this order and of any related rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. The meaning of the term &ldquo;organizational unit of a Federal contractor&rdquo; as used in this order shall be defined in regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with affected agencies. This order shall apply only to contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 12. (a) The provisions of section 3 of this order shall only apply to situations in which contractors have permanently replaced lawfully striking employees after the effective date of this order.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services&mdash;the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment au<!-- PDFPage:21 -->thority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(2), the words &ldquo;the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended&rdquo;, and the text of 40:484(k)(4)(D), are omitted because the relevant provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 App.:1611 et seq.) have been repealed.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public <!-- PDFPage:55 -->health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.</p>
<p class="note-body">All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>

In order to make the Federal use of work space (including office space, warehouses and special purpose space, whether federally owned, leased or controlled) and related furnishings more effective in support of agency missions, minimize the acquisition of government resources, and reduce the administrative costs of the Federal government, the heads of all Federal Executive agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Establish programs to reduce the amount of work space, used or held, to that amount which is essential for known agency missions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Ensure that the amount of office space used by each employee of the agency, or others using agency-controlled space, is held to the minimum necessary to accomplish the task that must be performed;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Manage the furniture, equipment, decoration, drapes, carpeting, plants and other accoutrements so that the use of all furnishings by the agency reflects a judicious employment of public moneys;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Consider, in making decisions concerning the use, acquisition, or disposal of work space and related furnishings, the effects of its actions on costs incurred by other Federal agencies;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Report all vacant work space retained for future Federal uses to the Administrator of General Services so that it may be made available for the temporary use of other Federal agencies, to the extent consistent with national defense requirements;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:57 --><p class="note-body">(g) Establish a work space management plan to meet the provisions of this Order, including specification of the goals to be achieved and actions to be taken by the agency in order to improve its utilization of all work space and related furnishings; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls and conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator of General Services, so that a government-wide reporting system may be developed.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Administrator of General Services is delegated authority, to the extent not prohibited by other laws, to conduct surveys, establish agency-wide objectives for work space use for each Executive agency, and establish procedures, guidelines and regulations to be followed by the agencies in developing the work space planning, information and reporting systems required by this Order.</p>

Sections 3 and 4 of the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92&ndash;313, 86 Stat. 218) added subsection (j) of 40:490 (in which the words &ldquo;the fund&rdquo; appear) and amended subsection (f) to create a fund into which &ldquo;charges made pursuant to subsection (j)&rdquo; are deposited (40:490(f)(1)(A)).

Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 does not contain a subsection (j) and the intended reference was probably &ldquo;section 210(j)&rdquo;, which is restated in this section.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Purpose and general policy</em>. (a) The purpose of these regulations is to establish policies and procedures under which interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems may be established, operated, curtailed, or discontinued.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Administrator of General Services (hereinafter referred to as the Administrator) shall establish and provide for the operation of interagency motor-vehicle pools and systems for the purpose of providing more efficient or economical transportation of Government personnel and property within specific areas by motor vehicles or local transit systems. Pools or systems based in whole or in part upon use of privately-owned vehicles and facilities shall be preferred to Government ownership of vehicles and facilities to the extent that it is feasible to provide required motor-vehicle services of satisfactory quality and cost from commercial or other private sources.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Conduct of studies to determine advisability of establishing motor-vehicle pools or systems</em>. (a) The Administrator shall select areas in which studies are to be conducted to determine the advisability of establishing motor-vehicle pools or systems. Before initiating any such study, he shall give at least thirty days notice to the head of each executive agency (as defined in section 3(a) of the Act [now 40 U.S.C. 102(4)]). The notice shall include a statement of the approximate geographic area to be studied and the date on which the study will begin.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of each executive agency receiving notice that such a study is to be made shall provide infor<!-- PDFPage:64 -->mation which is required or pertinent. He shall also designate one or more officials in the field with whom members of a staff assigned by the General Services Administration may consult. Such designated officials shall provide such assigned staff with needed information and assistance, including reasonable opportunities to observe motor-vehicle operations and facilities and to examine pertinent cost and other records.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Determination to establish an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system</em>. (a) If the Administrator determines, with due regard to the program activities of the agencies concerned, and on the basis of a study made in accordance with section 2 hereof, that an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system should be established, he shall be responsible for preparing a formal determination to that effect. Such determination shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A description of the proposed operation, including a statement of the types of service and of the geographic area, and the agencies or parts of agencies to be served.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The name of the executive agency designated to be responsible for operating the pool or system, and the reasons for such designation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) A statement indicating the motor vehicles and related equipment and supplies to be transferred and the amount of reimbursement, if any, to be made therefor.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Each determination shall be accompanied by an analytical justification which shall include a comparison of estimated costs of the present and proposed methods of operation and a showing of the estimated savings to be realized through the establishment of the proposed pool or system. The justification shall also describe the alternatives considered in making the determination, and shall include a statement concerning the availability of privately-owned facilities and equipment, and the feasibility and estimated cost (immediate and long-term) of using such facilities and equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Administrator shall send a copy of each determination to each executive agency affected and to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget [now the Director of the Office of Management and Budget] (hereinafter referred to as the Director).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Transfers of records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations</em>. Whenever the Administrator prepares a determination as set forth in section 3 of these regulations, he shall also prepare and present to the Director a schedule of the proposed transfer of such records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations as relate primarily to the functions which are to be transferred to the interagency motor-vehicle pool or system. A copy of such schedule shall be sent by the Administrator to each executive agency affected. The Director shall determine the records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations to be transferred.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Taking effect of determinations</em>. Unless a greater time is allowed therein, any determination made by the Administrator shall become binding on all affected executive agencies forty-five days after the issuance thereof except with respect to any agency which appeals, or requests an exemption, from any such determination in accordance with section 6 of these regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Review of determinations not agreed to by agencies affected</em>. (a) Any executive agency may appeal or request exemption from any or all proposals affecting it which are contained in a determination. Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Director with a copy to the Administrator within forty-five days from the date of the determination. Such appeals shall be accompanied by factual and objective supporting data and justification.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Director shall review any determination from which an executive agency has appealed and shall make a final decision on such appeal. The Director shall make such decisions, within seventy-five days after he receives the appeal or as soon thereafter as practicable, on the basis of information contained in the Administrator's determination, the executive agencies&rsquo; appeals therefrom, and any supplementary data submitted by the Administrator and the contesting agencies. The Director shall send copies of decisions to the Administrator and to the heads of other executive agencies concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Director's decision upon each such appeal, if it holds that the determination shall apply in whole or in part to the appealing agency, shall state the extent to which the determination applies and the effective date of its application. To the extent that the Director's decision on an appeal does not uphold the Administrator's determination, such determination shall be of no force and effect.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Compliance with determinations and decisions on appeals</em>. (a) When a determination or a decision on an appeal made in accordance with these regulations has become effective, each executive agency affected shall comply therewith.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Director shall take such actions as he deems appropriate to assist in securing compliance with determinations which have become effective. In the exercise of this authority to establish reserves in apportioning appropriations and funds, the Director shall take account of such savings as accrue from the establishment of inter-agency motor-vehicle pools and systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The executive agency which operates any pool or system established hereunder shall maintain accurate records of the cost of establishment, maintenance, and operation of any interagency motor-vehicle pool or system established pursuant to these regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining adequate reviews and controls of the economy and efficiency of all pools or systems established in accordance with these regulations, including those not directly operated by the General Services Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Discontinuance or curtailment of service</em>. (a) If, during any reasonable period, not exceeding two successive fiscal years, no actual savings are realized from the operation of any pool or system established hereunder, the Administrator shall discontinue the pool or system concerned.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Administrator may discontinue or curtail a motor-vehicle pool or system when he determines that it is not the most economical method of rendering required motor-vehicle service; but he shall give at least sixty days notice of such intention to executive agencies affected and to the Director before taking such action.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Executive agencies affected by a pool or system for which the Administrator is responsible (including inter-agency pools or systems operated by another executive agency designated by the Administrator) may bring problems of service and cost to the attention of the Administrator, who shall assure that such problems receive proper attention.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Executive agencies receiving motor-vehicle services from an interagency motor-vehicle pool or system under these regulations may request discontinuance or curtailment of their participation in such pool or system after at least one year of participation or in the event that the need for the services from the pool or system ceases. Such requests shall be submitted to the Administrator with pertinent factual justification.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) If the Administrator does not agree with such request and is unable to make arrangements which are mutually acceptable to him and to the head of the executive agency concerned, the agency's request for discontinuance or modification and the Administrator's reasons for not agreeing with the request shall be forwarded to the Director who shall be responsible for making a final and binding decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) When a pool or system is discontinued or curtailed, such transfers of vehicles and related equipment and supplies, personnel, records, facilities, and funds as may be appropriate will be made, subject to the approval of the Director.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>Motor vehicles exempted from inclusion in interagency motor-vehicle pools</em>. The following-described classes of motor vehicles shall be exempt from inclusion in interagency motor-vehicle pools or systems:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:65 --><p class="note-body">(1) Motor vehicles designed or used for military field training, combat, or tactical purposes, or used principally within the confines of a regularly established military post, camp, or depot.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Any motor vehicle regularly used by an agency in the performance of investigative, law enforcement, or intelligence duties if the head of such agency determines that exclusive control of such vehicle is essential to the effective performance of such duties: <em>Provided</em>, that vehicles regularly used for common administrative purposes not directly connected with the performance of law enforcement, investigative, or intelligence duties shall not because of such use be exempted from such inclusion.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Any motor vehicle the conspicuous identification of which as a Government vehicle would interfere with the purpose for which it is acquired and used.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Unless inclusion is mutually agreed upon by the Administrator and the head of the agency concerned:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Actions of administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the President, on the recommendation of the Administrator of General Services, or the federal agency having control of any real property the agency acquires that is located outside of the District of Columbia, other than military or naval reservations, declares the property to be surplus to the needs of the agency, the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may assign space in the property to any federal agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) pending a sale, may lease the property for not more than 5 years and on terms the Administrator considers to be in the public interest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may sell the property at public sale to the highest responsible bidder on terms and after public advertisement that the Administrator considers to be in the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Review of decision to assign space</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the federal agency to which space is assigned does not desire to occupy the space, the decision of the Administrator under paragraph (1)(A) is subject to review by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Negotiated sale</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If no bids which are satisfactory as to price and responsibility of the bidder are received as a result of public advertisement, the Administrator may sell the property by negotiation, on terms as may be considered to be to the best interest of the Government, but at a price not less than that bid by the highest responsible bidder.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Demolition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may demolish any building declared to be surplus to the needs of the Government under this section on deciding that demolition will be in the best interest of the Government. Before proceeding with the demolition, the Administrator shall inform the Secretary of the Interior in writing of the Administrator's intention to demolish the building, and shall not proceed with the demolition until receiving written notice from the Secretary that the building is not an historic building of national significance within the meaning of the Act of August 21, 1935 (16 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (known as the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act). If the Secretary does not notify the Administrator of the Secretary's decision as to whether the building is an historic building of national significance within 90 days of the receipt of the notice of intention to demolish the building, the Administrator may proceed to demolish the building.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Repairs and Alterations to Assigned Real Property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the Administrator, after investigation, decides that real property referred to in subsection (b) should be used for the accommodation of a federal agency, the Administrator may make any repairs or alterations that the Administrator considers necessary or advisable and may maintain and operate the property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Payment by Federal Agencies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Assigned real property</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent that the appropriations of the General Services Administration not otherwise allocated are inadequate for repairs, alterations, maintenance, or operation, the Administrator may require each federal agency to which space has been assigned to pay promptly by check to the Administrator out of its appropriation for rent any part of the estimated or actual cost of the repairs, alterations, maintenance, and operation. Payment may be either in advance of, or on or during, occupancy of the space.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Leased spaces</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To the extent that the appropriations of the Administration not otherwise required are inadequate, the Administrator may require each federal agency to which leased space has been assigned to pay promptly by check to the Administrator out of its available appropriations any part of the estimated cost of rent, repairs, alterations, maintenance, operation, and moving. Payment may be either in advance or during occupancy of the space. When space in a building is occupied by two or more agencies, the Administrator shall determine and equitably apportion rental, operation, and other charges on the basis of the total amount of space leased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Necessary amounts may be appropriated to cover the costs incident to the sale or lease of real property, or authorized demolition of buildings on the property, declared to be surplus to the needs of any federal agency under this section, and the care, maintenance, and protection of the property, including pay of employees, travel of Government employees, brokers&rsquo; fees not in excess of rates paid for similar services in the community where the property is situated, appraisals, photographs, surveys, evidence of title <!-- PDFPage:75 -->and perfecting of defective titles, advertising, and telephone and telegraph charges. However, the agency remains responsible for the proper care, maintenance, and protection of the property until the Administrator assumes custody or other disposition of the property is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may prescribe regulations as necessary to carry out this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13006, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26071, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 <em>et seq</em>.) and the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2505) [title I of Pub. L. 94&ndash;541, see Tables for classification], and in furtherance of and consistent with Executive Order No. 12072 of August 16, 1978 [40 U.S.C. 121 note], and Executive Order No. 11593 of May 13, 1971 [16 U.S.C. 470 note], it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Statement of Policy</em>. Through the Administration's community empowerment initiatives, the Federal Government has undertaken various efforts to revitalize our central cities, which have historically served as the centers for growth and commerce in our metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Administration hereby reaffirms the commitment set forth in Executive Order No. 12072 to strengthen our Nation's cities by encouraging the location of Federal facilities in our central cities. The Administration also reaffirms the commitments set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act to provide leadership in the preservation of historic resources, and in the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 to acquire and utilize space in suitable buildings of historic, architectural, or cultural significance.</p>
<p class="note-body">To this end, the Federal Government shall utilize and maintain, wherever operationally appropriate and economically prudent, historic properties and districts, especially those located in our central business areas. When implementing these policies, the Federal Government shall institute practices and procedures that are sensible, understandable, and compatible with current authority and that impose the least burden on, and provide the maximum benefit to, society.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Encouraging the Location of Federal Facilities on Historic Properties in Our Central Cities</em>. When operationally appropriate and economically prudent, and subject to the requirements of section 601 of title VI of the Rural Development Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3122) [now 7 U.S.C. 2204b&ndash;1], and Executive Order No. 12072, when locating Federal facilities, Federal agencies shall give first consideration to historic properties within historic districts. If no such property is suitable, then Federal agencies shall consider other developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts. Federal agencies shall then consider historic properties outside of historic districts, if no suitable site within a district exists. Any rehabilitation or construction that is undertaken pursuant to this order must be architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding historic district or properties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Identifying and Removing Regulatory Barriers</em>. Federal agencies with responsibilities for leasing, acquiring, locating, maintaining, or managing Federal facilities or with responsibilities for the planning for, or managing of, historic resources shall take steps to reform, streamline, and otherwise minimize regulations, policies, and procedures that impede the Federal Government's ability to establish or maintain a presence in historic districts or to acquire historic properties to satisfy Federal space needs, unless such regulations, policies, and procedures are designed to protect human health and safety or the environment. Federal agencies are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation when taking these steps.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Improving Preservation Partnerships</em>. In carrying out the authorities of the National Historic Preservation Act, the Secretary of the Interior, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and each Federal agency shall seek appropriate partnerships with States, local governments, Indian tribes, and appropriate private organizations with the goal of enhancing participation of these parties in the National Historic Preservation Program. Such partnerships should embody the principles of administrative flexibility, reduced paperwork, and increased service to the public.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) establish clear accountability for information resources management activities by creating agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) with the visibility and management responsibilities necessary to advise the agency head on the design, development, and implementation of those information systems. These responsibilities include: (1) participating in the investment review process for information systems; (2) monitoring and evaluating the performance of those information systems on the basis of applicable performance measures; and, (3) as necessary, advising the agency head to modify or terminate those systems;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) 1965 <cap-smallcap>Findings and Purpose.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds and declares that the Appalachian region of the United States, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of the Nation in its economic growth and that its people have not shared properly in the Nation's prosperity. The region's uneven past development, with its historical reliance on a few basic industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the economic base that is a vital prerequisite for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. State and local governments and the people of the region understand their problems and have been working, and will continue to work, purposefully toward their solution. Congress recognizes the comprehensive report of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission documenting these findings and concludes that regionwide development is feasible, desirable, and urgently needed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the region in meeting its special problems, to promote its economic development, and to establish a framework for joint federal and state efforts toward providing the basic facilities essential to its growth and attacking its common problems and meeting its common needs on a coordinated and concerted regional basis. The public investments made in the region under this subtitle shall be concentrated in areas where there is a significant potential for future growth and where the expected return on public dollars invested will be the greatest. States will be responsible for recommending local and state projects within their borders that will receive assistance under this subtitle. As the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources, Congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry and that the region will then be able to support itself through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) 1975 <cap-smallcap>Findings and Purpose.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the purposes set out in subsection (a), especially with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region but also its relationship to a nation that on December 31, 1975, is assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia as of December 31, 1975, has the opportunity, in accommodating future growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and coordinated planning so that housing, public services, transportation and other community facilities will be provided in a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of life for the people of the region, and consistent with that goal, the Appalachian region should be able to take advantage of eco-industrial development, which promotes both employment and economic growth and the preservation of natural resources. Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring in national energy requirements and production, which not only risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs to the region and its people.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:183 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is also the purpose of this subtitle to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state and local efforts toward&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by federal, state, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation's energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, community facilities, and human services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) 1998 <cap-smallcap>Findings and Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made in fulfilling many of the objectives of this subtitle, rapidly changing national and global economies over the decade ending November 13, 1998, have created new problems and challenges for rural areas throughout the United States and especially for the Appalachian region.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the purposes stated in subsections (a) and (b), it is the purpose of this subtitle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to assist the Appalachian region in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) providing the infrastructure necessary for economic and human resource development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) developing the region's industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) building entrepreneurial communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) generating a diversified regional economy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) making the region's industrial and commercial resources more competitive in national and world markets;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state, and local initiatives to respond to the economic competitiveness challenges in the Appalachian region through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) improving the skills of the region's workforce;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) adapting and applying new technologies for the region's businesses, including eco-industrial development technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) improving the access of the region's businesses to the technical and financial resources necessary to development of the businesses; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to address the needs of severely and persistently distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus special attention on the areas of greatest need so as to provide a fairer opportunity for the people of the region to share the quality of life generally enjoyed by citizens across the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) means any federal grant program that provides assistance for the acquisition or development of land, the construction or equipment of facilities, or other community or economic development or economic adjustment activities, including a federal grant program authorized by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) (known as the Clean Water Act);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) title VI of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 291 et seq.);</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To enable the people, States, and local communities of the Appalachian region, including local development districts, to take maximum advantage of federal grant programs for which they are eligible but for which, because of their economic situation, they cannot supply the required matching share, or for which there are insufficient amounts available under the federal law authorizing the programs to meet pressing needs of the region, the Federal Cochairman may use amounts made available to carry out this section&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Certification Required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For a program, project, or activity for which any part of the basic federal contribution to the project or activity under a federal grant program is proposed to be made under subsection (b), the contribution shall not be made until the responsible federal official administering the federal law authorizing the contribution certifies that the program, project, or activity meets the applicable requirements of the federal law and could be approved for federal contribution under that law if amounts were available under the law for the program, project, or activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Limitations in Other Laws Inapplicable</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts provided pursuant to this subtitle are available without regard to any limitations on areas eligible for assistance or authorizations for appropriation in any other law.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than two-thirds of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) federal legislation is necessary under section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this chapter is to adopt standards governing arbitration that must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower op<!-- PDFPage:213 -->erating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;public welfare&rdquo; includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing public transit services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered under that arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions that provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Factors in Making Arbitration Award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the continuity and stability of employment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The public welfare.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Ability To Finance Salaries and Benefits Provided in Award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction that provides subsidy payments or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Final Award.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Written award</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (b) and (c) have been considered and applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Prerequisites</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours <!-- PDFPage:214 -->of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Substantial evidence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The arbitrator's conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Judicial Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may bring a civil action in a court that has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award.
