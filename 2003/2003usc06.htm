<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13231, Oct. 16, 2001, 66 F.R. 53063, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13284, &sect;2, Jan. 23, 2003, 68 F.R. 4075; Ex. Ord. No. 13286, &sect;7, Feb. 28, 2003, 68 F.R. 10620, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure protection of information systems for critical infrastructure, including emergency preparedness communications and the physical assets that support such systems, in the information age, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. The information technology revolution has changed the way business is transacted, government operates, and national defense is conducted. Those three functions now depend on an interdependent network of critical information infrastructures. It is the policy of the United States to protect against disruption of the operation of information systems for critical infrastructure and thereby help to protect the people, economy, essential human and government services, and national security of the United States, and to ensure that any disruptions that occur are infrequent, of minimal duration, and manageable, and cause the least damage possible. The implementation of this policy shall include a voluntary public-private partnership, involving corporate and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Continuing Authorities</em>. This order does not alter the existing authorities or roles of United States Government departments and agencies. Authorities set forth in 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and other applicable law, provide senior officials with responsibility for the security of Federal Government information systems.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Executive Branch Information Systems Security. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has the responsibility to develop and oversee the implementation of government-wide policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of information systems that support the executive branch departments and agencies, except those noted in section 2(b) of this order. The Director of OMB shall advise the President and the appropriate department or agency head when there is a critical deficiency in the security practices within the purview of this section in an executive branch department or agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) National Security Information Systems. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) shall have responsibility to oversee, develop, and ensure implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of information systems that support the operations under their respective control. In consultation with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the affected departments and agencies, the Secretary of Defense and the DCI shall develop policies, principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of national security information systems that support the operations of other executive branch departments and agencies with national security information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) Policies, principles, standards, and guidelines developed under this subsection may require more stringent protection than those developed in accordance with section 2(a) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall advise the President and the appropriate department or agency when there is a critical deficiency in the security practices of a department or agency within the purview of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) National Security Systems. The National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee, as established by and consistent with NSD&ndash;42 and chaired by the Department of Defense, shall be designated as the &ldquo;Committee on National Security Systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Additional Responsibilities. The heads of executive branch departments and agencies are responsible and accountable for providing and maintaining adequate levels of security for information systems, including emergency preparedness communications systems, for programs under their control. Heads of such departments and agencies shall ensure the development and, within available appropriations, funding of pro<!-- PDFPage:17 -->grams that adequately address these mission systems, especially those critical systems that support the national security and other essential government programs. Additionally, security should enable, and not unnecessarily impede, department and agency business operations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>The National Infrastructure Advisory Council</em>. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), established on October 16, 2001, shall provide the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security with advice on the security of information systems for critical infrastructure supporting other sectors of the economy: banking and finance, transportation, energy, manufacturing, and emergency government services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Membership. The NIAC shall be composed of not more than 30 members appointed by the President. The members of the NIAC shall be selected from the private sector, academia, and State and local government. Members of the NIAC shall have expertise relevant to the functions of the NIAC and generally shall be selected from industry Chief Executive Officers (and equivalently ranked leaders of other organizations) with responsibilities for security of information infrastructure supporting the critical sectors of the economy, including banking and finance, transportation, energy, communications, and emergency government services. Members shall not be full-time officials or employees of the executive branch of the Federal Government. The President shall designate a Chair and Vice Chair from among the members of the NIAC.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Functions of the NIAC. The NIAC will meet periodically to:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) enhance the partnership of the public and private sectors in protecting information systems for critical infrastructures and provide reports on this issue to the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) propose and develop ways to encourage private industry to perform periodic risk assessments of critical information and telecommunications systems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) monitor the development of private sector Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and provide recommendations to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security on how these organizations can best foster improved cooperation among the ISACs, the Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal Government entities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) report to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security, who shall ensure appropriate coordination with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs under the terms of this order; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(v) advise lead agencies with critical infrastructure responsibilities, sector coordinators, the Department of Homeland Security, and the ISACs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Administration of the NIAC.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) The NIAC may hold hearings, conduct inquiries, and establish subcommittees, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) Upon request of the Chair, and to the extent permitted by law, the heads of the executive departments and agencies shall provide the NIAC with information and advice relating to its functions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) Senior Federal Government officials may participate in the meetings of the NIAC, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) Members shall serve without compensation for their work on the NIAC. However, members may be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in Federal Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701&ndash;5707).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(v) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Department of Homeland Security shall provide the NIAC with administrative services, staff, and other support services, and such funds as may be necessary for the performance of the NIAC's functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) General Provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.) (Act), may apply to the NIAC, the functions of the President under that Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Department of Homeland Security in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) The NIAC shall terminate on October 15, 2003, unless extended by the President.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) Executive Order 13130 of July 14, 1999, was revoked on October 16, 2001.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iv) Nothing in this order shall supersede any requirement made by or under law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">An individual who receives a voluntary separation incentive payment under this section and who, within 5 years after the date of the separation on which the payment is based, accepts any <!-- PDFPage:52 -->compensated employment with the Government or works for any agency of the Government through a personal services contract, shall be required to pay, prior to the individual's first day of employment, the entire amount of the incentive payment. Such payment shall be made to the covered entity from which the individual separated or, if made on or after the transfer date, to the Deputy Secretary or the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security (for transfer to the appropriate component of the Department of Homeland Security, if necessary).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal cause of action</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall exist a Federal cause of action for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. The substantive law for decision in any such action shall be derived from the law, including choice of law principles, of the State in which such acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal cause of action shall be brought only for claims for injuries that are proximately caused by sellers that provide qualified anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal government customers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such appropriate district court of the United States shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for any claim for loss of property, personal injury, or death arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In an action brought under this section for damages the following provisions apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Punitive damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No punitive damages intended to punish or deter, exemplary damages, or other damages not intended to compensate a plaintiff for actual losses may be awarded, nor shall any party be liable for interest prior to the judgment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noneconomic damages</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Noneconomic damages may be awarded against a defendant only in an amount directly proportional to the percentage of responsibility of such defendant for the harm to the plaintiff, and no plaintiff may recover noneconomic damages unless the plaintiff suffered physical harm.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;noneconomic damages&rdquo; means damages for losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, and any other nonpecuniary losses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collateral sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any recovery by a plaintiff in an action under this section shall be reduced by the amount of collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff has received or is entitled to receive as a result of such acts of terrorism that result or may result in loss to the Seller.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Government contractor defense</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Should a product liability or other lawsuit be filed for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the government contractor defense applies in such lawsuit. This presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in submitting information to the Secretary during the course of the Secretary's consideration of such technology under this subsection. This presumption of the government contractor defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against the Seller arises from a sale of the product to Federal Government or non-Federal Government customers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusive responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary will be exclusively responsible for the review and approval of anti-terrorism technology for purposes of establishing a government contractor defense in any product liability lawsuit for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in this paragraph and paragraph (3), have been deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such act and such claims result or may result in loss to the Seller. Upon the Seller's submission to the Secretary for approval of anti-terrorism technology, the Secretary will conduct a comprehensive review of the design of such technology and determine whether it will perform as intended, conforms to the Seller's specifications, and is safe for use as intended. The Seller will conduct safety and hazard analyses on such technology and will supply the Secretary with all such information.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:68 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For anti-terrorism technology reviewed and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary will issue a certificate of conformance to the Seller and place the anti-terrorism technology on an Approved Product List for Homeland Security.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall in any way limit the ability of any person to seek any form of recovery from any person, government, or other entity that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in, aids and abets, or commits any act of terrorism, or any criminal act related to or resulting from such act of terrorism; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such act of terrorism or any such criminal act.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;466. Sense of Congress reaffirming the continued importance and applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 1385 of title 18 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Posse Comitatus Act&rdquo;) prohibits the use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in enforcing Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title 10 (commonly known as the &ldquo;Insurrection Act&rdquo;), and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress reaffirms the continued importance of section 1385 of title 18, and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this chapter should be construed to alter the applicability of such section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This part may be cited as the &ldquo;Homeland Security Information Sharing Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Federal Government relies on State and local personnel to protect against terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and protects classified and sensitive but unclassified information to enhance homeland security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Some homeland security information is needed by the State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected status of such information and to protect the sources and methods used to acquire such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, and local levels of government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt classified information so it may be shared with State and local personnel without the need for granting additional security clearances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) State and local personnel have capabilities and opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The Federal Government and State and local governments and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Federal, State, and local governments and intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Information systems, including the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified information among Federal, State, and local entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Increased efforts to share homeland security information should avoid duplicating existing information systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland security information to the maximum extent practicable, with special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural communities.</p>

The two tables include total funding (mandatory and discretionary including fees) and discretionary funding net of fees. The tables provide the enacted levels for 2002 and 2002 supplementals, and the President's requested levels for 2003.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Because of the current state of the 2003 budget process, information concerning the funds that will be available to each transferring agency on the date of the proposed transfers is not currently available and will not likely be available during the time period in which the President is to submit this Reorganization Plan.

The first table provides estimates of unobligated balances for the accounts that are moving to the Department in whole. The second table provides estimates of the unobligated balances in the accounts of which only a portion will be transferring to the new Department. These latter estimates, however, are of the unobligated balances for the full account, only a portion of which are associated with the activities that will be transferred to the Department. In addition, these unobligated balances are based on the Department of Treasury's estimates as of September 30, 2002, which are the latest available figures. Since October 1, 2002, Departments and agencies (except the Department of Defense) have been operating under continuing resolutions, and, as such, have been spending these balances to maintain current operations.</p>
<p class="note-body-block-1em">Authority to reallocate unexpended funds of agencies transferred under this Plan is found in H.J. Res. 124 [Pub. L. 107&ndash;294, Nov. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 2062], the continuing resolution in effect currently and until January 11, 2003. The resolution provides authority for the Office of Management and Budget to transfer an amount not to exceed $140,000,000 from unobligated balances of appropriations enacted before October 1, 2002 &ldquo;for organizations and entities that will be transferred to the new Department and for salaries and expenses associated with the initiation of the Department.&rdquo; Such authority may be exercised upon providing 15 days&rsquo; notice to the Appropriations Committees. We anticipate that it may be necessary to provide funding through such transfers both for transferring entities and for salaries and expenses associated with the initiation of the Department, including, for example, those associated with establishing the Office of the Secretary and other new offices provided for in the Act. Any plan to use such funding will follow the procedures required under the continuing resolution, including the provision of at least 15 days&rsquo; notice to the Appropriations Committees.</p>
