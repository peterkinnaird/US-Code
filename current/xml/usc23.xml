Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (referred to in this section as the “Interstate System”), so named because of its primary importance to the national defense, is essential to the national interest. It is the intent of Congress that the Interstate System be completed as nearly as practicable over the period of availability of the forty years’ appropriations authorized for the purpose of expediting its construction, reconstruction, or improvement, inclusive of necessary tunnels and bridges, through the fiscal year ending <date date="1996-09-30">September 30, 1996</date>, under section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (<ref href="/us/stat/70/374">70 Stat. 374</ref>), and that the entire system in all States be brought to simultaneous completion. Insofar as possible in consonance with this objective, existing highways located on an interstate route shall be used to the extent that such use is practicable, suitable, and feasible, it being the intent that local needs, to the extent practicable, suitable, and feasible, shall be given equal consideration with the needs of interstate commerce.</content>

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any other provision of this subsection, where a project is to be constructed (1) to provide parking garage ramps in conjunction with high occupancy vehicle lanes which flow into a distributor system emptying directly into ramps for off-street parking with preferential parking for carpools, vanpools, and buses and the ramps are part of an environmental mitigation effort and are designed to feed into an aerial walkway system, or (2) to provide a parking lot near the terminus of an Interstate System spur route which radiates from an Interstate System beltway which will be used as an intermodal transfer facility for a light rail transit project to be constructed in the median of the spur route and the parking lot is part of an environmental mitigation effort, or (3) to provide a parking garage and associated facilities as part of an intermodal transfer facility with a transit system near or within an Interstate System route right-of-way which will have direct and indirect access to the facility by way of local streets and the parking garage and associated facilities are part of an environmental mitigation effort, or (4) to provide for the comprehensive upgrading of existing high occupancy vehicle lanes, new ramps and parking facilities at mass transit intermodal transfer points on an existing Interstate System route which has temporary high occupancy vehicle lanes in the median and the parking facilities and ramps are part of an environmental mitigation effort, the costs of such parking garage ramps, parking lots, parking garages, associated interchange ramps, high occupancy vehicle lanes, and other associated work eligible under title 23, United States Code, shall be eligible for funds authorized by this subsection as if the costs for these projects were included in the 1981 interstate cost estimate and shall be included as eligible projects in any future interstate cost estimate. For purposes of this subsection, construction necessary to provide a minimum level of acceptable service on the Interstate System shall include, but not be limited to, any construction on the Interstate System which is required under a court order issued before the date of enactment of this sentence. Notwithstanding the fifth sentence of this subsection, the costs of a project which will upgrade an interstate route and will complete a gap on the Interstate System providing access to an international airport and which was described as the preferred alternative in a final environmental impact statement submitted to the Secretary of Transportation on <date date="1983-09-30">September 30, 1983</date>, shall be eligible for funds authorized by this subsection as if such costs were included in the 1981 interstate cost estimate and shall be included as eligible costs in any future interstate cost estimate, except that (1) such costs may be further developed in the design and environmental process under normal Federal-aid interstate procedures, and (2) the amount of such costs shall not include the portion of the project between High Street and Causeway Street.”</quotedContent>

L. 94–280</ref> [see 1976 Amendment notes above] as follows: <quotedContent>“Upon the joint request of a State Governor and the local governments concerned, the Secretary may withdraw his approval of any route or portion thereof on the Interstate System within any urbanized area in that State selected and approved in accordance with this title prior to the enactment of this paragraph, if he determines that such route or portion thereof is not essential to completion of a unified and connected Interstate System or will no longer be essential by reason of the application of this paragraph and will not be constructed as a part of the Interstate System, and if he receives assurances that the State does not intend to construct a toll road in the traffic corridor which would be served by such route or portion thereof. The mileage of the route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph shall be available for designation on the Interstate System in any other State in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection. After the Secretary has withdrawn his approval of any such route or portion thereof, whenever responsible local officials of such urbanized area notify the State highway department that, in lieu of a route or portion thereof approval for which is withdrawn under this paragraph, their needs require a nonhighway public mass transit project involving the construction of fixed rail facilities, or the purchase of passenger equipment, including rolling stock for any mode of mass transit, or both, and the State highway department determines that such public mass transit project is in accordance with the planning process under <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s134">section 134 of this title</ref> and is entitled to priority under such planning process, such public mass transit project shall be submitted for approval to the Secretary. Approval of the plans, specifications, and estimates for such project by the Secretary shall be deemed a contractual obligation of the United States for payment out of the general funds in the Treasury of its proportional share of the cost of such project in an amount equal to the Federal share which would be paid for such a project under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 [section 1601 et seq. of Title 49, Transportation], except that the total Federal cost of all such projects under this paragraph with respect to such route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph, shall not exceed the Federal share of the cost which would have been paid for such route or portion thereof, as such cost is included in the 1972 Interstate System cost estimate set forth in table 5 of House Public Works Committee Print Numbered 92–29, as revised in House Report Numbered 92–1443, increased or decreased, as the case may be, as determined by the Secretary, based on changes in construction costs of such route or portion thereof as of the date of withdrawal of approval under this paragraph and in accordance with that design of such route or portion thereof which is the basis of such 1972 cost estimate. Funds apportioned to such State for the Interstate System, which apportionment is based upon an Interstate System cost estimate that includes a route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Federal share of such proj­ect as such share becomes a contractual obligation of the United States. No general funds shall be obligated under authority of this paragraph after <date date="1981-06-30">June 30, 1981</date>. No nonhighway public mass transit project shall be approved under this paragraph unless the Secretary has received assurances satisfactory to him from the State that public mass transportation systems will fully utilize the proposed project. The provision of assistance under this paragraph shall not be construed as bringing within the application of chapter 15 of title 5, United States Code [section 1501 et seq. of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees], any nonsupervisory employee of an urban mass transportation system (or of any other agency or entity performing related functions) to whom such chapter is otherwise inapplicable. Funds available for expenditure to carry out the purposes of this paragraph shall be supplementary to and not in substitution for funds authorized and available for obligation pursuant to the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended [section 1601 et seq. of Title 49, Transportation]. The provisions of section 3(e)(4) of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended, [section 1602 (e)(4) of Title 49], shall apply in carrying out this paragraph.”</quotedContent>

The Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate and consult with the Secretaries of the Interior, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, and with the States in developing transportation plans and programs that include measures to maintain or enhance the natural beauty of the lands traversed. After the effective date of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, the Secretary shall not approve any program or project (other than any project for a Federal lands transportation facility) which requires the use of any publicly owned land from a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national, State, or local significance as determined by the Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction thereof, or any land from an historic site of national, State, or local significance as so determined by such officials unless (1) there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land, and (2) such program includes all possible planning to minimize harm to such park, recreational area, wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or historic site resulting from such use. In carrying out the national policy declared in this section the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and appropriate State and local officials, is authorized to conduct studies as to the most feasible Federal-aid routes for the movement of motor vehicular traffic through or around national parks so as to best serve the needs of the traveling public while preserving the natural beauty of these areas.</content>

The highway department of the State in which such dam shall be located, jointly with the Secretary, shall first determine and certify to such agency that such bridge is economically desirable and needed as a link in the State or Federal-aid highway systems, and shall request such agency to design and construct such dam so that it will serve as a suitable and adequate foundation for a public highway bridge and to design and construct such public highway bridge upon and across such dam, and shall agree to reimburse such agency pursuant to subsection (d) of this section for any additional costs which it may be required to incur because of the design and construction of such dam so that it will serve as a foundation for a public highway bridge and for expenditures which it may find it necessary to make in designing and constructing such public highway bridge upon and across such dam. In no case shall the design and construction of a bridge upon and across such dam be undertaken hereunder except by the agency having jurisdiction over and custody of the dam, acting directly or through contractors employed by it, and after such agency shall determine that it will be structurally feasible and will not interfere with the proper functioning and operation of the dam.</content>

Implementation of a highway safety program under this section shall not be construed to require the Secretary to require compliance with every uniform guideline, or with every element of every uniform guideline, in every State. A State may use the funds apportioned under this section, in cooperation with neighboring States, for highway safety programs or related projects that may confer benefits on such neighboring States. Funds apportioned under this section to any State, that does not have a highway safety program approved by the Secretary or that is not implementing an approved program, shall be reduced by amounts equal to not less than 20 percent of the amounts that would otherwise be apportioned to the State under this section, until such time as the Secretary approves such program or determines that the State is implementing an approved program, as appropriate.

<heading>Ex. Ord. No. 13513. Federal Leadership On Reducing Text Messaging While Driving</heading>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Ex. Ord. No. 13513, <date date="2009-10-01">Oct. 1, 2009</date>, 74 F.R. 51225, provided:</p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s7902/c">section 7902(c) of title 5</ref>, United States Code, and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t40/s101">40 U.S.C. 101</ref> <i>et seq</i>. [see Short Title of 1949 Act note set out under <ref href="/us/usc/t41/s101">section 101 of Title 41</ref>, Public Contracts], and in order to demonstrate Federal leadership in improving safety on our roads and highways and to enhance the efficiency of Federal contracting, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Section</inline> 1. <i>Policy</i>. With nearly 3 million civilian employees, the Federal Government can and should demonstrate leadership in reducing the dangers of text messaging while driving. Recent deadly crashes involving drivers distracted by text messaging while behind the wheel highlight a growing danger on our roads. Text messaging causes drivers to take their eyes off the road and at least one hand off the steering wheel, endangering both themselves and others. Every day, Federal employees drive Government-owned, Government-leased, or Government-rented vehicles (collectively, GOV) or privately-owned vehicles (POV) on official Government business, and some Federal employees use Government-supplied electronic devices to text or e-mail while driving. A Federal Government-wide prohibition on the use of text messaging while driving on official business or while using Government-supplied equipment will help save lives, reduce injuries, and set an example for State and local governments, private employers, and individual drivers. Extending this policy to cover Federal contractors is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Federal contractors and contractor employees who refrain from the unsafe practice of text messaging while driving in connection with Government business are less likely to experience disruptions to their operations that would adversely impact Federal procurement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 2. <i>Text Messaging While Driving by Federal Employees</i>. Federal employees shall not engage in text messaging (a) when driving GOV, or when driving POV while on official Government business, or (b) when using electronic equipment supplied by the Government while driving.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 3. <i>Scope of Order</i>. (a) All agencies of the executive branch are directed to take appropriate action within the scope of their existing programs to further the policies of this order and to implement section 2 of this order. This includes, but is not limited to, considering new rules and programs, and reevaluating existing programs to prohibit text messaging while driving, and conducting education, awareness, and other outreach for Federal employees about the safety risks associated with texting while driving. These initiatives should encourage voluntary compliance with the agency’s text messaging policy while off duty.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, each agency is directed, consistent with all applicable laws and regulations: (i) to take appropriate measures to implement this order, (ii) to adopt measures to ensure compliance with section 2 of this order, including through appropriate disciplinary actions, and (iii) to notify the Secretary of Transportation of the measures it undertakes hereunder.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(c) Agency heads may exempt from the requirements of this order, in whole or in part, certain employees, devices, or vehicles in their respective agencies that are engaged in or used for protective, law enforcement, or national security responsibilities or on the basis of other emergency conditions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 4. <i>Text Messaging While Driving by Government Contractors, Subcontractors, and Recipients and Subrecipients</i>. Each Federal agency, in procurement contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, and other grants to the extent authorized by applicable statutory authority, entered into after the date of this order, shall encourage contractors, subcontractors, and recipients and subrecipients to adopt and enforce policies that ban text messaging while driving company-owned or -rented vehicles or GOV, or while driving POV when on official Government business or when performing any work for or on behalf of the Government. Agencies should also encourage Federal contractors, subcontractors, and grant recipients and subrecipients as described in this section to conduct initiatives of the type described in section 3(a) of this order.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 5. <i>Coordination</i>. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, shall provide leadership and guidance to the heads of executive branch agencies to assist them with any action pursuant to this order.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 6. <i>Definitions</i>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(a) The term “agency” as used in this order means an executive agency, as defined in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s105">5 U.S.C. 105</ref>, except for the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) “Texting” or “Text Messaging” means reading from or entering data into any handheld or other electronic device, including for the purpose of SMS texting, e-mailing, instant messaging, obtaining navigational information, or engaging in any other form of electronic data retrieval or electronic data communication.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(c) “Driving” means operating a motor vehicle on an active roadway with the motor running, including while temporarily stationary because of traffic, a traffic light or stop sign, or otherwise. It does not include operating a motor vehicle with or without the motor running when one has pulled over to the side of, or off, an active roadway and has halted in a location where one can safely remain stationary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 7. <i>General Provisions</i>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect or alter:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(i) Authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head thereof;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(ii) Powers and duties of the heads of the various departments and agencies pursuant to the Highway Safety Act of 1966, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t23/s402">23 U.S.C. 402</ref> and 403, section 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s668">29 U.S.C. 668</ref>, sections 7901 and 7902 of title 5, United States Code, or the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t40/s101">40 U.S.C. 101</ref> <i>et seq</i>.;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(iii) Rights, duties, or procedures under the National Labor Relations Act, <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s151">29 U.S.C. 151</ref> <i>et seq</i>.; or</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(iv) Functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
