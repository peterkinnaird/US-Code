<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Person</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;person&rdquo; means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, institution, or other entity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Exclusive Property of United States.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An invention shall be the exclusive property of the United States if it is made in the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration, and the Administrator determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the person who made the invention was employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work and the invention is related to the work the person was employed or assigned to perform, or was <!-- PDFPage:17 -->within the scope of the person's employment duties, whether or not it was made during working hours, or with a contribution by the Government of the use of Government facilities, equipment, materials, allocated funds, information proprietary to the Government, or services of Government employees during working hours; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the person who made the invention was not employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work, but the invention is nevertheless related to the contract, or to the work or duties the person was employed or assigned to perform, and was made during working hours, or with a contribution from the Government of the sort referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Patent to united states</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If an invention is the exclusive property of the United States under paragraph (1), and if such invention is patentable, a patent therefor shall be issued to the United States upon application made by the Administrator, unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States to such invention in conformity with the provisions of subsection (g).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Contract Provisions for Furnishing Reports of Inventions, Discoveries, Improvements, or Innovations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each contract entered into by the Administrator with any party for the performance of any work shall contain effective provisions under which the party shall furnish promptly to the Administrator a written report containing full and complete technical information concerning any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation which may be made in the performance of any such work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Patent Application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No patent may be issued to any applicant other than the Administrator for any invention which appears to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Director&rdquo;) to have significant utility in the conduct of aeronautical and space activities unless the applicant files with the Director, with the application or within 30 days after request therefor by the Director, a written statement executed under oath setting forth the full facts concerning the circumstances under which the invention was made and stating the relationship (if any) of the invention to the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration. Copies of each such statement and the application to which it relates shall be transmitted forthwith by the Director to the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Issuance of Patent to Applicant</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon any application as to which any such statement has been transmitted to the Administrator, the Director may, if the invention is patentable, issue a patent to the applicant unless the Administrator, within 90 days after receipt of the application and statement, requests that the patent be issued to the Administrator on behalf of the United States. If, within such time, the Administrator files such a request with the Director, the Director shall transmit notice thereof to the applicant, and shall issue such patent to the Administrator unless the applicant within 30 days after receipt of the notice requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether the Administrator is entitled under this section to receive the patent. The Board may hear and determine, in accordance with rules and procedures established for interference cases, the question so presented, and its determination shall be subject to appeal by the applicant or by the Administrator to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with procedures governing appeals from decisions of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in other proceedings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Subsequent Transfer of Patent in Case of False Representations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever a patent has been issued to an applicant in conformity with subsection (e), and the Administrator thereafter has reason to believe that the statement filed by the applicant in connection with the patent contained a false representation of a material fact, the Administrator, within 5 years after the date of issuance of the patent, may file with the Director a request for the transfer to the Administrator of title to the patent on the records of the Director. Notice of any such request shall be transmitted by the Director to the owner of record of the patent, and title to the patent shall be so transferred to the Administrator unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice, the owner of record requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether any such false representation was contained in the statement filed in connection with the patent. The question shall be heard and determined, and the determination shall be subject to review, in the manner prescribed by subsection (e) for questions arising thereunder. A request made by the Administrator under this subsection for the transfer of title to a patent, and prosecution for the violation of any criminal statute, shall not be barred by the failure of the Administrator to make a request under subsection (e) for the issuance of the patent to the Administrator, or by any notice previously given by the Administrator stating that the Administrator had no objection to the issuance of the patent to the applicant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Waiver of Rights to Inventions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under such regulations in conformity with this subsection as the Administrator shall prescribe, the Administrator may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States under this section with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or which may be made by any person or class of persons in the performance of any work required by any contract of the Administration if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served thereby. Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the interests of the United States. Each such waiver made with respect to any invention shall be subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty <!-- PDFPage:18 -->or agreement with the United States. Each proposal for any waiver under this subsection shall be referred to an Inventions and Contributions Board which shall be established by the Administrator within the Administration. Such Board shall accord to each interested party an opportunity for hearing, and shall transmit to the Administrator its findings of fact with respect to such proposal and its recommendations for action to be taken with respect thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Protection of Title</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator is authorized to take all suitable and necessary steps to protect any invention or discovery to which the Administrator has title, and to require contractors or persons who retain title to inventions or discoveries under this section to protect the inventions or discoveries to which the Administration has or may acquire a license of use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Administration as Defense Agency</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administration shall be considered a defense agency of the United States for the purpose of chapter 17 of title 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Objects Intended for Launch, Launched, or Assembled in Outer Space</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any object intended for launch, launched, or assembled in outer space shall be considered a vehicle for the purpose of section 272 of title 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) <cap-smallcap>Use or Manufacture of Patented Inventions Incorporated in Space Vehicles Launched for Persons Other Than United States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The use or manufacture of any patented invention incorporated in a space vehicle launched by the United States Government for a person other than the United States shall not be considered to be a use or manufacture by or for the United States within the meaning of section 1498(a) of title 28, unless the Administration gives an express authorization or consent for such use or manufacture.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Exclusive Remedy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672 of title 28, for damages for personal injury, including death, caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any physician, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, or paramedical or other supporting personnel (including medical and dental technicians, nursing assistants, and therapists) of the Administration in the performance of medical, dental, or related health care functions (including clinical studies and investigations) while acting within the scope of such person's duties or employment therein or therefor shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject matter against such person (or the estate of such person) whose act or omission gave rise to the action or proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Attorney General To Defend any Civil Action or Proceeding for Malpractice or Negligence</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General shall defend any civil action or proceeding brought in any court against any person referred to in subsection (a) (or the estate of such person) for any such injury. Any such person against whom such civil action or proceeding is brought shall deliver within such time after date of service or knowledge of service as determined by the Attorney General, all process served upon such person or an attested true copy thereof to such person's immediate superior or to whomever was designated by the Administrator to receive such papers. Such person shall promptly furnish copies of the pleading and process therein to the United States Attorney for the district embracing the place wherein the proceeding is brought, to the Attorney General, and to the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Removal of Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon a certification by the Attorney General that any person described in subsection (a) was acting in the scope of such person's duties or employment at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose, any such civil action or proceeding commenced in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States of the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending and the proceeding deemed a tort action brought against the United States under the provisions of title 28, and all references thereto. Should a district court of the United States determine, on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merits, that the case so removed is one in which a remedy by suit within the meaning of subsection (a) is not available against the United States, the case shall be remanded to the State court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Compromise or Settlement of Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Attorney General may compromise or settle any claim asserted in such civil action or proceeding in the manner provided in section 2677 of title 28, and with the same effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Applicability of Other Provisions of Law</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section, the provisions of section 2680(h) of title 28 shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical, dental, or related health care functions (including clinical studies and investigations).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Liability Insurance for Persons Assigned to Foreign Countries or Non-Federal Agencies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator or the Administrator's designee may, to the extent that the Administrator or the designee deems appropriate, hold harmless or provide liability insurance for any person described in subsection (a) for damages for personal injury, including death, caused by such person's negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical, dental, or related health care functions (including clinical studies and investigations) while acting within the scope of such person's duties if such person is assigned to a foreign country or detailed for service with other than a Federal department, agency, or instrumentality or if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third persons against the United States described in section 2679(b) of title 28, for such damage or injury.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, May 3, 2010, 75 F.R. 24781, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense[,] the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[,] the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development[,] the Secretary of Transportation[,] the Secretary of Education[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Administrator of the Small Business Administration[,] the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration[,] the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers[,] the Director of National Intelligence[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[, and] the Director of the National Economic Council</p>
<p class="note-body">My Administration is committed to implementing a bold, new approach to human spaceflight. Supported by a $6 billion increase to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) budget over the next 5 years, this strategy will foster the development of path-breaking technologies, increase the reach and reduce the cost of human and robotic exploration of space, and help create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p class="note-body">NASA's budget also includes $429 million next year, and $1.9 billion over the next 5 years, to modernize the Kennedy Space Center and other nearby space launch facilities in Florida. This modernization effort will help spur new commercial business and innovation and provide additional good jobs to the region. While all of the new aspects of my Administration's plan together will create thousands of new jobs in Florida, past decisions to end the Space Shuttle program will still affect families and communities along Florida's &ldquo;Space Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Building on this significant new investment at the Kennedy Space Center and my increased budget for NASA overall, I am committed to taking additional steps to help local economies like Florida's Space Coast adapt and thrive in the years ahead. The men and women who work in Florida's aerospace industry are some of the most talented and highly trained in the Nation. It is critical that their skills are tapped as we transform and expand the country's space exploration efforts. That is why I am launching a $40 million, multi-agency initiative to help the Space Coast transform their economies and prepare their workers for the opportunities of tomorrow. This effort will build on and complement ongoing local and Federal economic and workforce-development efforts through a Task Force composed of senior-level Administration officials from relevant agencies that will construct an economic development action plan by August 15, 2010.</p>
<p class="note-body">To these ends, I hereby direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Establishment of the Task Force on Space Industry Workforce and Economic Development</em>.

The Task Force shall work with local stakeholders and executive departments and agencies to equip Space Coast and other affected workers to take advantage of new opportunities and expand the region's economic base.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Task Force will perform the following functions, to the extent permitted by law:</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) describes how the plan will build on and complement ongoing economic and workforce development efforts;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) explores future workforce and economic development activities that could be undertaken for affected aerospace communities in other States, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) identifies areas of collaboration with other public or nongovernmental actors to achieve the objectives of the Task Force; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) details a coordinated implementation strategy by executive departments and agencies to meet the objectives of the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Termination</em>. The Task Force shall terminate 3 years after the date of this memorandum unless extended by the President.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>General Provisions</em>.

Each executive department and agency shall bear its own expense for participating in the Task Force; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or</p>

Congress further declares that free and competitive markets create the most efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and should therefore govern the economic development of Earth orbital space. Congress further declares that the use of free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce Space Station operational costs for all partners and the Federal Government's share of the United States burden to fund operations.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Congressional intent</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the intent of Congress that funding for the program described in paragraph (1)(D) shall not come at the expense of full funding of the amounts authorized under section 101(3)(A) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110&ndash;422, 122 Stat. 4783), and for future fiscal years, for Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle development, Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle development, or International Space Station cargo delivery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Additional technologies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administration shall make International Space Station-compatible docking adaptors and other relevant technologies available to the commercial crew providers selected to service the International Space Station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Crew transfer and crew rescue services contract</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a commercial provider demonstrates the capability to provide International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue services and to satisfy Administration ascent, entry, and International Space Station proximity operations safety requirements, the Administration shall enter into an International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue services contract with that commercial provider for a portion of the Administration's anticipated International Space Station crew transfer and crew rescue requirements from the time the commercial provider commences operations under contract with the Administration through calendar year 2016, with an option to extend the period of performance through calendar year 2020.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;248, title IX, &sect;902, Oct. 23, 2002, 116 Stat. 1573, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is in the national interest to encourage the production of cost-effective, in-space transportation systems, which would be built and operated by the private sector on a commercial basis.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The use of reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance performance levels of in-space operations, enhance efficient and safe disposal of satellites at the end of their useful lives, and increase the capability and reliability of existing ground-to-space launch vehicles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will enhance the economic well-being and national security of the United States by reducing space operations costs for commercial and national space programs and by adding new space capabilities to space operations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems will provide new cost-effective space capabilities (including orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high altitude orbits and return, the correction of erroneous satellite orbits, and the recovery, refurbishment, and refueling of satellites) and the provision of upper stage functions to increase ground-to-orbit launch vehicle payloads to geostationary and other high energy orbits.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival deceleration to support potential National Aeronautics and Space Administration missions to Mars, Pluto, and other planets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbit due to deficiencies in their launch represent substantial economic loss to the United States and present substantial concerns for the current backlog of national space assets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can provide new options for alternative planning approaches and risk management to enhance the mission assurance of national space assets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems developed by the private sector can provide in-space transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Defense, the National Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need for the United States to bear the cost of production of such systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The availability of loan guarantees, with the cost of credit risk to the United States paid by the private-sector, is an effective means by which the United States can help qualifying private-sector companies secure otherwise unattainable private financing for the production of commercial reusable in-space transportation systems, while at the same time minimizing Government commitment and involvement in the development of such systems.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the peaceful uses of outer space continue to be of great value and to offer benefits to all mankind;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private applications of space technology have achieved a significant level of commercial and economic activity and offer the potential for growth in the future, particularly in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) new and innovative equipment and services are being sought, produced, and offered by entrepreneurs in telecommunications, information services, microgravity research, human space flight, and remote sensing technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the private sector in the United States has the capability of developing and providing private launching, reentry, and associated services that would complement the launching, reentry, and associated capabilities of the United States Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the development of commercial launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services would enable the United States to retain its competitive position internationally, contributing to the national interest and economic well-being of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) providing launch services and reentry services by the private sector is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and would be facilitated by stable, minimal, and appropriate regulatory guidelines that are fairly and expeditiously applied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the United States should encourage private sector launches, reentries, and associated services and, only to the extent necessary, regulate those launches, reentries, and services to ensure compliance with international obligations of the United States and to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) space transportation, including the establishment and operation of launch sites, reentry sites, and complementary facilities, the providing of launch services and reentry services, the establishment of support facilities, and the providing of support services, is an important element of the transportation system of the United States, and in connection with the commerce of the United States there is a need to develop a strong space transportation infrastructure with significant private sector involvement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the participation of State governments in encouraging and facilitating private sector involvement in space-related activity, particularly through the establishment of a space transportation-related infrastructure, including launch sites, reentry sites, complementary facilities, and launch site and reentry site support facilities, is in the national interest and is of significant public benefit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the goal of safely opening space to the American people and their private commercial, scientific, and cultural enterprises should guide Federal space investments, policies, and regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) private industry has begun to develop commercial launch vehicles capable of carrying human beings into space and greater private investment in these efforts will stimulate the Nation's commercial space transportation industry as a whole;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) space transportation is inherently risky, and the future of the commercial human space flight industry will depend on its ability to continually improve its safety performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) a critical area of responsibility for the Department of Transportation is to regulate the operations and safety of the emerging commercial human space flight industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) the public interest is served by creating a clear legal, regulatory, and safety regime for commercial human space flight; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) the regulatory standards governing human space flight must evolve as the industry matures so that regulations neither stifle technology development nor expose crew or space flight participants to avoidable risks as the public comes to expect greater safety for crew and space flight participants from the industry.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to promote economic growth and entrepreneurial activity through use of the space environment for peaceful purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the United States private sector to provide launch vehicles, reentry vehicles, and associated services by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) simplifying and expediting the issuance and transfer of commercial licenses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) facilitating and encouraging the use of Government-developed space technology; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promoting the continuous improvement of the safety of launch vehicles designed to carry humans, including through the issuance of regulations, to the extent permitted by this chapter;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide that the Secretary of Transportation is to oversee and coordinate the conduct of commercial launch and reentry operations, issue permits and commercial licenses and transfer commercial licenses authorizing those operations, and protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to facilitate the strengthening and expansion of the United States space transportation infrastructure, including the enhancement of United States launch sites and launch-site support facilities, and development of reentry sites, with Government, State, and private sector involvement, to support the full range of United States space-related activities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) contributed to an unplanned event or series of events during a licensed or per<!-- PDFPage:79 -->mitted commercial human space flight that posed a high risk of causing a serious or fatal injury (as defined in 49 CFR 830, as in effect on November 10, 2004) to crew or space flight participants; and</p>

Any such regulations shall take into consideration the evolving standards of safety in the commercial space flight industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to issue requirements or regulations to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, national security interests, and foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Procedures and Timetables</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall establish procedures and timetables that expedite review of a license or permit application and reduce the regulatory burden for an applicant.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) When a launch or reentry license is issued or transferred under this chapter, the licensee or transferee shall obtain liability insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts to compensate for the maximum probable loss from claims by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a third party for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under the license; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the United States Government against a person for damage or loss to Government property resulting from an activity carried out under the license.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the amounts required under paragraph (1)(A) and (B) of this subsection, after consulting with the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the heads of other appropriate executive agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the total claims related to one launch or reentry, a licensee or transferee is not required to obtain insurance or demonstrate financial responsibility of more than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) $500,000,000 under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $100,000,000 under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable cost if the amount is less than the applicable amount in clause (A)(i) or (ii) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An insurance policy or demonstration of financial responsibility under this subsection shall protect the following, to the extent of their potential liability for involvement in launch services or reentry services, at no cost to the Government:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) executive agencies and personnel, contractors, and subcontractors of the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contractors, subcontractors, and customers of the licensee or transferee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) contractors and subcontractors of the customer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Reciprocal Waiver of Claims</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A launch or reentry license issued or transferred under this chapter shall contain a provision requiring the licensee or transferee to make a reciprocal waiver of claims with its contractors, subcontractors, and customers, and contractors and subcontractors of the customers, involved in launch services or reentry services under which each party to the waiver agrees to be responsible for property damage or loss it sustains, or for personal injury to, death of, or property damage or loss sustained by its own employees resulting from an activity carried out under the applicable license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Transportation shall make, for the Government, executive agencies of the Government involved in launch services or reentry services, and contractors and subcontractors involved in launch services or reentry services, a reciprocal waiver of claims with the licensee or transferee, contractors, subcontractors, crew, space flight participants, and customers of the licensee or transferee, and contractors and subcontractors of the customers, involved in launch services or reentry services under which each party to the waiver agrees to be responsible for property damage or loss it <!-- PDFPage:85 -->sustains, or for personal injury to, death of, or property damage or loss sustained by its own employees or by space flight participants, resulting from an activity carried out under the applicable license. The waiver applies only to the extent that claims are more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section. After consulting with the Administrator and the Secretary of the Air Force, the Secretary of Transportation may waive, for the Government and a department, agency, and instrumentality of the Government, the right to recover damages for damage or loss to Government property to the extent insurance is not available because of a policy exclusion the Secretary of Transportation decides is usual for the type of insurance involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Determination of Maximum Probable Losses</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall determine the maximum probable losses under subsection (a)(1)(A) and (B) of this section associated with an activity under a license not later than 90 days after a licensee or transferee requires a determination and submits all information the Secretary requires. The Secretary shall amend the determination as warranted by new information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Not later than November 15 of each year, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives a report on current determinations made under subsection (c) of this section related to all issued licenses and the reasons for the determinations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than May 15 of each year, the Secretary of Transportation shall review the amounts specified in subsection (a)(3)(A) of this section and submit a report to Congress that contains proposed adjustments in the amounts to conform with changed liability expectations and availability of insurance on the world market. The proposed adjustment takes effect 30 days after a report is submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Launches or Reentries Involving Government Facilities and Personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Transportation shall establish requirements consistent with this chapter for proof of financial responsibility and other assurances necessary to protect the Government and its executive agencies and personnel from liability, death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss as a result of a launch or operation of a launch site or reentry site or a reentry involving a facility or personnel of the Government. The Secretary may not relieve the Government of liability under this subsection for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from the willful misconduct of the Government or its agents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Collection and Crediting Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Government shall collect a payment owed for damage or loss to Government property under its jurisdiction or control resulting from an activity carried out under a launch or reentry license issued or transferred under this chapter. The payment shall be credited to the current applicable appropriation, fund, or account of the department, agency, or instrumentality.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;50915. Paying claims exceeding liability insurance and financial responsibility requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) To the extent provided in advance in an appropriation law or to the extent additional legislative authority is enacted providing for paying claims in a compensation plan submitted under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary of Transportation shall provide for the payment by the United States Government of a successful claim (including reasonable litigation or settlement expenses) of a third party against a licensee or transferee under this chapter, a contractor, subcontractor, or customer of the licensee or transferee, or a contractor or subcontractor of a customer, but not against a space flight participant, resulting from an activity carried out under the license issued or transferred under this chapter for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss resulting from an activity carried out under the license. However, claims may be paid under this section only to the extent the total amount of successful claims related to one launch or reentry&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is more than the amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not more than $1,500,000,000 (plus additional amounts necessary to reflect inflation occurring after January 1, 1989) above that insurance or financial responsibility amount.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not provide for paying a part of a claim for which death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss results from willful misconduct by the licensee or transferee. To the extent insurance required under section 50914(a)(1)(A) of this title is not available to cover a successful third party liability claim because of an insurance policy exclusion the Secretary decides is usual for the type of insurance involved, the Secretary may provide for paying the excluded claims without regard to the limitation contained in section 50914(a)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Notice, Participation, and Approval</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before a payment under subsection (a) of this section is made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) notice must be given to the Government of a claim, or a civil action related to the claim, against a party described in subsection (a)(1) of this section for death, bodily injury, or property damage or loss;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Government must be given an opportunity to participate or assist in the defense of the claim or action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary must approve any part of a settlement to be paid out of appropriations of the Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Withholding Payments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may withhold a payment under subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary certifies that the amount is not reasonable. However, the Secretary shall deem to be reasonable the amount of a claim finally decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Surveys, Reports, and Compensation Plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) If as a result of an activity carried out under a license issued or transferred under this chapter the total of claims related to one launch or reentry is likely to be more than the amount of required insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) survey the causes and extent of damage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) submit expeditiously to Congress a report on the results of the survey.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after a court determination indicates that the liability for the total of claims related to one launch or reentry may be more than the required amount of insurance or demonstration of financial responsibility, the President, on the recommendation of the Secretary, shall submit to Congress a compensation plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) outlines the total dollar value of the claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recommends sources of amounts to pay for the claims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) includes legislative language required to carry out the plan if additional legislative authority is required; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) for a single event or incident, may not be for more than $1,500,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A compensation plan submitted to Congress under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) have an identification number; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be submitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives on the same day and when the Senate and House are in session.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:87 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Congressional Resolutions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In this subsection, &ldquo;resolution&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) means a joint resolution of Congress the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &ldquo;That the Congress approves the compensation plan numbered &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; submitted to the Congress on &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; XX, 20&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;.&rdquo;, with the blank spaces being filled appropriately; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not include a resolution that includes more than one compensation plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Senate shall consider under this subsection a compensation plan requiring additional appropriations or legislative authority not later than 60 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after the date on which the plan is submitted to Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A resolution introduced in the Senate shall be referred immediately to a committee by the President of the Senate. All resolutions related to the same plan shall be referred to the same committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If the committee of the Senate to which a resolution has been referred does not report the resolution within 20 calendar days after it is referred, a motion is in order to discharge the committee from further consideration of the resolution or to discharge the committee from further consideration of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A motion to discharge may be made only by an individual favoring the resolution and is highly privileged (except that the motion may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution on the plan). Debate on the motion is limited to one hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed and another motion to discharge the committee from another resolution on the same plan may not be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) After a committee of the Senate reports, or is discharged from further consideration of, a resolution, a motion to proceed to the consideration of the resolution is in order at any time, even though a similar previous motion has been disagreed to. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Debate on the resolution referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph is limited to not more than 10 hours, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The following shall be decided in the Senate without debate:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a motion to postpone related to the discharge from committee.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 102&ndash;555, &sect;2, Oct. 28, 1992, 106 Stat. 4163, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The continuous collection and utilization of land remote sensing data from space are of major benefit in studying and understanding human impacts on the global environment, in managing the Earth's natural resources, in carrying out national security functions, and in planning and conducting many other activities of scientific, economic, and social importance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Federal Government's Landsat system established the United States as the world leader in land remote sensing technology.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The national interest of the United States lies in maintaining international leadership in satellite land remote sensing and in broadly promoting the beneficial use of remote sensing data.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The cost of Landsat data has impeded the use of such data for scientific purposes, such as for global environmental change research, as well as for other public sector applications.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Given the importance of the Landsat program to the United States, urgent actions, including expedited procurement procedures, are required to ensure data continuity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Full commercialization of the Landsat program cannot be achieved within the foreseeable future, and thus should not serve as the near-term goal of national policy on land remote sensing; however, commercialization of land remote sensing should remain a long-term goal of United States policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Despite the success and importance of the Landsat system, funding and organizational uncertainties over the past several years have placed its future in doubt and have jeopardized United States leadership in land remote sensing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Recognizing the importance of the Landsat program in helping to meet national and commercial objectives, the President approved, on February 11, 1992, a National Space Policy Directive which was developed by the National Space Council and commits the United States to ensuring the continuity of Landsat coverage into the 21st century.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Because Landsat data are particularly important for national security purposes and global environmental change research, management responsibilities for the program should be transferred from the Department of Commerce to an integrated program management involving the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Regardless of management responsibilities for the Landsat program, the Nation's broad civilian, national security, commercial, and foreign policy interests in remote sensing will best be served by ensuring that Landsat remains an unclassified program that operates according to the principles of open skies and nondiscriminatory access.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Technological advances aimed at reducing the size and weight of satellite systems hold the potential for dramatic reductions in the cost, and substantial improvements in the capabilities, of future land remote sensing systems, but such technological advances have not been demonstrated for land remote sensing and therefore cannot be relied upon as the sole means of achieving data continuity for the Landsat program.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) A technology demonstration program involving advanced remote sensing technologies could serve a vital role in determining the design of a follow-on spacecraft to Landsat 7, while also helping to determine whether such a spacecraft should be funded by the United States Government, by the private sector, or by an international consortium.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) To maximize the value of the Landsat program to the American public, unenhanced Landsat 4 through 6 data should be made available, at a minimum, to United States Government agencies, to global environmental change researchers, and to other researchers who are financially supported by the United States Government, at the cost of fulfilling user requests, and unenhanced Landsat 7 data should be made available to all users at the cost of fulfilling user requests.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) To stimulate development of the commercial market for unenhanced data and value-added services, the United States Government should adopt a data policy for Landsat 7 which allows competition within the private sector for distribution of unenhanced data and value-added services.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and pose a similar threat in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects&rsquo; closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this section the term &lsquo;near-Earth object&rsquo; means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Survey program</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 2005].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) [Amended former section 2451 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.]</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Fifth-year report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after the date of enactment of this Act, a report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since the date of enactment of this Act.</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended option.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;422, title VIII, &sect;802, Oct. 15, 2008, 122 Stat. 4803, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects&rsquo; closest approach to Earth and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Asteroid and comet collisions rank as one of the most costly natural disasters that can occur.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The time needed to eliminate or mitigate the threat of a collision of a potentially hazardous near-Earth object with Earth is measured in decades.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Unlike earthquakes and hurricanes, asteroids and comets can provide adequate collision information, enabling the United States to include both asteroid-collision and comet-collision disaster recovery and disaster avoidance in its public-safety structure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Basic information is needed for technical and policy decisionmaking for the United States to create a comprehensive program in order to be ready to eliminate and mitigate the serious and credible threats to humankind posed by potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) As a first step to eliminate and to mitigate the risk of such collisions, situation and decision analysis processes, as well as procedures and system resources, must be in place well before a collision threat becomes known.&rdquo;</p>
