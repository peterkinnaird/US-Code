<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General purposes; findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of sections 71 to 71i, 72, 73, and 74 of this title to secure comprehensive planning for the physical development of the National Capital and its environs; to provide for the participation of the appropriate planning agencies of the environs in such planning; and to establish the agency and procedures requisite to the administration of the functions of the Federal and District of Columbia governments related to such planning. The Congress finds that the location of the seat of government in the District of Columbia has brought about the development of a metropolitan region extending well into adjoining territory in Maryland and Virginia; that effective comprehensive planning is necessary on a regional basis and of continuing importance to the Federal establishment; that the distribution of Federal installations throughout the region has been and will continue to be a major influence in determining the extent and character of development; that there is needed a central planning agency for the National Capital region to coordinate certain developmental activities of the many different agencies of the Federal and District Governments so that such activities may conform with general objectives; that there is an increasing mutuality of interest and responsibility between the various levels of government that calls for coordinate and unified policies in planning both Federal and local development in the interest of order and economy; that there are developmental problems of an interstate character, the planning of which requires collaboration between Federal, State, and local governments in the interest of equity and constructive action; and that the instrumentalities and procedures herein provided will aid in providing the Congress from time to time with information and advice requisite to legislation. The general objective of said sections is to enable appropriate agencies to plan for the development of the Federal establishment at the seat of government in a manner consistent with the nature and function of the National Capital and with due regard for the rights and prerogatives of the adjoining States and local governments to exercise control appropriate to their functions, and in a manner which will, in accordance with present and future needs, best promote public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity, and the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in sections 71 to 71i, 72, 73, and 74 of this title, (1) &ldquo;region&rdquo; or &ldquo;National Capital region&rdquo; means the District of Columbia; Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties in Maryland; Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William Counties in Virginia; and all cities now or hereafter existing in Maryland or Virginia within the geographic area bounded by the outer boundaries of the combined area of said counties; (2) &ldquo;environs&rdquo; means the territory surrounding the District of Columbia included within the National Capital region; (3) &ldquo;National Capital&rdquo; means the District of Columbia and territory owned by the United States within the environs; and (4) &ldquo;planning agency&rdquo; means any city, county, bi-county, part-county, or regional planning agency authorized under State and local laws to make and adopt comprehensive plans whether or not its jurisdiction is exclusive or concurrent.</p>

The Mayor shall be responsible for coordinating the planning activities of the District government and for preparing and implementing the District elements of the comprehensive plan for the National Capital, which may include land use elements, urban renewal and redevelopment elements, a multiyear program of public works for the District, and physical, social, economic, transportation, and population elements. The Mayor's planning responsibility shall not extend to Federal or international projects and developments in the District, as determined by the Commission, or to the United States Capitol buildings and grounds as defined in sections 193a and 193m of this title, or to any extension thereof or additions thereto, or to buildings and grounds under the care of the Architect of the Capitol. In carrying out his responsibility under this section, the Mayor shall establish procedures for citizen participation in the planning process, and for appropriate meaningful consultation with any State or local government or planning agency in the National Capital region affected by any aspect of a comprehensive plan (including amendments thereto) affecting or relating to the District.</p>

If the Commission finds such negative impact it shall certify its findings (in sufficient detail that the Council can understand the basis of the objection of the Commission) and recommendations to the Council, and such element or amendment shall not be implemented. If the Commission takes no action with respect to such modified element or amendment within such sixty days, such modified element or amendment shall be deemed to have no such negative impact and shall be incorporated into the comprehensive plan and it shall be implemented. Any element or amendment which the Commission has determined to have a negative impact on the Federal Establishment in the National Capital, and which is submitted again in a modified form not less than one year from the day it was last rejected by the Commission shall be deemed to be a new element or amendment for purposes of the review procedure specified in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Commission and the Mayor shall jointly publish, from time to time as appropriate, a comprehensive plan for the National Capital, consisting of the elements of the comprehensive plan for the Federal activities in the National Capital developed by the Commission, and the District elements developed by the Mayor and the Council in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Section 1. Abolition</h4>
<p class="note-body">The National Capital Regional Planning Council (66 Stat. 783), together with all of its functions, is hereby abolished.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 2. Liquidation</h4>
<p class="note-body">The National Capital Planning Commission shall make such provisions as it shall deem necessary respecting the winding up of the outstanding affairs of the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">The time has come to recognize the readiness of local governments in the Washington area to undertake a role which is properly and rightfully theirs. To that end, I am submitting a reorganization plan to abolish the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">Comprehensive regional planning is vital to the orderly development of our metropolitan areas. Nowhere is it more important than in the National Capital region.</p>
<p class="note-body">To be most effective, regional planning must be a responsibility of the area's State and local governments acting together to solve mutual problems of growth and change. It should not be a Federal function, although the Federal Government should support and advance it.</p>
<p class="note-body">The need for cooperative planning was recognized years ago in the National Capital region. The establishment of the National Capital Regional Planning Council in 1952 to prepare a comprehensive development plan was a major step in meeting that need.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, the Council was designed for conditions which no longer exist. It was established by Federal law as a Federal agency financed by Federal funds because the various local jurisdictions then felt they were not in a position to provide the financing necessary for areawide comprehensive planning.</p>
<p class="note-body">The situation that existed in 1952 has been changed by two major developments&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The founding of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">The inauguration of a nationwide urban planning assistance program, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;701 Program.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, established in 1957, is a voluntary association of elected officials of local governments in the area. It has a competent professional staff and has done constructive work on areawide development matters. It had a budget of nearly a quarter of a million dollars for fiscal year 1965, mostly derived from local government contributions, and has developed to the point where it can fully carry out the State and local aspects of regional planning.</p>
<p class="note-body">The urban planning assistance program provides for Federal financing of two-thirds of the cost of metropolitan planning. The National Capital Regional Planning Council, as a Federal agency, is not eligible for assistance under this program. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, however, became eligible for that assistance under the terms of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. Accordingly, the elected local governments of the National Capital region have declared their intention of undertaking the responsibility for areawide comprehensive planning through the Council of Governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan will not alter the basic responsibilities of the National Capital Planning Commission. That Commission will continue to represent the Federal interest in the planning and development of the region. Indeed, its work should increase as comprehensive regional planning by the Council of Governments is accelerated. In accord with the reorganization plan, the Commission will work closely with the Council of Governments in regional planning. The Commission will also deal directly with the suburban jurisdictions and assume the liaison functions now exercised by the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan will improve existing organizational arrangements of and promote more effective and efficient planning for the National Capital region.</p>
<p class="note-body">It will also result in long-range savings to the Federal Government. The regional planning effort of the Council of Governments is supported in part by local contributions. The same work done by the National Capital Regional Planning Council has been supported totally with Federal funds. The plan will eliminate this overlapping effort.</p>
<p class="note-body">Annual savings of at least $25,000 should result from the reorganization plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">The functions to be abolished by the reorganization plan are provided for in sections 2(e), 3, 4, 5(d), and 6(b) <!-- PDFPage:22 -->of the act approved June 6, 1924, entitled &ldquo;An Act providing for a comprehensive development of the park and playground system of the National Capital&rdquo; (43 Stat. 463), as amended (66 Stat. 783, 40 U.S.C. 71a(e), 71b, 71c, 71d(d), and 71E(b)).</p>
<p class="note-body">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the final adoption of the comprehensive plan or any element thereof, or any subsequent revision, the Commission shall present such plan, element, or revision to the appropriate Federal or District of Columbia authorities for comment and recommendations. Presentation of proposed revisions may at the Commission's discretion be made annually in a consolidated form.

The Commission may, in addition and at its discretion, periodically provide opportunity by public hearings, meetings, or conferences, exhibitions and publication of its plans, for review and comments by nongovernmental agencies or groups, and, in consultation with the Council of the District of Columbia, encourage the formation of one or more citizen advisory councils.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out its planning functions with respect to Federal developments or projects in the environs, the Commission may act in conjunction and cooperation and enter into agreements with any State or local authority or planning agency, as the Commission may deem necessary, to effectuate the adoption of any plan or proposal and secure its realization.</p>

<p class="note-body">The Act of Congress approved August 30, 1890, providing a site for the Government Printing Office (United States Statutes at Large, volume 26, chapter 837), referred to in text, is act Aug. 30, 1890, ch. 837, 26 Stat. 412, which enacted section 120 of this title, section 861a of former Title 10, Army and Air Force, section 446 of Title 16, Conservation, sections 497, 601 and 651 of former Title 31, Money and Finance, section 887 of Title 33, Navigation and Navigable Waters, and sections 212, 662 and 945 of Title 43, Public Lands, and amended section 321 of Title 43. Former Titles 10 and 31 were revised generally by act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;1, 70A Stat. 1, and Pub. L. 97&ndash;258, Sept. 13, 1982, 96 Stat. 877, respectively. For disposition of sections of former titles, see Table I&mdash;Revised Titles. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 2 of act August 30, 1890, referred to in text, created a board consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Public Printer, and the Architect of the Capitol to acquire land for the accommodation of the Government Printing Office and the construction of needed storage and distributing warehouses in connection therewith. Section 3 of such act authorized the board to acquire the land by negotiation at a price not <!-- PDFPage:27 -->above a fair relative value as to other lands which had been sold in the immediate vicinity; or if the board were unable to purchase said land by agreement with any one or more of the respective owners at a reasonable price within sixty days after the passage of the act, it was authorized to &ldquo;make application to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia [now the United States District Court for the District of Columbia], at any general or special term thereof, by petition for the condemnation of such land not so purchased, and for the ascertainment of its value. Such petition shall contain a particular description of the property not so purchased, and selected for the purpose aforesaid, with the name of the owner or owners thereof and their residences, so far as the same may be ascertained, together with a plan of the land proposed to be taken; and thereupon the said court is authorized and required to cite all such owners and all other persons interested to appear in said court at a time to be fixed by such court, on reasonable notice, to answer the said petition; and if it shall appear to the court that there are any owners or other persons interested who are under disability the court shall give public notice of the time at which the said court will proceed with the matter of condemnation; and at such time if it shall appear that there are any persons under disability either who have appeared or who have not appeared, the court shall appoint guardians ad litem for each such persons, and the court shall thereupon proceed to appoint three capable and disinterested commissioners to appraise the value of the respective interests of all persons concerned in such lands, under such regulations as to notice and hearing as to the court shall seem meet. Such commissioners shall thereupon, after being duly sworn for the proper performance of their duties, examine the premises and hear the persons in interest who may appear before them, and return their appraisement of the value of the interests of all persons, respectively, in such land; and in case any of the persons entitled according to the judgment of the court are under disability, or can not be found, or neglect to receive payment, the money to be paid to any of them shall be deposited in the Treasury to their credit, unless there shall be some person lawfully authorized to receive the same under the direction of the court, and when such payments are so made, or the amounts belonging to persons to whom payment shall not be made are so deposited, the said lands shall be deemed to be condemned and taken by the United States for the public use.&rdquo; These provisions were never executed and the appropriation therefor was suspended by act Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 542, 26 Stat. 989.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, the provisions of section 3 of the act of Aug. 30, 1890, referred to and partly quoted above, with respect to condemnation proceeding, were rendered general and permanent by a provision of the end of that section which read as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;And hereafter, in all cases of the taking of property in the District of Columbia for public use, whether herein, heretofore, or hereafter authorized, the foregoing provisions, as it respects the application by the proper officer to the supreme court of the District of Columbia [see above for change in name] and the proceedings therein shall be as in the foregoing provisions declared&rdquo;. In view of this provision, section 3, reworded at the beginning thereof to incorporate it, was classified to former section 120 of this title. Former section 120 was superseded in effect by act Mar. 1, 1929, ch. 416, 45 Stat. 1415, which was formerly classified to section 361 et seq. of this title.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Type of bonds required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before any contract for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the United States is awarded to any person, such person shall furnish to the United States the following bonds, which shall become binding upon the award of the contract to such person, who is hereinafter designated as &ldquo;contractor&rdquo;:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A performance bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the officer awarding such contract, and in such amount as he shall deem adequate, for the protection of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A payment bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to such officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract for the use of each such person. Whenever the total amount payable by the terms of the contract shall be not more than $1,000,000 the said payment bond shall be in a sum of one-half the total amount payable by the terms of the contract. Whenever the total amount payable by the terms of the contract shall be more than $1,000,000 and not more than $5,000,000, the said payment bond shall be in a sum of 40 per centum of the total amount payable by the terms of the contract. Whenever the total amount payable by the terms of the contract shall be more than $5,000,000 the said payment bond shall be in the sum of $2,500,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Waiver of bonds for contracts performed in foreign countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The contracting officer in respect of any contract is authorized to waive the requirement of a performance bond and payment bond for so much of the work under such contract as is to be performed in a foreign country if he finds that it is impracticable for the contractor to furnish such bonds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority to require additional bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of any contracting officer to require a performance bond or other security in addition to those, or in cases other than the cases specified in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coverage for taxes in performance bond</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every performance bond required under this section shall specifically provide coverage for taxes imposed by the United States which are collected, deducted, or withheld from wages paid by the contractor in carrying out the contract with respect to which such bond is furnished. However, the United States shall give the surety or sureties on such bond written notice, with respect to any such unpaid taxes attributable to any period, within ninety days after the date when such contractor files a return for such period, except that no such notice shall be given more than one hundred and eighty days from the date when a return for the period was required to be filed under title 26. No suit on such bond for such taxes shall be commenced by the United States unless notice is given as provided in the preceding sentence, and no such suit shall be commenced after the expiration of one year after the day on which such notice is given.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a State or political subdivision or agency thereof or any person makes application for the grant of an easement in, over, or upon real property of the United States for a right-of-way or other purpose, the executive agency having control of such real property may grant to the applicant, on behalf of the United States, such easement as the head of such agency determines will not be adverse to the interests of the United States, subject to such reservations, exceptions, limitations, benefits, burdens, terms, or conditions, including those provided in section 319a of this title, as the head of the agency deems necessary to protect the interests of the United States. Such grant may be made without consideration, or with monetary or other consideration, including any interest in real property. In connection with the grant of such an easement, the executive agency concerned may relinquish to the State in which the affected real property is located such legislative jurisdiction as the executive agency deems necessary or desirable. Relinquishment of legislative jurisdiction under the authority of sections 319 to 319c of this title may be accomplished by filing with the Governor of the State concerned a notice of relinquishment to take effect upon acceptance thereof or by proceeding in such manner as the laws applicable to such State may provide.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reports of inspectors; determination of amount of unpaid wages and liquidated damages; authorization for direct payments by Comptroller General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer or person designated as inspector of the work to be performed under any contract of the character specified in section 329 of this title, or to aid in the enforcement or fulfillment thereof shall, upon observation or investigation, forthwith report to the proper officer of the United States, of any territory or possession, or of the District of Columbia, all violations of the provisions of this subchapter occurring in the performance of such work, together with the name of each laborer or mechanic who was required or permitted to work in violation of such provisions and the day or days of such violation. The amount of unpaid wages and liquidated damages owing under the provisions of this subchapter shall be administratively determined and the officer or person whose duty it is to approve the payment of moneys by the United States, the territory, or the District of Columbia in connection with the performance of the contract work shall direct the amount of such liquidated damages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the United States, said territory, or said District, and shall direct the amount of such unpaid wages to be withheld for the use and benefit of the laborers and mechanics who were not compensated as required under the provisions of this subchapter. The Comptroller General of the United States is authorized and directed to pay directly to such laborers and mechanics, from the sums withheld on account of underpayments of wages, the respective amounts administratively determined to be due, if the funds withheld are adequate, and, if not, an equitable proportion of such amounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rights of action and intervention against contractors and sureties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contracts, as aforesaid, are insufficient to reimburse all the laborers and mechanics with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the wages required pursuant to this subchapter, such laborers and mechanics shall, in the case of a department or agency of the Federal Government, have the rights of action and/or of intervention against the contractor and his sureties conferred by law upon persons furnishing labor or materials, and in such proceedings it shall be no defense that such laborers and mechanics accepted or agreed to accept less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily made refunds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Right of contractors to appeal; limitations; administrative determination; review by Secretary and issuance of final decision; filing claim in United States Court of Federal Claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contractor or subcontractor aggrieved by the withholding of a sum as liquidated damages as provided in this subchapter shall have the right, within sixty days thereafter, to appeal to the head of the agency of the United States or of the territory for which the contract work is done or by which financial assistance for the work is provided, or to the Mayor of the District of Columbia in the case of liquidated damages withheld for the use and benefit of said District. Such agency head or Mayor, as the case may be, shall have authority to review the administrative determination of liquidated damages and to issue a final order affirming such determination; or, if it is found that the sum determined is incorrect or that the contractor or subcontractor violated the provisions of this subchapter inadvertently notwithstanding the exercise of due care on his part and that of his agents, recommendations may be made to the Secretary that an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages be made, or that the contractor or subcontractor be relieved of liability for such liquidated damages. The Secretary shall review all pertinent facts in the matter and may conduct such investigations as he deems necessary, so as to affirm or reject the recommendation. The decision of the Secretary shall be final. In all such cases in which a contractor or subcontractor may be aggrieved by a final order for the withholding of liquidated damages as hereinbefore provided, such contractor or subcontractor may, within sixty days after such final order, file a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims: <em>Provided, however</em>, That final orders of the agency head, the Mayor of the District of Columbia or the Secretary, as the case may be, shall be conclusive with respect to findings of fact if such findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Condition of contracts; proceedings for promulgation of regulations; hearing, consultation with Advisory Committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be a condition of each contract (other than a contract referred to in section 329(c) of this title) which is entered into under legislation subject to Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1267), and is for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and decorating, that no contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work shall require any laborer or mechanic employed in the performance of the contract to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to his health or safety, as determined under construction safety and health standards promulgated by the Secretary by regulation based on proceedings pursuant to section 553 of title 5, provided that such proceedings include a hearing of the nature authorized by said section. In formulating such standards, the Secretary shall consult with the Advisory Committee created by subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with section and regulations: inspections, hearings, orders, findings of fact, and decisions; application of sections 38 and 39 of title 41; opportunity for hearing; consequences of noncompliance: cancellation of contracts, completion contracts, additional costs, and withholding of assistance; nonapplication of section 330 of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to make such inspections, hold such hearings, issue such orders, and make such decisions based on finding of fact, as are deemed necessary to gain compliance with this section and any health and safety standard promulgated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section, and for such purposes the Secretary and the United States district courts shall have the authority and jurisdiction provided by sections 38 and 39 of title 41. In the event that the Secretary of Labor determines noncompliance under the provisions of this section after an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing by the Secretary of any condition of a contract of a type described in clause (1) or (2) of section 329(a) of this title, the governmental agency for which the contract work is done shall have the right to cancel the contract, and to enter into other contracts for the completion of the contract work, charging any additional cost to the original contractor. In the event of noncompliance, as determined by the Secretary after an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing by the Secretary, of any condition of a contract of a type described in clause (3) of section 329(a) of this title, the governmental agency by which financial guarantee, assistance, or insurance for the contract work is provided shall have the right to withhold any such assistance attributable to the performance of the contract. Section 330 of this title shall not apply to the enforcement of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction; cause shown; enforcement of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction for cause shown, in any actions brought by the Secretary, to enforce compliance with the construction safety and health standard promulgated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Finding of ineffective protection against violations; transmission of names of violators to Comptroller General; contract awards prohibition; termination of restriction and notification of Comptroller General and Government agencies; judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary determines on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing that, by repeated willful or grossly negligent violations of this subchapter, a contractor or sub<!-- PDFPage:146 -->contractor has demonstrated that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section are not effective to protect the safety and health of his employees, the Secretary shall make a finding to that effect and shall, not sooner than thirty days after giving notice of the findings to all interested persons, transmit the name of such contractor or subcontractor to the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Comptroller General shall distribute each name so transmitted to him to all agencies of the Government. Unless the Secretary otherwise recommends, no contract subject to this section shall be awarded to such contractor or subcontractor or to any person in which such contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest until three years have elapsed from the date the name is transmitted to the Comptroller General. If, before the end of such three-year period, the Secretary, after affording interested persons due notice and opportunity for hearing, is satisfied that a contractor or subcontractor whose name he has transmitted to the Comptroller General will thereafter comply responsibly with the requirements of this section, shall terminate the application of the preceding sentence to such contractor or subcontractor (and to any person in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest); and when the Comptroller General is informed of the Secretary's action he shall inform all agencies of the Government thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person aggrieved by the Secretary's action under subsections (b) or (d) of this section may, within sixty days after receiving notice thereof, file with the appropriate United States court of appeals a petition for review of such action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary, who shall thereupon file in the court the record upon which he based his action, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. The findings of fact by the Secretary, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be final. The court shall have power to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary or the appropriate Government agency. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health; establishment; membership; appointment; representation of interests; advice in formulation of standards, regulations, and policy matters; appointment of experts or consultants; compensation, travel expenses, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish in the Department of Labor an Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Advisory Committee&rdquo;) consisting of nine members appointed, without regard to the civil service laws, by the Secretary. The Secretary shall appoint one such member as Chairman. Three members of the Advisory Committee shall be persons representative of contractors to whom this section applies, three members shall be persons representative of employees primarily in the building trades and construction industry engaged in carrying out contracts to which this section applies, and three public representatives who shall be selected on the basis of their professional and technical competence and experience in the construction health and safety field.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Advisory Committee shall advise the Secretary in the formulation of construction safety and health standards and other regulations, and with respect to policy matters arising in the administration of this section. The Secretary may appoint such special advisory and technical experts or consultants as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Advisory Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Members of the Advisory Committee shall, while serving on the business of the Advisory Committee, be entitled to receive compensation at rates fixed by the Secretary, but not exceeding $100 per day, including traveltime; and while so serving away from their homes or regular places of business, they may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of title 5 for persons in the Government service employed intermittently.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Safety programs: promotion; prevention of injuries through reports, data, and consultations with employers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide for the establishment and supervision of programs for the education and training of employers and employees in the recognition, avoidance, and prevention of unsafe working conditions in employments covered by this subchapter, and to collect such reports and data and to consult with and advise employers as to the best means of preventing injuries.</p>

No such plan, and no major amendment thereof, shall be filed with the Administrator until sixty days after general notice of the proposed plan or amendment has been published and interested persons have been given at least thirty days during which to submit comments.

<p class="statutory-body">(D) Where the State agency is authorized to assess and collect service charges from participating recipients to cover direct and reasonable indirect costs of its activities, the method of establishing such charges shall be set out in the State plan of operation. Such charges shall be fair and equitable and shall be based on services performed by the State agency, including, but not limited to, screening, packing, crating, removal, and transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The State plan of operation shall provide that the State agency may impose reasonable terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions on the use of property to be donated under paragraph (3) of this subsection and shall impose such terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions in the case of any passenger motor vehicle and any item of other property having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) otherwise pursuant to the provisions of this Act under such terms and conditions and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Administrator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding sections 485 and 512(c) of this title, the Administrator, from the proceeds of sale of any such property, may reimburse the State agency for such expenses relating to the care and handling of such property as he shall deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection, (A) the term &ldquo;public agency&rdquo; means any State, political subdivision thereof (including any unit of local government or economic development district), or any department, agency, instrumentality thereof (including instrumentalities created by compact or other agreement between States or political subdivisions), or any Indian tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community located on a State reservation and (B) the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;485. Proceeds from transfer, sale, etc., of property</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Disposition of receipts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All proceeds under this subchapter from any transfer of excess property to a Federal agency for its use, or from any sale, lease, or other disposition of surplus property, shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deposit of proceeds from sales; use; report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, all the proceeds of such dispositions of surplus real and related personal property made by the Administrator of General Services shall be set aside in a separate fund in the Treasury. Not more than an amount to be determined quarterly by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may be obligated from such fund by the Administrator to pay the direct expenses incurred for the utilization of excess property and the disposal of surplus property under this Act for fees of appraisers, auctioneers, and realty brokers, for costs of environmental and historic preservation services, and for advertising and surveying. Such payments from this fund may be used either to pay such expenses directly or to reimburse the fund or appropriation initially bearing such expenses. Fees paid to appraisers, auctioneers, and brokers shall be in accordance with the scale of fees customarily paid for such services in similar commercial transactions, and in no event shall more than 12 per centum of the proceeds of all dispositions within each fiscal year of surplus real and related personal property be paid out of such proceeds under this authorization to meet <!-- PDFPage:185 -->direct expenses incurred in connection with such dispositions. Periodically, but not less often than once each year, any excess funds beyond current operating needs shall be transferred from the fund to miscellaneous receipts: <em>Provided</em>, That a report of receipts, disbursements, and transfers to miscellaneous receipts under this authorization shall be made annually in connection with the budget estimates to the Director of Office of Management and Budget and to the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Credit to reimbursable fund or appropriation on certain transactions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where the property transferred or disposed of was acquired by the use of funds either not appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury or appropriated therefrom but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue or receipts, then the net proceeds of the disposition or transfer shall be credited to the reimbursable fund or appropriation or paid to the Federal agency which determined such property to be excess: <em>Provided</em>, That the proceeds shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts in any case when the agency which determined the property to be excess shall deem it uneconomical or impractical to ascertain the amount of net proceeds. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;net proceeds of the disposition or transfer&rdquo; means the proceeds of the disposition or transfer minus all expenses incurred for care and handling and disposition or transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special account deposits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any Federal agency disposing of surplus property under this subchapter (1) may deposit, in a special account with the Treasurer of the United States, such amount of the proceeds of such dispositions as it deems necessary to permit appropriate refunds to purchasers when any disposition is rescinded or does not become final, or payments for breach of any warranty, and (2) may withdraw therefrom amounts so to be refunded or paid, without regard to the origin of the funds withdrawn.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sale proceeds offset against price or cost of contractor's work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where any contract entered into by an executive agency or any subcontract under such contract authorizes the proceeds of any sale of property in the custody of the contractor or subcontractor to be credited to the price or cost of the work covered by such contract or subcontract, the proceeds of any such sale shall be credited in accordance with the contract or subcontract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Acceptance of property in lieu of cash</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any executive agency entitled to receive cash under any contract covering the lease, sale or other disposition of surplus property may in its discretion accept, in lieu of cash, any property determined by the President to be strategic or critical material at the prevailing market price thereof at the time the cash payment or payments became or become due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Management of credit, leases, and permits on property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where credit has been extended in connection with any disposition of surplus property under this subchapter or by War Assets Administration (or its predecessor agencies) under the Surplus Property Act of 1944, or where such disposition has been by lease or permit, the Administrator shall administer and manage such credit, lease, or permit, and any security therefor, and may enforce, adjust, and settle any right of the Government with respect thereto in such manner and upon such terms as he deems in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Property under control of a military department</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary of a military department determines that real property, and improvements thereon, under the control of that department (other than property at a military installation designated for closure or realignment) is excess to the needs of that department, the Secretary of Defense shall provide that the property be made available for transfer without reimbursement to the other military departments within the Department of Defense. If the property is not transferred to another military department, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall request the Administrator to transfer or dispose of such property in accordance with the provisions of this Act, section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(g)), or other applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall deposit any proceeds (less expenses of transferring or disposing of the property as provided in subsection (b) of this section) in a special account in the Treasury of the United States. The amount deposited in such account with respect to the transfer or disposal of any such property shall be available, to the extent provided in appropriation Acts, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 50 percent of such amount shall be available for facility maintenance and repair or environmental restoration at the military installation where the property is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 50 percent of such amount shall be available for facility maintenance and repair and for environmental restoration by the military department that had jurisdiction over the property before it was disposed of or transferred.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) As part of the annual request for authorizations of appropriations to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of Defense shall include an accounting of each transfer and disposal made in accordance with this subsection during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the request is made, including a detailed explanation of each such transfer and disposal and of the use of the proceeds received from it by the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;military installation&rdquo; shall have the meaning given that term in section 2687(e)(1) of title 10.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Recovery of costs incurred in sales of personal property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may retain from the proceeds of sales of personal property conducted by the General Services Administration amounts necessary to recover, to the extent practicable, costs incurred by the General Services Adminis<!-- PDFPage:186 -->tration (or its agent) in conducting such sales. The Administrator shall deposit amounts retained into the General Supply Fund established under section 756(a) of this title and may use such portion of amounts so deposited as is necessary to pay (1) direct costs incurred by the General Services Administration in conducting sales of personal property, and (2) indirect costs incurred by the General Services Administration that are reasonably related to those sales. Amounts retained that are not needed to pay the direct and indirect costs incurred shall periodically, but not less than annually, be transferred from the General Supply Fund to the general fund or another appropriate account in the Treasury.</p>

The Director shall determine the records, facilities, personnel, and appropriations to be transferred.</p>

<p class="note-body">(f) When a pool or system is discontinued or curtailed, such transfers of vehicles and related equipment and supplies, personnel, records, facilities, and funds as may be appropriate will be made, subject to the approval of the Director.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Ensure that the amount of office space used by each employee of the agency, or others using agency-controlled space, is held to the minimum necessary to accomplish the task that must be performed;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Manage the furniture, equipment, decoration, drapes, carpeting, plants and other accoutrements so that the use of all furnishings by the agency reflects a judicious employment of public moneys;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Consider, in making decisions concerning the use, acquisition, or disposal of work space and related furnishings, the effects of its actions on costs incurred by other Federal agencies;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Report all vacant work space retained for future Federal uses to the Administrator of General Services so that it may be made available for the temporary use of other Federal agencies, to the extent consistent with national defense requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Establish a work space management plan to meet the provisions of this Order, including specification of the goals to be achieved and actions to be taken by the agency in order to improve its utilization of all work space and related furnishings; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls and conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator of General Services, so that a government-wide reporting system may be developed.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. The Administrator of General Services is delegated authority, to the extent not prohibited by other laws, to conduct surveys, establish agency-wide objectives for work space use for each Executive agency, and establish procedures, guidelines and regulations to be followed by the agencies in developing the work space planning, information and reporting systems required by this Order.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 486(a) of title 40 of the United States Code, and in order to ensure that Federal real property resources are treated in accordance with their value as national assets and in the best interests of the Nation's taxpayers, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>General Requirements</em>. To ensure the effective and economical use of America's real property and public land assets, establish a focal point for the enunciation of clear and consistent Federal policies regarding the acquisition, management, and disposal of properties, and assure management accountability for implementing Federal real property management reforms, all Executive departments and agencies shall take immediate action to recognize the importance of such resources through increased management attention, establishment of clear goals and objectives, improved policies and levels of accountability, and other appropriate actions. Specifically:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Domestic Policy Council shall serve as the forum for approving government-wide real property management policies;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) All Executive departments and agencies shall establish internal policies and systems of accountability that ensure effective use of real property in support of mission-related activities, consistent with Federal policies regarding the acquisition, management, and disposal of such assets. All such agencies shall periodically review their real property holdings and conduct surveys of such property in accordance with standards and procedures determined by the Administrator of General Services. All such agencies shall also develop annual real property management improvement plans that include clear and concise goals and objectives related to all aspects of real property management, and identify sales, work space management, productivity, and excess property targets;</p>

Savings achieved as a result of improved management shall be applied to reduce Federal spending and to support program delivery;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration shall, in consultation with the land managing agencies, develop legislative initiatives that seek to improve Federal real property management through the adoption of appropriate private sector management techniques; the elimination of duplication of effort among agencies; and the establishment of managerial accountability for implementing effective and efficient real property management practices; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The President's Council on Management Improvement, subject to the policy direction of the Domestic Policy Council, shall conduct such additional studies as are necessary to improve Federal real property management by appropriate agencies and groups.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Public Lands</em>. In order to ensure that Federally owned lands, other than the real property covered by Section 2 of this Order, are managed in the most effective and economic manner, the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior shall take such steps as are appropriate to improve their management of public lands and National Forest System lands and shall develop appropriate legislative proposals necessary to facilitate that result.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12933, Oct. 20, 1994, 59 F.R. 53559, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">When a service contract for the maintenance of a public building expires and a follow-on contract is awarded for the same service, the successor contractor typically hires the majority of the predecessor's employees. On occasion, however, a follow-on contractor will hire a new work force, and the predecessor's employees are displaced.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a buyer and participant in the marketplace, the Government is concerned about hardships to individuals that may result from the operation of our procurement system.</p>
<p class="note-body">Furthermore, the Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency benefit from the fact that a carryover work force will minimize disruption to the delivery of services during any period of transition and provide the Government the benefits of an experienced and trained work force rather than one that may not be familiar with the Government facility.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a), and in order to promote economy and efficiency, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Statement of Policy</em>. It is the policy of the Federal Government that solicitations and building service contracts for public buildings shall include a clause that requires the contractor under a contract that succeeds a contract for performance of similar services at the same public building to offer those employees (other than managerial or supervisory employees) under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal to employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. There shall be no employment openings under the contract until such right of first refusal has been provided. Nothing in this order shall be construed to permit a contractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or laws of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. (a) &ldquo;Public building&rdquo; means any Government-owned building, whether single or multi-tenant occupancy, its grounds, approaches, and appurtenances, which is generally suitable for office or storage space or both for the use of one or more Federal agencies or mixed ownership corporations, and shall include the following: (1) Federal office buildings; (2) customhouses; (3) courthouses; (4) border inspection facilities; (5) warehouses; (6) records centers; (7) appraiser stores; and (8) relocation facilities and similar Federal facilities; but shall not include any such buildings: (A) on the public domain (including that reserved for national forests and other purposes); (B) on properties of the United States in foreign countries; (C) on Native American and Native Eskimo properties held in trust by the United States; (D) on lands used in connection with Federal programs for agricultural, recreational, and conservation purposes, including research in connection therewith; (E) on or used in connection with river, harbor, flood control, reclamation, or power projects; or for chemical manufacturing or development projects; or for nuclear production, research, or development projects; (F) on or used in connection with housing and residential projects; (G) on properties of the United States Postal Service; (H) on military installations (including any fort, camp, post, naval training station, airfield, proving ground, military supply depot, military school, or any similar facility of the Department of Defense); (I) on installations of the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, except regular office buildings; and (J) on Department of Veterans Affairs installations used for hospital or domiciliary purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Building services contract&rdquo; means a contract for recurring services related to the maintenance of a public building, e.g., janitorial, window washing, food service, laundry, protective services, lawn and grounds care, and inspection, maintenance, and repair of fixed equipment such as elevators, air-conditioning, and heating systems.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Exclusions</em>. This order shall not apply to (a) contracts under the simplified acquisition threshold;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) contracts awarded pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 46&ndash;48a; and any future enacted law creating an employment preference for some group of workers under building services contracts;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services provided to the Government under contracts with sheltered workshops employing the severely handicapped as outlined in the Edgar Amendment, section 505 of the Treasury, Postal Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 1995, Public Law 103&ndash;329 [40 U.S.C. 490c];</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) agreements for vending facilities entered into under the preference provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) services where the contractor's employees perform work at the public building and at other locations under contracts not subject to this order (e.g., pest control or trash removal where the contractor's employees visit the site periodically and where the employees under the contract respond to service calls), provided that employees shall not be deployed in a manner that is designed to avoid the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Contract Clause</em>. The following contract clause shall be included in solicitations and contracts for maintenance of public buildings that succeed contracts for performance of similar work at the same public building:</p>

This Executive order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act [41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], and disputes regarding the requirement of the contract clause shall be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary of Labor in regulations issued under this Executive order. To the extent practicable, such regulations shall favor the resolution of disputes by efficient and informal alternative dispute resolution methods.

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12954. Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12954, Mar. 8, 1995, 60 F.R. 13023, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Efficient economic performance and productivity are directly related to the existence of cooperative working relationships between employers and employees. When Federal contractors become involved in prolonged labor disputes with their employees, the Federal Government's economy, efficiency, and cost of operations are adversely affected. In order to operate as effectively as possible, by receiving timely goods and quality services, the Federal Government must assist the entities with which it has contractual relations to develop stable relationships with their employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">An important aspect of a stable collective bargaining relationship is the balance between allowing businesses to operate during a strike and preserving worker rights. This balance is disrupted when permanent replacement employees are hired. It has been found that strikes involving permanent replacement workers are longer in duration than other strikes. In addition, the use of permanent replacements can change a limited dispute into a broader, more contentious struggle, thereby exacerbating the problems that initially led to the strike. By permanently replacing its workers, an employer loses the accumulated knowledge, experience, skill, and expertise of its incumbent employees. These circumstances then adversely affect the businesses and entities, such as the Federal Government, which rely on that employer to provide high quality and reliable goods or services.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies shall not contract with employers that permanently replace lawfully striking employees. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. (a) The Secretary of Labor (&ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may investigate an organizational unit of a Federal contractor to determine whether the unit has permanently replaced lawfully striking workers. Such investigation shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 2(a) of this order where such complaints allege lawfully striking employees have been permanently replaced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary may hold such hearings, public or private, as he or she deems advisable, to determine whether an entity covered under section 2(a) has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may make a finding that it is appropriate to terminate the contract for convenience. The Secretary shall transmit that finding to the head of any department or agency that contracts with the contractor.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of the contracting department or agency may object to the termination for convenience of a contract or contracts of a contractor determined to have permanently replaced legally striking employees. If the head of the agency so objects, he or she shall set forth the reasons for not terminating the contract or contracts in a response in writing to the Secretary. In such case, the termination for convenience shall not be issued. The head of the contracting agency or department shall report to the Secretary those contracts that have been terminated for convenience under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) When the Secretary determines that a contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, the Secretary may debar the contractor, thereby making the contractor ineligible to receive government contracts. The Secretary shall notify the Administrator of the General Services Administration of the debarment, and the Administrator shall include the contractor on the consolidated list of debarred contractors. Departments and agencies shall not solicit offers from, award contracts to, or consent to subcontracts with these contractors unless the head of the agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that there is a compelling reason for such action, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The scope of the debarment normally will be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary finds to have permanently replaced lawfully striking workers.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:194 --><p class="note-body">(c) The period of the debarment may not extend beyond the date when the labor dispute precipitating the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers has been resolved, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. The Secretary shall publish or cause to be published, in the Federal Register, the names of contractors that have, in the judgement of the Secretary, permanently replaced lawfully striking employees and have been the subject of debarment.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. The Secretary shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, may adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the Secretary's functions under this order.</p>

The Secretary may delegate any function or duty of the Secretary under this order to any officer in the Department of Labor or to any other officer in the executive branch of the Government, with the consent of the head of the department or agency in which that officer serves.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after consultation with the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall take whatever action is appropriate to implement the provisions of this order and of any related rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary issued pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. The meaning of the term &ldquo;organizational unit of a Federal contractor&rdquo; as used in this order shall be defined in regulations that shall be issued by the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with affected agencies. This order shall apply only to contracts in excess of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 12. (a) The provisions of section 3 of this order shall only apply to situations in which contractors have permanently replaced lawfully striking employees after the effective date of this order.</p>

The Administrator may exempt anyone from the charges required by this subsection if he determines that such charges would be infeasible or impractical. To the extent any such exemption is granted, appropriations to the General Services Administration are authorized to reimburse the fund for any loss of revenue.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Charges for space and services furnished by executive agencies; approval of rates by Administrator; credit to appropriation or fund</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services&mdash;the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.</p>
<p class="note-body">Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.</p>
<p class="note-body">The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a <!-- PDFPage:204 -->number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.</p>
<p class="note-body">Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Recent advancements in mobile telecommunications technology present an opportunity for the rapid construction of the Nation's wireless communications infrastructure. As a matter of policy, the Federal Government shall encourage the efficient and timely implementation of such new technologies and the concomitant infrastructure buildout as a means of stimulating economic growth and creating new jobs. The recent auctioning and impending licensing of radio frequencies for mobile personal communications services presents the Federal Government with the opportunity to foster new technologies and to encourage the development of communications infrastructure by making Federal property available for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, I hereby direct the Administrator of General Services, within 90 days, in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Interior, Defense, and the heads of such other agencies as the Administrator may determine, to develop procedures necessary to facilitate appropriate access to Federal property for the siting of mobile services antennas.</p>
<p class="note-body">The procedures should be developed in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">1. (a) Upon request, and to the extent permitted by law and where practicable, executive departments and agencies shall make available Federal Government buildings and lands for the siting of mobile service antennas. This should be done in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and consistent with national security concerns (including minimizing mutual electromagnetic interactions), public health and safety concerns, environmental and aesthetic concerns, preservation of historic buildings and monuments, protection of natural and cultural resources, protection of national park and wilderness values, protection of National Wildlife Refuge systems, and subject to any Federal requirements promulgated by the agency managing the facility and the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Antennas on Federal buildings or land may not contain any advertising.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Federal property does not include lands held by the United States in trust for individual or Native American tribal governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall retain discretion to reject inappropriate siting requests, and assure adequate protection of public property and timely removal of equipment and structures at the end of service.</p>
<p class="note-body">2. All procedures and mechanisms adopted regarding access to Federal property shall be clear and simple so as to facilitate the efficient and rapid buildout of the national wireless communications infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. Unless otherwise prohibited by or inconsistent with Federal law, agencies shall charge fees based on market value for siting antennas on Federal property, and may use competitive procedures if not all applicants can be accommodated.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum does not give the siting of mobile services antennas priority over other authorized uses of Federal buildings or land.</p>
<p class="note-body">All independent regulatory commissions and agencies are requested to comply with the provisions of this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to create any right, benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers, or any other person.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;491. Motor vehicle pools and transportation systems</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to carry out the policy, expressed in section 471 of this title, to provide for an economical and efficient system for transportation of Government personnel and property, it is further intended by the Congress in enacting this section to (1) provide for the proper identification of Government motor vehicles; (2) establish effective means of limiting their use to official governmental purposes; (3) reduce the number of Government-owned vehicles to the minimum necessary for transaction of the public business; <!-- PDFPage:209 -->(4) provide wherever practicable for centrally operated interagency pools or systems for local transportation of Government personnel and property; and (5) establish procedures to insure safe operation of motor vehicles on Government business.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations by Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations issued by the President pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the Administrator shall in respect of executive agencies, and to the extent that he determines that so doing is advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, or service, after consultation with and with due regard to the program activities of the agencies concerned, (1) consolidate, take over, acquire, or arrange for the operation by any executive agency of, motor vehicles and other related equipment and supplies for the purpose of establishing motor vehicle pools and systems to serve the needs of executive agencies; and (2) provide for the establishment, maintenance, and operation (including servicing and storage) of motor vehicle pools or systems for transportation of property or passengers, and for furnishing such motor vehicle and related services to executive agencies. Such motor vehicle services may be furnished, as determined by the Administrator, through the use, under rental or other arrangements, of motor vehicles of private fleet operators, taxicab companies, local or interstate common carriers, or Government-owned motor vehicles, or combinations thereof. The Administrator shall, so far as practicable, provide any of the services specified in this subsection to any Federal agency, mixed ownership corporation (as defined in chapter 91 of title 31), or the District of Columbia, upon its request.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall, within ninety days after the effective date of this section, issue regulations under this section to establish procedures for the taking effect of determinations made by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Such regulations shall provide for adequate notice to executive agencies of any determinations affecting them or their functions; for independent review and decision as directed by the President of any determination not mutually agreed upon between the Administrator and the agency concerned, including exemption of any agency, in whole or in part, from any determination; and for enforcement of determinations becoming effective under such regulations. No determination made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be binding upon any agency except as provided in such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of costs; fixing of prices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The General Supply Fund provided for in section 756 of this title shall be available for use by or under the direction and control of the Administrator for paying all elements of cost (including the purchase or rental price of motor vehicles and other related equipment and supplies) incident to the establishment, maintenance, and operation (including servicing and storage) of motor vehicle pools or systems for the transportation of property or passengers, and to the furnishing of such motor vehicles and equipment and related services pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payments by requisitioning agencies so served shall be at prices fixed by the Administrator at levels which will recover, so far as practicable, all such elements of cost, and may, in the Administrator's discretion, include increments for the estimated replacement cost of such motor vehicles, equipment, and supplies. Such increments may, notwithstanding section 756(e) of this title, be retained as part of the capital of the General Supply Fund, but shall be available only for replacement of such motor vehicles, equipment, and supplies. The purchase price, plus such increments for the estimated replacement cost, of such motor vehicles and equipment shall be recovered only through charges for the cost of amortization. Such costs shall be determined in accordance with the accrual accounting method; and financial reports shall be prepared on the basis of such accounting.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Justification for each vehicle pool and system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination made by the Administrator pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall set forth in writing an analytical justification for the establishment, maintenance, and operation of each such motor vehicle pool and system. Such justification shall include a detailed comparison of estimated costs of present and proposed modes of operation, and a showing that savings can be realized by the establishment, maintenance, and operation of such pool or system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Maintenance records; discontinuance of vehicle pool or system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any such motor vehicle pool or system has been established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall maintain accurate records of the cost of its establishment, maintenance, and operation. If, during any reasonable period, not exceeding two successive fiscal years, no actual savings are realized on the basis of the accounting for costs provided in subsection (d) of this section the Administrator shall discontinue such motor vehicle pool or system, and shall return to the agency or agencies involved motor vehicles and related equipment and supplies similar in kind and of a value reasonably comparable to the value of the motor vehicles and related equipment and supplies theretofore received by the Administrator from such agency or agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reimbursement for equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Administrator takes over pursuant to subsection (b) of this section any motor vehicle or other related equipment or supplies from any Government corporation, or from any other agency if such vehicle, equipment or supplies have been acquired by such agency through expenditures made from, and not theretofore reimbursed to, any revolving or trust fund authorized by law, the Administrator shall reimburse such corporation or fund by an amount equal to the fair market value of the vehicle, equipment or supplies so taken over. If thereafter, pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the Administrator returns to such corporation or agency any motor vehicle, equipment or supplies, the <!-- PDFPage:210 -->Administrator shall be reimbursed by the payment to him, by such corporation or from such fund, of an amount equal to the fair market value of the vehicle, equipment or supplies so returned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Additions to General Supply Fund capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When reimbursement is not required under subsection (g) of this section, the value, as determined by the Administrator, of any motor vehicle or other related equipment or supplies taken over under authority of subsection (b) of this section may be added to the capital of the General Supply Fund, and in the event that property similar in kind is subsequently returned pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the value thereof may be deducted from the General Supply Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Scrip, tokens, tickets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator, in the operation of motor vehicle pools or systems, may make provision for the furnishing, sale, and use of scrip, tokens, tickets, and similar devices for the making of payment by using agencies for services rendered by the Administrator in the transportation of property or passengers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Operating regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall issue regulations to govern executive agencies in authorizing civilian personnel to operate Government-owned motor vehicles for official purposes within the States of the Union, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the possessions of the United States. Such regulations shall prescribe standards of physical fitness for authorized operators and may require operators and prospective operators to obtain such State and local licenses or permits as would be required for the operation by them of similar vehicles for other than official purposes. The head of each executive agency shall issue such orders and directives as may be necessary to comply with such regulations and shall make appropriate provision therein for periodically testing the physical fitness of operators and prospective operators and for the suspension and revocation of authorizations to operate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Identification of vehicles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under regulations prescribed by the Administrator, every motor vehicle acquired and used for official purposes within the United States, its Territories, or possessions, by any Federal agency or the District of Columbia shall be conspicuously identified by showing thereon either (1) the full name of the department, establishment, corporation, or agency by which it is used and the service in which it is used, or (2) a title descriptive of the service in which it is used if such title readily identifies the department, establishment, corporation, or agency concerned, and the legend &ldquo;For official use only&rdquo;: <em>Provided</em>, That the regulations issued pursuant to this section may provide for exemptions from the requirement of this section when conspicuous identification would interfere with the purpose for which a vehicle is acquired and used.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, during the regular course of his duties, there shall come to the knowledge of the Administrator any violation of the provisions of sections 1343, 1344, and 1349(b) of title 31 or of section 641 of title 18 involving the conversion by a Government official or employee of a Government-owned or leased motor vehicle to his own use or the use of others, the Administrator shall report such violation to the head of the agency in which the official or employee concerned is employed, for further investigation and either appropriate disciplinary action under sections 1343, 1344, and 1349(b) of title 31 or, where appropriate, referral to the Attorney General for prosecution under section 641 of title 18.</p>

No appropriations shall be made to lease any space at an av<!-- PDFPage:221 -->erage annual rental in excess of $1,500,000 for use for public purposes if such lease has not been approved by resolutions adopted by the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives. No appropriation shall be made to alter any building, or part thereof, which is under lease by the United States for use for a public purpose if the cost of such alteration would exceed $750,000 unless such alteration has been approved by resolutions adopted by the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives. For the purpose of securing consideration for such approval, the Administrator shall transmit to the Congress a prospectus of the proposed facility, including (but not limited to)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a brief description of the building to be constructed, altered, purchased, acquired, or the space to be leased under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the location of the building or space to be leased and an estimate of the maximum cost to the United States of the facility to be constructed, altered, purchased, acquired, or the space to be leased;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a comprehensive plan for providing space for all Government officers and employees in the locality of the proposed facility or the space to be leased, having due regard for suitable space which may continue to be available in existing Government-owned or occupied buildings, especially such of those buildings as enhance the architectural, historical, social, cultural, and economic environment of the locality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) with respect to any project for the construction, alteration, purchase, or acquisition of any building, a statement by the Administrator that suitable space owned by the Government is not available and that suitable rental space is not available at a price commensurate with that to be afforded through the proposed action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a statement by the Administrator of the economic and other justifications for not acquiring or purchasing a building or buildings identified to the Administrator pursuant to section 611(c) of this title as suitable for the public building needs of the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a statement of rents and other housing costs currently being paid by the Government for Federal agencies to be housed in the building to be constructed, altered, purchased, acquired, or the space to be leased.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Increase of estimated maximum cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The estimated maximum cost of any project approved under this section as set forth in any prospectus may be increased by an amount equal to the percentage increase, if any, as determined by the Administrator, in construction, or alteration costs, as the case may be, from the date of transmittal of such prospectus to Congress, but in no event shall the increase authorized by this subsection exceed 10 per centum of such estimated maximum cost.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rescission of approval for failure to make appropriations for project</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any project approved for construction, alteration, or acquisition by the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, for which an appropriation has not been made within one year after the date of such approval, either of those Committees may rescind, by resolution, its approval of such project at any time thereafter before such an appropriation has been made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Emergency leases by the Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the Administrator from entering into emergency leases during any period declared by the President to require such emergency leasing authority, except that no such emergency lease shall be for a period of more than 180 days without approval of a prospectus for such lease in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) secure or sensitive activities related to the national defense or security, except in any case in which it would be inappropriate to locate such activities in a public building or other facility identified with the United States Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a permanent courtroom, judicial chamber, or administrative office for any United States court;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the average rental cost of leasing such space would exceed $1,500,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may lease any space with respect to which paragraph (1) applies if the Administrator first determines, for reasons set forth in writing, that leasing such space is necessary to meet requirements which cannot be met in public buildings and submits such reasons to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Dollar amount adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any dollar amount referred to in this section and section 603(b) of this title may be adjusted by the Administrator annually to reflect a percentage increase or decrease in construction costs during the preceding calendar year, as determined by the composite index of construction costs of the Department of Commerce. Any such adjustment shall be expeditiously reported to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation and composition of Fund; availability; overhead costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be set aside in the Treasury a special fund which shall be known as the General Supply Fund. Such fund shall be composed of the assets of the general supply fund (including any surplus therein) created by section 3 of the Act of February 27, 1929 (45 Stat. 1342; 41 U.S.C. 7c), and transferred to the Administrator by section 752 of this title, and sums as may be appropriated thereto and the value, as <!-- PDFPage:240 -->determined by the Administrator, of inventories of personal property from time to time transferred to the Administrator by other executive agencies under authority of section 481(a)(2) of this title to the extent that payment is not made or credit allowed therefor, and the fund shall assume all of the liabilities, obligations, and commitments of the general supply fund created by such Act of February 27, 1929. The General Supply Fund shall be available for use by or under the direction and control of the Administrator (1) for procuring personal property (including the purchase from or through the Public Printer, for warehouse issue, of standard forms, blankbook work, standard specifications, and other printed material in common use by Federal agencies not available through the Superintendent of Documents) and nonpersonal services for the use of Federal agencies in the proper discharge of their responsibilities, (2) for paying the purchase price, transportation of personal property and services, and the cost of personal services employed directly in the repair, rehabilitation, and conversion of personal property, and (3) for paying other direct costs of, and indirect costs that are reasonably related to, contracting, procurement, inspection, storage, management, distribution, and accountability of property and nonpersonal services provided by the General Services Administration or by special order through such Administration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments by requisitioning agencies; fixing of prices; advance of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payment by requisitioning agencies shall be at prices fixed by the Administrator. Such prices shall be fixed at levels so as to recover so far as practicable the applicable purchase price, the transportation cost, inventory losses, the cost of personal services employed directly in the repair, rehabilitation, and conversion of personal property, and the cost of amortization and repair of equipment utilized for lease or rent to executive agencies. Such prices shall also include an additional charge to recover properly allocable costs payable by the General Supply Fund under subsection (a)(3) of this section with respect to the supplies or services concerned. Requisitioning agencies shall pay by advance of funds in all cases where it is determined by the Administrator that there is insufficient capital otherwise available in the General Supply Fund. Advances of funds also may be made by agreement between the requisitioning agencies and the Administrator. Where an advance of funds is not made, the General Services Administration shall be reimbursed promptly out of funds of the requisitioning agency in accordance with accounting procedures approved by the Comptroller General: <em>Provided</em>, That in any case where payment shall not have been made by the requisitioning agency within forty-five days after the date of billing by the Administrator or the date on which an actual liability for personal property or services is incurred by the Administrator, whichever is the later, reimbursement may be obtained by the Administrator by the issuance of transfer and counterwarrants, or other lawful transfer documents, supported by itemized invoices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Credits to Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The General Supply Fund shall be credited with all reimbursements, advances of funds, and refunds or recoveries relating to personal property or services procured through the fund, including the net proceeds of disposal of surplus personal property procured through the fund and receipts from carriers and others for loss of, or damage to, personal property procured through the fund; and the same are reappropriated for the purposes of the fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Comptroller General shall make audits of the General Supply Fund in accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 31 and make reports on the results thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional uses of Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the requirements of subsections (a) to (e) of this section, the General Supply Fund also may be used for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services authorized to be acquired by mixed-ownership Government corporations, or by the municipal government of the District of Columbia, or by a requisitioning non-Federal agency when the function of a Federal agency authorized to procure for it is transferred to the General Services Administration.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Administrator to coordinate and provide for purchase, lease and maintenance of equipment by Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator is authorized and directed to coordinate and provide for the economic and efficient purchase, lease, and maintenance of automatic data processing equipment by Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;automatic data processing equipment&rdquo; means any equipment or interconnected system or subsystems of equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching interchange, transmission, or reception, of data or information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by a Federal agency, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) under a contract with a Federal agency which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) requires the use of such equipment, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) requires the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product which is performed or produced making significant use of such equipment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such term includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) computers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) ancillary equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) software, firmware, and similar procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) services, including support services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) related resources as defined by regulations issued by the Administrator for General Services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This section does not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) automatic data processing equipment acquired by a Federal contractor which is incidental to the performance of a Federal contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) radar, sonar, radio, or television equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the procurement by the Department of Defense of automatic data processing equipment or services if the function, operation, or use of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) involves intelligence activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) involves cryptologic activities related to national security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) involves the command and control of military forces;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) involves equipment which is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions, provided that this exclusion shall not include automatic data processing equipment used for routine administrative and business applications such as payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the procurement of automatic data processing equipment or services by the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:245 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procurement, maintenance and repair of equipment; transfer between agencies; joint utilization; establishment and operation of equipment pools and data processing centers; delegation of Administrator's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Automatic data processing equipment suitable for efficient and effective use by Federal agencies shall be provided by the Administrator through purchase, lease, transfer of equipment from other Federal agencies, or otherwise, and the Administrator is authorized and directed to provide by contract or otherwise for the maintenance and repair of such equipment. In carrying out his responsibilities under this section the Administrator is authorized to transfer automatic data processing equipment between Federal agencies, to provide for joint utilization of such equipment by two or more Federal agencies, and to establish and operate equipment pools and data processing centers for the use of two or more such agencies when necessary for its most efficient and effective utilization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may delegate to one or more Federal agencies authority to operate automatic data processing equipment pools and automatic data processing centers, and to lease, purchase, or maintain individual automatic data processing systems or specific units of equipment, including such equipment used in automatic data processing pools and automatic data processing centers, when such action is determined by the Administrator to be necessary for the economy and efficiency of operations, or when such action is essential to national defense or national security. The Administrator may delegate to one or more Federal agencies authority to lease, purchase, or maintain automatic data processing equipment to the extent to which he determines such action to be necessary and desirable to allow for the orderly implementation of a program for the utilization of such equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Administrator finds that a senior official of an agency designated pursuant to section 3506(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#759_1_target" name="759_1">1</a></sup> of title 44 is sufficiently independent of program responsibility and has sufficient experience, resources, and ability to carry out fairly and effectively procurements under this section, the Administrator may delegate to such official the authority to lease, purchase, or maintain automatic data processing equipment pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, except that any such delegation shall not relieve the Administrator of the responsibilities assigned to the Administrator under this section. A delegation by the Administrator under this subsection shall not preclude the Administrator from reviewing individual procurement requests if the Administrator determines that circumstances warrant such a review. The Administrator shall retain authority to revoke such delegations, both in general and with regard to any specific matter, including the authority to revoke a delegation of authority with respect to a particular contract after award of the contract, except that the Administrator may revoke a delegation of authority after the contract is awarded only when there is a finding of a violation of law or regulation in connection with the contract award..<sup><a href="#759_2_target" name="759_2">2</a></sup> In acting for the Administrator, any official to whom approval authority has been delegated under this subsection shall comply fully with the rules and regulations promulgated by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Inapplicability of other inconsistent provisions of law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The proviso following paragraph (4) in section 481(a) of this title and the provisions of section 474(d) of this title shall have no application in the administration of this section. No other provision of this Act or any other Act which is inconsistent with the provisions of this section shall be applicable in the administration of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Standards and guidelines for Federal computer systems; promulgation, disapproval or modification, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Commerce shall, on the basis of standards and guidelines developed by the National Bureau of Standards pursuant to section 278g&ndash;3(a)(2) and (3) of title 15, promulgate standards and guidelines pertaining to Federal computer systems, making such standards compulsory and binding to the extent to which the Secretary determines necessary to improve the efficiency of operation or security and privacy of Federal computer systems. The President may disapprove or modify such standards and guidelines if he determines such action to be in the public interest. The President's authority to disapprove or modify such standards and guidelines may not be delegated. Notice of such disapproval or modification shall be submitted promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the Federal Register. Upon receiving notice of such disapproval or modification, the Secretary of Commerce shall immediately rescind or modify such standards or guidelines as directed by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of a Federal agency may employ standards for the cost-effective security and privacy of sensitive information in a Federal computer system within or under the supervision of that agency that are more stringent than the standards promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce, if such standards contain, at a minimum, the provisions of those applicable standards made compulsory and binding by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The standards determined to be compulsory and binding may be waived by the Secretary of Commerce in writing upon a determination that compliance would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide savings. The Secretary may delegate to the head of one or more Federal agencies authority to waive such standards to the extent to which the Secretary determines such action to be necessary and desirable to allow for timely and effective implementation of Federal computer systems standards. The head of such agency may redelegate such <!-- PDFPage:246 -->authority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of title 44. Notice of each such waiver and delegation shall be transmitted promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Administrator shall revise the Federal information resources management regulations (41 CFR ch. 201) to be consistent with the standards and guidelines promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this subsection, the terms &ldquo;Federal computer system&rdquo; and &ldquo;operator of a Federal computer system&rdquo; have the meanings given in section 278g&ndash;3(d) of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitations on authority of Administrator and Secretary of Commerce; notice and review of Administrator's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authority conferred upon the Administrator and the Secretary of Commerce by this section shall be exercised subject to direction by the President and to fiscal and policy control exercised by the Office of Management and Budget. Authority so conferred upon the Administrator shall not be so construed as to impair or interfere with the determination by agencies of their individual automatic data processing equipment requirements, including the development of specifications for and the selection of the types and configurations of equipment needed. The Administrator shall not interfere with, or attempt to control in any way, the use made of automatic data processing equipment or components thereof by any agency. The Administrator shall provide adequate notice to all agencies and other users concerned with respect to each proposed determination whether or not the automatic data processing equipment will be provided by the Administrator or whether or not the authority to lease, purchase, or maintain the equipment will be delegated. If the Administrator denies an agency procurement request such denial shall be subject to review and decision by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, unless the President otherwise directs. Such review and decision shall be made only on the basis of a written appeal, and such written appeal, together with any written communications to the Administrator or any officer or employee of the Office of Management and Budget concerning such denial shall be made available to the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Automated data processing dispute resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon request of an interested party in connection with any procurement that is subject to this section (including any such procurement that is subject to delegation of procurement authority), the board of contract appeals of the General Services Administration (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;board&rdquo;) shall review, as provided in this subsection, any decision by a contracting officer that is alleged to violate a statute, a regulation, or the conditions of a delegation of procurement authority. Such review shall be conducted under the standard applicable to review of contracting officer final decisions by boards of contract appeals. The authority of the board to conduct such review shall include the authority to determine whether any procurement is subject to this section and the authority to review regulations to determine their consistency with applicable statutes. A proceeding, decision, or order of the board pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to interlocutory appeal or review. An interested party who has filed a protest under subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31, with respect to a procurement or proposed procurement may not file a protest with respect to that procurement or proposed procurement under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) When a protest under this subsection is filed before the award of a contract in a protested procurement, the board, at the request of an interested party and within 10 days of the filing of the protest, shall hold a hearing to determine whether the board should suspend the procurement authority of the Administrator or the Administrator's delegation of procurement authority for the protested procurement on an interim basis until the board can decide the protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The board shall suspend the procurement authority of the Administrator or the Administrator's delegation of procurement authority unless the Federal agency concerned establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) absent action by the board, contract award is likely to occur within 30 days of the hearing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for the decision of the board.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A suspension under this subparagraph shall not preclude the Federal agency concerned from continuing the procurement process up to but not including award of the contract unless the board determines such action is not in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A)(i) If, with respect to an award of a contract, the board receives notice of a protest under this subsection within the period described in clause (ii), the board shall, at the request of an interested party, hold a hearing to determine whether the board should suspend the procurement authority of the Administrator or the Administrator's delegation of procurement authority for the protested procurement on an interim basis until the board can decide the protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The period referred to in clause (i) is the period beginning on the date on which the contract is awarded and ending at the end of the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the tenth day after the date of contract award; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the fifth day after the debriefing date offered to an unsuccessful offeror for any debriefing that is requested and, when requested, is required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The board shall hold the requested hearing within 5 days after the date of the filing of the protest or, in the case of a request for debriefing under the provisions of section 2305(b)(5) of title 10 or section 303B(e) of this Act [41 U.S.C. 253b(e)], within 5 days after the later of the date of the filing of the protest or the date of the debriefing.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:247 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The board shall suspend the procurement authority of the Administrator or the Administrator's delegation of procurement authority to acquire any goods or services under the contract which are not previously delivered and accepted unless the Federal agency concerned establishes that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for the decision of the board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The board shall conduct such proceedings and allow such discovery as may be required for the expeditious, fair, and reasonable resolution of the protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to any deadlines imposed by section 9(a) of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 608(a)), the board shall give priority to protests filed under this subsection. The board shall issue its final decision within 65 days after the date of the filing of the protest, unless the board's chairman determines that the specific and unique circumstances of the protest require a longer period, in which case the board shall issue such decision within the longer period determined by the chairman. An amendment which adds a new ground of protest should be resolved, to the maximum extent practicable, within the time limits established for resolution of the initial protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The board may dismiss a protest that the board determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is frivolous;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) has been brought or pursued in bad faith; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) does not state on its face a valid basis for protest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In making a decision on the merits of protests brought under this section, the board shall accord due weight to the policies of this section and the goals of economic and efficient procurement set forth in this section. The board may consider any decision, determination, opinion, or statement made by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget or any officer of any other Federal agency regarding applicability of this section to a particular procurement, and may request the advice of the Director or such officer with regard to such applicability, but shall not be bound by any such decision, determination, opinion, or statement when determining whether a procurement is subject to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the board determines that a challenged agency action violates a statute or regulation or the conditions of any delegation of procurement authority issued pursuant to this section, the board may suspend, revoke, or revise the procurement authority of the Administrator or the Administrator's delegation of procurement authority applicable to the challenged procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Whenever the board makes such a determination, it may, in accordance with section 1304 of title 31, further declare an appropriate prevailing party to be entitled to the cost of filing and pursuing the protest (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and consultant and expert witness fees), and bid and proposal preparation. However, no party (other than a small business concern (within the meaning of section 632(a) of title 15)) may be declared entitled to costs for consultants and expert witness fees that exceed the highest rate of compensation for expert witnesses paid by the Federal Government, and no party (other than a small business concern (within the meaning of section 632(a) of title 15)) may be declared entitled to attorneys&rsquo; fees that exceed $150 per hour unless the board, on a case by case basis, determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Any agreement that provides for the dismissal of a protest and involves a direct or indirect expenditure of appropriated funds shall be submitted to the board and shall be made a part of the public record (subject to any protective order considered appropriate by the board) before dismissal of the protest. If a Federal agency is a party to a settlement agreement, the submission of the agreement to the board shall include a memorandum, signed by the contracting officer concerned, that describes in detail the procurement, the grounds for protest, the Federal Government's position regarding the grounds for protest, the terms of the settlement, and the agency's position regarding the propriety of the award or proposed award of the contract at issue in the protest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Payment of amounts due from an agency under subparagraph (C) or under the terms of a settlement agreement under subparagraph (D) shall be made from the appropriation made by section 1304 of title 31 for the payment of judgments. The Federal agency concerned shall reimburse that appropriation account out of funds available for the procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The final decision of the board may be appealed by the head of the Federal agency concerned and by any interested party, including interested parties who intervene in any protest filed under this subsection, as set forth in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the board revokes, suspends, or revises the procurement authority of the Administrator or the Administrator's delegation of procurement authority after the contract award, the affected contract shall be presumed valid as to all goods or services delivered and accepted under the contract before the suspension, revocation, or revision of such procurement authority or delegation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing contained in this subsection shall affect the board's power to order any additional relief which it is authorized to provide under any statute or regulation.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the use of rail passenger service to and from Washington, District of Columbia, declining when the National Visitor Center Facilities Act of 1968 [this chapter] was enacted, has dramatically increased since that time with the advent of and substantial Federal investment in the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and the northeast corridor improvement project, justifying a reversal of the policy adopted 13 years ago;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the historic Union Station building is now unsafe and unusable, and the replacement railroad station is inconvenient and inadequate for present and projected rail ridership demand;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is in the national interest to build a Federal building complex and establish an international cultural and trade center on the Federal Triangle property in the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) development of such a Federal building complex will permit consolidation of a number of Federal agencies which are currently housed in numerous, scattered locations and will enable more economical and efficient use of building space and environs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) inclusion of an international cultural and trade center within the Federal building complex will create and enhance opportunities for American trade, commerce, communications, and cultural exchanges with other nations and complement the work of Federal, State, and local agencies in the areas of international trade and cultural exchange; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the appropriate development, maintenance, and use of the Federal Triangle property should be a joint development effort of the General Services Administration, the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, and the International Cultural and Trade Center Commission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To transfer the Federal Triangle property from the Administrator of General Services to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To grant to the Corporation the power of eminent domain to acquire certain properties and rights-of-way adjacent to the Federal Triangle site and to authorize the Corporation to exercise such power as may be necessary to further the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To authorize the Corporation, after consultation with the Secretary of State, the Administrator, and the Commission, to prepare plans for development of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To establish a process for review and selection of such plans and, after completion of such review process, to authorize the Corporation to enter into an agreement with a private developer selected for the development of such property.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To ensure that the design and construction of the Federal building complex on such property will insofar as practicable be in accordance with the guiding principles for Federal architecture recommended by the Committee on Federal Office Space in 1962 which require among other things that facilities to <!-- PDFPage:285 -->be used by Federal agencies be efficient and economical and that public buildings provide visual testimony to the dignity, enterprise, vigor, and stability of the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To provide for establishment, operation, and maintenance of a self-sustaining international cultural and trade center in such complex.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal legislation is necessary under Article I of section 8 of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to adopt standards governing arbitration which must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Factors in making arbitration award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdictions in the Washington, D.C. standard metropolitan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurance, and pensions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the continuity and stability of employment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The public welfare.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compact agency's funding ability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the interstate compact agency's funding ability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for final award</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In resolving a dispute submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section have been considered and applied. An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare. The arbitrator's conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an arbitration award to which section 1303 of this title applies, the interstate compact agency and the employees in the bargaining unit, through their representative, may agree in writing upon any modifications to the award within 10 days after the award is received by the parties. After the end of that 10-day period, the award, with any such modifications, shall become binding upon the interstate compact agency, the employees in the bargaining unit, and the employees&rsquo; representative.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Each party to an award that becomes binding under subsection (a) of this section shall take all actions necessary to implement the award.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a) of this section, the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may file a civil action in a court which has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a hearing, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the award is in violation of applicable law;</p>
