<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this title, the Federal-aid systems are the Interstate System and the National Highway System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>National Highway System.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of the National Highway System is to provide an interconnected system of principal arterial routes which will serve major population centers, international border crossings, ports, airports, public transportation facilities, and other intermodal transportation facilities and other major travel destinations; meet national defense requirements; and serve interstate and interregional travel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Components</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The National Highway System shall consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Highways designated as part of the Interstate System under subsection (e) and section 139 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Other urban and rural principal arterials and highways (including toll facilities) which provide motor vehicle access between such an arterial and a major port, airport, public transportation facility, or other intermodal transportation facility. The States, in cooperation with local and regional officials, shall propose to the Secretary arterials and highways for designation to the National Highway System under this paragraph. In urbanized areas, the local officials shall act through the metropolitan planning organizations designated for such areas under section 134 of this title. The routes on the National Highway System, as shown on the map submitted by the Secretary to the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate in 1991, illustrating the National Highway System, shall serve as the basis for the States in proposing arterials and highways for designation to such system. The Secretary may modify or revise such proposals and submit such modified or revised proposals to Congress for approval in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A strategic highway network which is a network of highways which are important to the United States strategic defense policy and which provide defense access, continuity, and emergency capabilities for the movement of personnel, materiels, and equipment in both peace time and war time. Such highways may include highways on and off the Interstate System and shall be designated by the Secretary in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and the States and be subject to approval by Congress in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Major strategic highway network connectors which are highways that provide motor vehicle access between major military installations and highways which are part of the strategic highway network. Such highways shall be designated by the Secretary in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and the States and subject to approval by Congress in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Approval of designations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Proposed designations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall submit for approval to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives a proposed National Highway System with a list and description of highways proposed to be designated to the National Highway System under this subsection and a map showing such proposed designations. In preparing the proposed system, the Secretary shall consult appropriate local officials and shall use the functional reclassification of roads and streets carried out under subsection (c) of section 1006 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Approval of congress required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After September 30, 1995, no funds made available for carrying out this title may be apportioned for the National Highway System or the Interstate maintenance program under this title unless a law has been approved designating the National Highway System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Maximum mileage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of proposing highways for designation to the National Highway System, the mileage of highways on the National Highway System shall not exceed 155,000 miles; except that the Secretary may increase or decrease such maximum mileage by not to exceed 15 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Equitable allocations of highway mileage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In proposing highways for designation to the National Highway System, the Secretary shall provide for equitable allocation of highway mileage among the States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Interim system</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, highways classified as principal arterials by the States shall be treated as being on the National Highway System for purposes of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Designation; mileage limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Interstate System shall be designated within the United States, including the District of Columbia, and, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, it shall not exceed forty-one thousand miles in total extent. It shall be so located as to connect by routes, as direct as practicable, the principal metropolitan areas, cities, and industrial centers, to serve the national defense, and to the greatest extent possible, to connect at suitable border points with routes of continental importance in the Dominion of Canada and the Republic of Mexico. The routes of this system, to the greatest extent possible, shall be se<!-- PDFPage:19 -->lected by joint action of the State highway departments of each State and the adjoining States, subject to the approval by the Secretary as provided in subsection (f) of this section. All highways or routes included in the Interstate System as finally approved, if not already coincident with the primary system, shall be added to said system without regard to the mileage limitation set forth in subsection (b) of this section. This system may be located both in rural and urban areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Modifications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the mileage authorized by the first sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection, there is hereby authorized additional mileage for the Interstate System of five hundred miles, to be used in making modifications or revisions in the Interstate System as provided in this paragraph. Upon the request of a State highway department the Secretary may withdraw his approval of any route or portion thereof on the Interstate System within that State selected and approved in accordance with this title, if he determines that such route or portion thereof is not essential to completion of a unified and connected Interstate System (including urban routes necessary for metropolitan transportation) and will not be constructed as a part of the Interstate System, and if he receives assurances that the State does not intend to construct a toll road in the traffic corridor which would be served by such route or portion thereof. After the Secretary has withdrawn his approval of any such route or portion thereof the mileage of such route or portion thereof and the additional mileage authorized by the first sentence of this paragraph shall be available for the designation of interstate routes or portions thereof as provided in this subsection. The provisions of this title applicable to the Interstate System shall apply to all mileage designated under the third sentence of this paragraph. The Secretary shall not designate any Interstate route or portion thereof under authority of this paragraph after the date of enactment of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Additional mileage for improved efficiency</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In addition to the mileage authorized by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, there is hereby authorized additional mileage of not to exceed 1,500 miles for the designation of routes in the same manner as set forth in paragraph (1), in order to improve the efficiency and service of the Interstate System to better accomplish the purposes of that System.</p>

The mileage of the route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph shall be available for designation on the Interstate System in any other State in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection. After the Secretary has withdrawn his approval of any such route or portion thereof, whenever responsible local officials of such urbanized area notify the State highway department that, in lieu of a route or portion thereof approval for which is withdrawn under this paragraph, their needs require a nonhighway public mass transit project involving the construction of fixed rail facilities, or the purchase of passenger equipment, including rolling stock for any mode of mass transit, or both, and the State highway department determines that such public mass transit project is in accordance with the planning process under section 134 of this title and is entitled to priority under such planning process, such public mass transit project shall be submitted for approval to the Secretary. Approval of the plans, specifications, and estimates for such project by the Secretary shall be deemed a contractual obligation of the United States for payment out of the general funds in the Treasury of its proportional share of the cost of such project in an amount equal to the Federal share which would be paid for such a project under the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 [section 1601 et seq. of Title 49, Transportation], except that the total Federal cost of all such projects under this paragraph with respect to such route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph, shall not exceed the Federal share of the cost which would have been paid for such route or portion thereof, as such cost is included in the 1972 Interstate System cost estimate set forth in table 5 of House Public Works Committee Print Numbered 92&ndash;29, as revised in House Report Numbered 92&ndash;1443, increased or decreased, as the case may be, as determined by the Secretary, based on changes in construction costs of such route or portion thereof as of the date of withdrawal of approval under this paragraph and in accordance with that design of such route or portion thereof which is the basis of such 1972 cost estimate. Funds apportioned to such State for the Interstate System, which apportionment is based upon an Interstate System cost estimate that includes a route or portion thereof approval of which is withdrawn under this paragraph, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Federal share of such project as such share becomes a contractual obligation of the United States. No general funds shall be obligated under authority of this paragraph after June 30, 1981. No nonhighway public mass transit project shall be approved under this paragraph unless the Secretary has received assurances satisfactory to him from the State that public mass transportation systems will fully utilize the proposed project. The provision of assistance under this paragraph shall not be construed as bringing within the application of chapter 15 of title 5, United States Code [section 1501 et seq. of Title 5, Government Organization and Employees], any nonsupervisory employee of an urban mass transportation system (or of any other agency or entity performing related functions) to whom such chapter is otherwise inapplicable.

The agreement between the Secretary and the State highway department for the reimbursement of the cost of such rights-of-way shall provide for the actual construction of a road on such rights-of-way within a period not exceeding 20 years following the fiscal year in which such request is made unless a longer period is determined to be reasonable by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Federal participation in the cost of rights-of-way acquired under subsection (a) of this section shall not exceed the Federal pro rata share applicable to the class of funds from which Federal reimbursement is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a revolving fund to be known as the right-of-way revolving fund which shall be administered by the Secretary in carrying out the provisions of this subsection. Sums authorized to be appropriated to the right-of-way revolving fund shall be available for expenditure without regard to the fiscal year for which such sums are authorized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of acquiring rights-of-way for future construction of highways and passenger transit facilities on any Federal-aid system and for making payments for the moving or relocation of persons, businesses, farms, and other existing uses of real property caused by the acquisition of such rights-of-way, in addition to the authority contained in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary, upon request of a State highway department, is authorized to advance funds, without interest, to the State from amounts available in the right-of-way revolving fund, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Funds so advanced may be used to pay the entire costs of projects for the acquisition of rights-of-way, including the net cost to the State of property management, if any, and related moving and relocation payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Actual construction of a project on rights-of-way, with respect to which funds are advanced under this subsection, shall be commenced within a period of not less than two years nor more than 20 years following the end of the fiscal year in which the Secretary approves such advance of funds, unless the Secretary, in his discretion, shall provide for an earlier or later termination date. Immediately upon the termination of the period of time within which actual construction must be commenced, in the case of any project where such construction is not commenced before such termination, or upon approval by the Secretary of the plans, specifications, and estimates for such project for the actual construction of a project on rights-of-way with respect to which funds are advanced under this subsection, whichever shall occur first, the right-of-way revolving fund shall be credited with an amount equal to the Federal share of the funds advanced, as provided in section 120 of this title, out of any Federal-aid highway funds apportioned to the State in which such project is located and available for obligation for projects of the type funded and the State shall reimburse the Secretary in an amount equal to the non-Federal share of the funds advanced for deposit in, and credit to, the right-of-way revolving fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) It is the intent of Congress that any project for resurfacing, restoring, or rehabilitating any highway, other than a highway access to which is fully controlled, in which Federal funds participate shall be constructed in accordance with standards to preserve and extend the service life of highways and enhance highway safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(p) <cap-smallcap>Compliance With State Laws for Non-NHS Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Projects (other than highway projects on the National Highway System) shall be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with State laws, regulations, directives, safety standards, design standards, and construction standards.</p>

The sums so advanced shall be deposited in a special revolving trust fund, by the State official authorized under the laws of the State to receive Federal-aid highway funds, to be disbursed solely upon vouchers approved by the State highway department for rights-of-way which have been or are being acquired, and for construction which has been actually performed and approved by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter. Upon determination by the Secretary that any part of the funds advanced to any State under the provisions of this section are no longer required, the amount of the advance, which is determined to be in excess of current requirements of the State, shall be repaid upon his demand, and such repayments shall be returned to the credit of the appropriation from which the funds were advanced.

In no event shall funds be used pursuant to this section for the repair or reconstruction of bridges which have been permanently closed to all vehicular traffic by the State or responsible local official because of imminent danger of collapse due to structural deficiencies or physical deterioration. Subject to the following limitations, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund such sums as may be necessary to establish the fund authorized by this section and to replenish it on an annual basis: (1) Not more than $50,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any fiscal year ending before July 1, 1972, and not more than $100,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any one fiscal year commencing after June 30, 1972, and ending before June 1, 1976, to carry out the provisions of this section and an additional amount not to exceed $100,000,000 is further authorized to be expended in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, to carry out the provisions of this section, and not more than $25,000,000 for the three-month period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, is authorized to be expended to carry out the provisions of this section, and not more than $100,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any one fiscal year commencing after September 30, 1976, and not more than $100,000,000 is authorized to be expended in any one fiscal year commencing after September 30, 1980, to carry out the provisions of this section, except that, if in any fiscal year the total of all expenditures under this section is less than the amount authorized to be expended in such fiscal year, the unexpended balance of such amount shall remain available for expenditure during the next two succeeding fiscal years in addition to amounts otherwise available to carry out this section in such years, and (2) prior to the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, 60 per centum of the expenditures under this section for any fiscal year are authorized to be appropriated from the Highway Trust Fund and the remaining 40 per centum of such expenditures are authorized to be appropriated only from any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and for any fiscal year thereafter, 100 per centum of such expenditures are authorized to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund. For the purposes of this section the period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, shall be deemed to be a part of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1977. Pending such appropriation or replenishment the Secretary may expend from any funds heretofore or hereafter appropriated for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this title, including existing Federal-aid appropriations, such sums as may be necessary for the immediate prosecution of the work herein authorized, such appropriations to be reimbursed from the appropriations herein authorized when made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) reconstruction or replacement of a toll-free bridge or tunnel and conversion of the bridge or tunnel to a toll facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) reconstruction of a toll-free Federal-aid highway (other than a highway on the Interstate System) and conversion of the highway to a toll facility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) preliminary studies to determine the feasibility of a toll facility for which Federal participation is authorized under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">on the same basis and in the same manner as in the construction of free highways under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Ownership</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto constructed under this subsection must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be publicly owned, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be privately owned if the public authority having jurisdiction over the highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach has entered into a contract with a private person or persons to design, finance, construct, and operate the facility and the public authority will be responsible for complying with all applicable requirements of this title with respect to the facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on use of revenues</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before the Secretary may permit Federal participation under this subsection in construction of a highway, bridge, or tunnel located in a State, the public authority (including the State transportation department) having jurisdiction over the highway, bridge, or tunnel must enter into an agreement with the Secretary which provides that all toll revenues received from operation of the toll facility will be used first for debt service, for reasonable return on investment of any private person financing the project, and for the costs necessary for the proper operation and maintenance of the toll facility, including reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation. If the State certifies annually that the tolled facility is being adequately maintained, the State may use any toll revenues in excess of amounts required under the preceding sentence for any purpose for which Federal funds may be obligated by a State under this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel under the jurisdiction of a public authority of a State (other than the State transportation department), upon request of the State transportation department and subject to such terms and conditions as such department and public authority may agree, the Secretary shall reimburse such public authority for the Federal share of the costs of construction of the project carried out on the toll facility under this subsection in the same manner and to the same extent as such department would be reimbursed if such project was being carried out by such department. The reimbursement of funds under this paragraph shall be from sums apportioned to the State under this chapter and available for obligations on projects on the Federal-aid system in such State on which the project is being carried out.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on federal share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the Federal share payable for construction of a highway, bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto or conversion of a highway, bridge, or tunnel to a toll facility under this subsection shall be such percentage as the State determines but not to exceed 50 percent. The Federal share payable for construction of a new bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto or for reconstruction or replacement of a bridge, tunnel, or approach thereto shall be such percentage as the Secretary determines but not to exceed 80 percent. In the case of a toll facility subject to an agreement under section 119 or 129, the Federal share payable on any project for resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, or reconstructing such facility shall be 80 percent until the scheduled expiration of such agreement (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Modifications</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If a public authority (including a State transportation department) having jurisdiction over a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel subject to an agreement under this section or section 119(e), as in effect on the day before the effective date of title I of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, requests modification of such agreement, the Secretary shall modify such agreement to allow the continuation of tolls in accordance with paragraph (3) without repayment of Federal funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Loans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A State may loan all or part of the Federal share of a toll project under this section to a public or private agency constructing a toll facility. Such loan may be made only after all Federal environmental requirements have been complied with and permits obtained. The amount loaned shall be subordinated to other debt financing for the facility except for loans made by the State or any other public agency to the agency constructing the facility. Funds loaned pursuant to this section may be obligated for projects eligible under this section. The repayment of any such loan shall commence not more than 5 years after the facility has opened to traffic. Any such loan shall bear interest at the average rate the State's pooled investment fund earned in the 52 weeks preceding the start of repayment. The term of any such loan shall not exceed 30 years from the time the loan was obligated. Amounts repaid to a State from any loan made under this section may be obligated for any purpose for which the loaned funds were available. The Secretary shall establish procedures and guidelines for making such loans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The operation of the ferry shall be on a route classified as a public road within the State and which has not been designated as a route on the Interstate System. Projects under this subsection may be eligible for both ferry boats carrying cars and passengers and ferry boats carrying passengers only.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Such ferry boat or ferry terminal facility shall be publicly owned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The operating authority and the amount of fares charged for passage on such ferry shall be under the control of the State or other public entity, and all revenues derived therefrom shall be applied to actual and necessary costs of operation, maintenance, and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#129_1_target" name="129_1">1</a></sup> repair, debt service, negotiated management fees, and, in the case of a privately operated toll ferry, for a reasonable rate of return.</p>

Except with respect to operations between the islands which comprise the State of Hawaii and operations between the islands which comprise the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and operations between any two points in Alaska and between Alaska and Washington, including stops at appropriate points in the Dominion of Canada, no part of such ferry operation shall be in any foreign or international waters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) No such ferry shall be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of without the approval of the Secretary. The Federal share of any proceeds from such a disposition shall be credited to the unprogramed balance of Federal-aid highway funds of the same class last apportioned to such State. Any amount so credited shall be in addition to all other funds then apportioned to such State and available for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this title.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on number of facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may only permit Federal participation under this subsection in 9 facilities. One of such facilities shall be carried out in each of the following: Orange County, California, the State of Texas, the States of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the State of Florida, States&nbsp;<sup><a href="#129_2_target" name="129_2">2</a></sup> of Georgia and West Virginia, and the State of South Carolina.

The Governor of the States of Pennsylvania and West Virginia shall select the facility to be carried out in such State. The toll facility in Orange County, California, may be located in more than 1 highway corridor to relieve congestion on existing interstate routes in such County.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Limitation on federal share</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal share payable for the construction or reconstruction of a toll highway, bridge, or tunnel under this subsection shall not exceed 35 percent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided in subsection (d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#130_1_target" name="130_1">1</a></sup> of section 120 of this title and subsection (b) of this section, the entire cost of construction of projects for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings, including the separation or protection of grades at crossings, the reconstruction of existing railroad grade crossing structures, and the relocation of highways to eliminate grade crossings, may be paid from sums apportioned in accordance with section 104 of this title. In any case when the elimination of the hazards of a railway-highway crossing can be effected by the relocation of a portion of a railway at a cost estimated by the Secretary to be less than the cost of such elimination by one of the methods mentioned in the first sentence of this section, then the entire cost of such relocation project, except as provided in subsection (d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#130_1_target" name="130_1">1</a></sup> of section 120 of this title and subsection (b) of this section, may be paid from sums apportioned in accordance with section 104 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary may classify the various types of projects involved in the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings, and may set for each such classification a percentage of the costs of construction which shall be deemed to represent the net benefit to the railroad or railroads for the purpose of determining the railroad's share of the cost of construction. The percentage so determined shall in no case exceed 10 per centum. The Secretary shall determine the appropriate classification of each project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Any railroad involved in a project for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings paid for in whole or in part from sums made available for expenditure under this title, or prior Acts, shall be liable to the United States for the net benefit to the railroad determined under the classification of such project made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Such liability to the United States may be discharged by direct payment to the State highway department of the State in which the project is located, in which case such payment shall be credited to the cost of the project. Such payment may consist in whole or in part of materials and labor furnished by the railroad in connection with the construction of such project. If any such railroad fails to discharge such liability within a six-month period after completion of the project, it shall be liable to the United States for its share of the cost, and the Secretary shall request the Attorney General to institute proceedings against such railroad for the recovery of the amount for which it is liable under this subsection. The Attorney General is authorized to bring such proceedings on behalf of the United States, in the appropriate district court of the United States, and the United States shall be entitled in such proceedings to recover such sums as it is considered and adjudged by the court that such railroad is liable for in the premises. Any amounts recovered by the United States under this subsection shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Survey and Schedule of Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each State shall conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all highways to identify those railroad crossings which may require separation, relocation, or protective devices, and establish and implement a schedule of projects for this purpose. At a minimum, such a schedule <!-- PDFPage:85 -->shall provide signs for all railway-highway crossings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Funds for Protective Devices</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At least 1/2 of the funds authorized for and expended under this section shall be available for the installation of protective devices at railway-highway crossings. Sums authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be available for obligation in the same manner as funds apportioned under section 104(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Apportionment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Twenty-five percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be apportioned to the States in the same manner as sums are apportioned under section 104(b)(2) of this title, 25 percent of such funds shall be apportioned to the States in the same manner as sums are apportioned under section 104(b)(6) of this title, and 50 percent of such funds shall be apportioned to the States in the ratio that total railway-highway crossings in each State bears to the total of such crossings in all States. The Federal share payable on account of any project financed with funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be 90 percent of the cost thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Annual Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each State shall report to the Secretary not later than December 30 of each year on the progress being made to implement the railway-highway crossings program authorized by this section and the effectiveness of such improvements. Each State report shall contain an assessment of the costs of the various treatments employed and subsequent accident experience at improved locations. The Secretary shall submit a report to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives not later than April 1 of each year, on the progress being made by the State in implementing projects to improve railway-highway crossings. The report shall include, but not be limited to, the number of projects undertaken, their distribution by cost range, road system, nature of treatment, and subsequent accident experience at improved locations. In addition, the Secretary's report shall analyze and evaluate each State program, identify any State found not to be in compliance with the schedule of improvements required by subsection (d) and include recommendations for future implementation of the railroad highway&nbsp;<sup><a href="#130_2_target" name="130_2">2</a></sup> crossings program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Use of Funds for Matching</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section may be used to provide a local government with funds to be used on a matching basis when State funds are available which may only be spent when the local government produces matching funds for the improvement of railway-highway crossings.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in areas adjacent to the Interstate System and the primary system should be controlled in order to protect the public investment in such highways, to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel, and to preserve natural beauty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Federal-aid highway funds apportioned on or after January 1, 1968, to any State which the Secretary determines has not made provision for effective control of the erection and maintenance along the Interstate System and the primary system of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which are within six hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main traveled way of the system, and Federal-aid highway funds apportioned on or after January 1, 1975, or after the expiration of the next regular session of the State legislature, whichever is later, to any State which the Secretary determines has not made provision for effective control of the erection and maintenance along the Interstate System and the primary system of those additional outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which are more than six hundred and sixty feet off the nearest edge of the right-of-way, located outside of urban areas, visible from the main traveled way of the system, and erected with the purpose of their message being read from such main traveled way, shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per centum of the amounts which would otherwise be apportioned to such State under section 104 of this title, until such time as such State shall provide for such effective control. Any amount which is withheld from apportionment to any State hereunder shall be reapportioned to the other States. Whenever he determines it to be in the public interest, the Secretary may suspend, for such periods as he deems necessary, the application of this subsection to a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Effective control means that such signs, displays, or devices after January 1, 1968, if located within six hundred and sixty feet of the right-of-way and, on or after July 1, 1975, or after the expiration of the next regular session of the State legislature, whichever is later, if located beyond six hundred and sixty feet of the right-of-way located outside of urban areas, visible from the main traveled way of the system, and erected with the purpose of their message being read from such main traveled way, shall, pursuant to this section, be limited to (1) directional and official signs and notices, which signs and notices shall include, but not be limited to, signs and notices pertaining to natural wonders, scenic and historical attractions, which are required or authorized by law, which shall conform to national standards hereby authorized to be promulgated by the Secretary hereunder, which standards shall contain provisions concerning lighting, size, number, and spacing of signs, and such other requirements as may be appropriate to implement this section, (2) signs, displays, and devices advertising the sale or lease of property upon which they are located, (3) signs, displays, and devices, including those which may be changed at reasonable intervals by electronic process or by remote control, advertising activities conducted on the property on which they are located, (4) signs lawfully in existence on October 22, 1965, determined by the State subject to the approval of the Secretary, to be landmark signs, including signs on farm structures or natural surfaces, or historic or artistic significance the preservation of which would be consistent with the purposes of this section, and (5) signs, displays, and devices advertising the distribution by nonprofit organiza<!-- PDFPage:88 -->tions of free coffee to individuals traveling on the Interstate System or the primary system. For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;free coffee&rdquo; shall include coffee for which a donation may be made, but is not required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In order to promote the reasonable, orderly and effective display of outdoor advertising while remaining consistent with the purposes of this section, signs, displays, and devices whose size, lighting and spacing, consistent with customary use is to be determined by agreement between the several States and the Secretary, may be erected and maintained within six hundred and sixty feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way within areas adjacent to the Interstate and primary systems which are zoned industrial or commercial under authority of State law, or in unzoned commercial or industrial areas as may be determined by agreement between the several States and the Secretary. The States shall have full authority under their own zoning laws to zone areas for commercial or industrial purposes, and the actions of the States in this regard will be accepted for the purposes of this Act. Whenever a bona fide State, county, or local zoning authority has made a determination of customary use, such determination will be accepted in lieu of controls by agreement in the zoned commercial and industrial areas within the geographical jurisdiction of such authority. Nothing in this subsection shall apply to signs, displays, and devices referred to in clauses (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Any sign, display, or device lawfully in existence along the Interstate System or the Federal-aid primary system on September 1, 1965, which does not conform to this section shall not be required to be removed until July 1, 1970. Any other sign, display, or device lawfully erected which does not conform to this section shall not be required to be removed until the end of the fifth year after it becomes nonconforming.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary shall, in consultation with the States, provide within the rights-of-way for areas at appropriate distances from interchanges on the Interstate System, on which signs, displays, and devices giving specific information in the interest of the traveling public may be erected and maintained. The Secretary may also, in consultation with the States, provide within the rights-of-way of the primary system for areas in which signs, displays, and devices giving specific information in the interest of the traveling public may be erected and maintained. Such signs shall conform to national standards to be promulgated by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Just compensation shall be paid upon the removal of any outdoor advertising sign, display, or device lawfully erected under State law and not permitted under subsection (c) of this section, whether or not removed pursuant to or because of this section. The Federal share of such compensation shall be 75 per centum. Such compensation shall be paid for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The taking from the owner of such sign, display, or device of all right, title, leasehold, and interest in such sign, display, or device; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The taking from the owner of the real property on which the sign, display, or device is located, of the right to erect and maintain such signs, displays, and devices thereon.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) All public lands or reservations of the United States which are adjacent to any portion of the Interstate System and the primary system shall be controlled in accordance with the provisions of this section and the national standards promulgated by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) In order to provide information in the specific interest of the traveling public, the State highway departments are authorized to maintain maps and to permit information directories and advertising pamphlets to be made available at safety rest areas. Subject to the approval of the Secretary, a State may also establish information centers at safety rest areas and other travel information systems within the rights-of-way for the purpose of informing the public of places of interest within the State and providing such other information as a State may consider desirable. The Federal share of the cost of establishing such an information center or travel information system shall be that which is provided in section 120 for a highway project on that Federal-aid system to be served by such center or system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Any State highway department which has, under this section as in effect on June 30, 1965, entered into an agreement with the Secretary to control the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in areas adjacent to the Interstate System shall be entitled to receive the bonus payments as set forth in the agreement, but no such State highway department shall be entitled to such payments unless the State maintains the control required under such agreement: <em>Provided</em>, That permission by a State to erect and maintain information displays which may be changed at reasonable intervals by electronic process or remote control and which provide public service information or advertise activities conducted on the property on which they are located shall not be considered a breach of such agreement or the control required thereunder. Such payments shall be paid only from appropriations made to carry out this section. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to exempt any State from controlling outdoor advertising as otherwise provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Subject to compliance with subsection (g) of this section for the payment of just compensation, nothing in this section shall prohibit a State from establishing standards imposing stricter limitations with respect to signs, displays, and devices on the Federal-aid highway systems than those established under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) Not less than sixty days before making a final determination to withhold funds from a State under subsection (b) of this section, or to do so under subsection (b) of section 136, or with respect to failing to agree as to the size, lighting, and spacing of signs, displays, and devices or as to unzoned commercial or industrial areas in which signs, displays, and devices may be erected and maintained under subsection (d) of this section, or with respect to failure to approve under subsection (g) of section 136, the Secretary shall give written notice to the State of his proposed determination and a statement <!-- PDFPage:89 -->of the reasons therefor, and during such period shall give the State an opportunity for a hearing on such determination. Following such hearing the Secretary shall issue a written order setting forth his final determination and shall furnish a copy of such order to the State. Within forty-five days of receipt of such order, the State may appeal such order to any United States district court for such State, and upon the filing of such appeal such order shall be stayed until final judgment has been entered on such appeal. Summons may be served at any place in the United States. The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the determination of the Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the State is located and to the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in title 28, United States Code, section 1254. If any part of an apportionment to a State is withheld by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section or subsection (b) of section 136, the amount so withheld shall not be reapportioned to the other States as long as a suit brought by such State under this subsection is pending. Such amount shall remain available for apportionment in accordance with the final judgment and this subsection. Funds withheld from apportionment and subsequently apportioned or reapportioned under this section shall be available for expenditure for three full fiscal years after the date of such apportionment or reapportionment as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this section, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966, not to exceed $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, not to exceed $2,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, not to exceed $27,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, not to exceed $20,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, and not to exceed $50,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973. The provisions of this chapter relating to the obligation, period of availability and expenditure of Federal-aid primary highway funds shall apply to the funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section after June 30, 1967. Subject to approval by the Secretary in accordance with the program of projects approval process of section 105, a State may use any funds apportioned to it under section 104 of this title for removal of any sign, display, or device lawfully erected which does not conform to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) No sign, display, or device shall be required to be removed under this section if the Federal share of the just compensation to be paid upon removal of such sign, display, or device is not available to make such payment. Funds apportioned to a State under section 104 of this title shall not be treated for purposes of the preceding sentence as being available to the State for making such a payment except to the extent that the State, in its discretion, expends such funds for such a payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) The Secretary may approve the request of a State to permit retention in specific areas defined by such State of directional signs, displays, and devices lawfully erected under State law in force at the time of their erection which do not conform to the requirements of subsection (c), where such signs, displays, and devices are in existence on the date of enactment of this subsection and where the State demonstrates that such signs, displays, and devices (1) provide directional information about goods and services in the interest of the traveling public, and (2) are such that removal would work a substantial economic hardship in such defined area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(p) In the case of any sign, display, or device required to be removed under this section prior to the date of enactment of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1974, which sign, display, or device was after its removal lawfully relocated and which as a result of the amendments made to this section by such Act is required to be removed, the United States shall pay 100 per centum of the just compensation for such removal (including all relocation costs).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(q)(1) During the implementation of State laws enacted to comply with this section, the Secretary shall encourage and assist the States to develop sign controls and programs which will assure that necessary directional information about facilities providing goods and services in the interest of the traveling public will continue to be available to motorists. To this end the Secretary shall restudy and revise as appropriate existing standards for directional signs authorized under subsections 131(c)(1) and 131(f) to develop signs which are functional and esthetically compatible with their surroundings. He shall employ the resources of other Federal departments and agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts, and employ maximum participation of private industry in the development of standards and systems of signs developed for those purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Among other things the Secretary shall encourage States to adopt programs to assure that removal of signs providing necessary directional information, which also were providing directional information on June 1, 1972, about facilities in the interest of the traveling public, be deferred until all other nonconforming signs are removed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that the establishment and use and maintenance of junkyards in areas adjacent to the Interstate System and the primary system should be controlled in order to protect the public investment in such highways, to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel, and to preserve natural beauty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Federal-aid highway funds apportioned on or after January 1, 1968, to any State which the Secretary determines has not made provision for effective control of the establishment and maintenance along the Interstate System and the primary system of outdoor junkyards which are within one thousand feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main traveled way of the system, shall be reduced by amounts equal to 10 per centum of the amounts which would otherwise be apportioned to such State under section 104 of this title, until such time as such State shall provide for such effective control. Any amount which is withheld from apportionment to any State hereunder shall be reapportioned to the other States. Whenever he determines it to be in the public interest, the Secretary may suspend, for such periods as he deems necessary, the application of this subsection to a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Effective control means that by January 1, 1968, such junkyards shall be screened by natu<!-- PDFPage:102 -->ral objects, plantings, fences, or other appropriate means so as not to be visible from the main traveled way of the system, or shall be removed from sight.</p>

Such designation shall be made only upon the written agreement of the State or States involved that such highway will be constructed to meet all the standards of a highway on the Interstate System within twelve years of the date of the agreement between the Secretary and the State or States involved. The mileage of any highway designated as a future part of the Interstate System under this subsection shall not be charged against the limitations established by the first sentence of section 103(e) of this title. The designation of a highway as part of the Interstate System under this subsection shall create no Federal financial responsibility with respect to such highway; except that any State may use funds available to it under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(5)(B) of this title for the resurfacing, restoring, rehabilitating, and reconstructing of any highway designated as a route on the Interstate System under this subsection before the date of enactment of this sentence. In the event that the State or States involved have not substantially completed the construction of any highway designated under this subsection within the time provided for in the agreement between the Secretary and State or States involved, the Secretary shall remove the designation of such highway as a future part of the Interstate System. Removal of such designation as result of failure to comply with the agreement provided for in this subsection shall in no way prohibit the Secretary from designating such route as part of the Interstate System pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or under any other provision of law providing for addition to the Interstate System. No law, rule, regulation, <!-- PDFPage:105 -->map, document, or other record of the United States, or of any State or political subdivision thereof, shall refer to any highway under this section, nor shall any such highway be signed or marked, as a highway on the Interstate System until such time as such highway is constructed to the geometric and construction standards for the Interstate System and has been designated as a part of the Interstate System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary shall designate those portions of highway segments on the Federal-aid primary system in States which have no Interstate System that are logical components to a system serving the State's principal cities, national defense needs and military installations, and traffic generated by rail, water, and air transportation modes. The designated segments shall have been constructed to the geometric and construction standards adequate for current and probable future traffic demands and the needs of the locality of the segment. The mileage of any highway designated as part of the Interstate System under this subsection shall not be charged against the limitation established by the first sentence of section 103(e)(1) of this title. The designation of a highway under this subsection shall create no Federal financial responsibility with respect to such highway, except that the State involved may use Federal-aid highway funds available to it under sections 104(b)(1) and 104(b)(5)(B) of this title, for the resurfacing, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction of a highway designated as a route on the Interstate System under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(g) The provision of assistance under subsection (a)(2) shall not be construed as bringing within the application of chapter 15 of title 5, United States Code, any non-supervisory employee of an urban mass transportation system (or of any other agency or entity performing related functions) to whom such chapter is otherwise inapplicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Funds available for expenditure to carry out the purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be supplementary to and not in substitution for funds authorized and available for obligation pursuant to chapter 53 of title 49.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In order to promote the desirable development of the Nation's natural resources, to revitalize and diversify the economy of rural areas and smaller communities, to enhance and disperse industrial growth, to encourage more balanced population patterns, to check, and, where possible, to reverse current migratory trends from rural areas and smaller communities, and to improve living conditions and the quality of the environment, the Secretary is authorized to make grants to States for projects for the construction, reconstruction, and improvement of development highways on a Federal-aid system (other than the Interstate System) to serve and promote the development of economic growth centers and surrounding areas, encourage the location of business and industry in rural areas, facilitate the mobility of labor in sparsely populated areas, and provide rural citizens with improved highways to such public and private services as health care, recreation, employment, education, and cultural activities, or otherwise <!-- PDFPage:111 -->encourage the social and economic development of rural communities, and for planning, surveys, and investigations in connection therewith.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each Governor may transmit to the Secretary his recommendations for (1) the selection of economic growth centers within the State, (2) priorities for the construction of development highways on a Federal-aid system (other than the Interstate System) to serve such centers, and (3) such other information as may be required by the Secretary, for his consideration in approving the selection of economic growth centers for projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Upon the application of the State highway department of any State in which an economic growth center approved by the Secretary as eligible for a project is located, the Secretary is authorized to pay up to 100 per centum of the cost of engineering and economic surveys or other investigations necessary for the planning and design of development highways on a Federal-aid system (other than the Interstate System) needed to provide appropriate access to such growth center, including publicly owned airport facilities and public ports for water transportation which may be established to serve it, in order to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, all of the provisions of this title applicable to highways on the Federal-aid system on which such development highway is located except those which the Secretary determines are inconsistent with this section shall apply to development highways and to funds authorized to carry out this section. For the purposes of sections 105, 106, and 118 of this title, funds authorized to carry out this section shall be deemed to be apportioned on January 1 next preceding the commencement of the fiscal year for which authorized. No State shall receive in any fiscal year more than 15 per centum of the funds authorized to carry out this section for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Federal share of the cost of any project for construction, reconstruction, or improvement of a development highway under this section shall be the same as that provided under this title for any other project on the Federal-aid system on which such development highway is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Except in the case of a project subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, no project shall be approved by the Secretary under this section until he has determined that such project will promote the aims and purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section and that the economic growth center to be benefited will meet such criteria as he, after consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, deems necessary, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) growth centers shall be geographically and economically capable of contributing significantly to the development of the area, and (2) growth centers shall have a population not in excess of one hundred thousand according to the latest available Federal census. In approving projects the Secretary shall give preference to those areas offering the most potential for future economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a project proposed to be conducted within the Appalachian region as defined in section 403 of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965, no project shall be approved by the Secretary under this section until he shall have consulted with the Federal Cochairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission. In the case of a project proposed to be conducted within an economic development region as defined in title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, no project shall be approved by the Secretary under this section until he shall have consulted with the Federal Cochairman for such region and the Secretary of Commerce. In consultation with the appropriate official, the Secretary shall establish criteria for the selection of growth centers eligible for assistance under this section such that the aims and purposes set forth in subsection (a) of this section will be promoted. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (1) growth centers shall be geographically and economically capable of contributing significantly to the development of the area, (2) growth centers shall have a population not in excess of one hundred thousand persons according to the latest available Federal census, and (3) the selection of such growth centers within the Appalachian region and the economic development regions shall take into account the purposes of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 and the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. In approving projects the Secretary shall give preference to those areas offering the most potential for future economic growth and he shall make arrangements for close coordination throughout the development and implementation of the project with the Federal Cochairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission, or with the appropriate Federal Cochairman of an economic development region, and the Secretary of Commerce, as the case may be.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;144. Highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Congress hereby finds and declares it to be in the vital interest of the Nation that a highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation program be established to enable the several States to replace or rehabilitate highway bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, or railroads when the States and the Secretary finds that a bridge is significantly important and is unsafe because of structural deficiencies, physical deterioration, or functional obsolescence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1) inventory all those highway bridges on any Federal-aid system which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads; (2) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use; (3) based on that classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation; and (4) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall (1) inventory all those highway bridges on public roads, other than those on any Federal-aid system, which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads, (2) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, (3) based on the classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation and (4) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may, at the request of a State, inventory bridges, on and off the Federal-aid system, for historic significance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Inventory of indian reservation and park bridges</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As part of the activities carried out under paragraph (1), the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, shall (A) inventory all those highway bridges on Indian reservation roads and park roads which are bridges over waterways, other topographical barriers, other highways, and railroads, (B) classify them according to serviceability, safety, and essentiality for public use, (C) based on the classification, assign each a priority for replacement or rehabilitation, and (D) determine the cost of replacing each such bridge with a comparable facility or of rehabilitating such bridge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever any State or States make application to the Secretary for assistance in replacing or rehabilitating a highway bridge which the priority system established under subsection (b) and (c) of this section shows to be eligible, the Secretary may approve Federal participation in replacing such bridge with a comparable facility or in rehabilitating such bridge. Whenever any State makes application to the Secretary for assistance in painting and seismic retrofit, or applying calcium magnesium acetate to, the structure of a highway bridge, the Secretary may approve Federal participation in the painting or seismic retrofit of, or application of such acetate to, such structure. The Secretary shall determine the eligibility of highway bridges for replacement or rehabilitation for each State based upon the unsafe highway bridges in such State, except that a State may carry out a project for seismic retrofit of a bridge under this section without regard to whether the bridge is eligible for replacement or rehabilitation under this section. In approving projects (other than projects for bridge structure painting or seismic retrofit or application of such acetate) under this section, the Secretary shall give consideration to those projects which will remove from service those highway bridges most in danger of failure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Funds authorized to carry out this section shall be apportioned among the several States on October 1 of the fiscal year for which authorized in accordance with this subsection. Each deficient bridge shall be placed into one of the following categories: (1) Federal-aid system bridges eligible for replacement, (2) Federal-aid system bridges eligible for rehabilitation, (3) off-system bridges eligible for replacement, and (4) off-system bridges eligible for rehabilitation. The square footage of deficient bridges in each category shall be multiplied by the respective unit price on a State-by-State basis, as determined by the Secretary; and the total cost in each State divided by the total cost of the deficient bridges in all States shall determine the apportionment factors. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the total cost of deficient bridges in a State and in all States shall be reduced by the total cost of any highway bridges constructed under subsection (m) in such State, relating to replacement of destroyed bridges and ferryboat services. No State shall receive more than 10 per centum or less than 0.25 per centum of the total apportionment for any one fiscal year. The Secretary shall make these determinations based upon the latest available data, which shall be updated annually. Funds apportioned under this section shall be available for expenditure for the same period as funds apportioned for projects on the Federal-aid primary system under this title. Any funds not obligated <!-- PDFPage:113 -->at the expiration of such period shall be reapportioned by the Secretary to the other States in accordance with this subsection. The use of funds authorized under this section to carry out a project for the seismic retrofit of a bridge shall not affect the apportionment of funds under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Federal share payable on account of any project under this section shall be 80 per centum of the cost thereof.</p>

Upon determining a State bridge apportionment and before transferring funds to the States, the Secretary shall transfer the Indian reservation bridge allocation under this paragraph to the Secretary of the Interior for expenditure pursuant to this paragraph. The Secretary, after consultation with State and Indian tribal government officials and with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Interior, may, with respect to such State, reduce the requirement for expenditure for bridges under this paragraph when the Secretary determines that there are inadequate needs to justify such expenditure. The non-Federal share payable on account of such a project may be provided from funds made available for Indian reservation roads under chapter 2 of this title.</p>

A lower speed limit may be established for any vehicle operating under a special permit because of any weight or dimension of such vehicle, including any load thereon. Clause (4) of this subsection shall not apply to any portion of a highway during such time that the condition of the highway, weather, an accident, or other condition creates a temporary hazard to the safety of traffic on such portion of a highway.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) As used in this section the term &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; means any vehicle driven or drawn by mechanical power manufactured primarily for use on public highways, except any vehicle operated exclusively on a rail or rails.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;204. Federal Lands Highways Program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Recognizing the need for all Federal roads which are public roads to be treated under the same uniform policies as roads which are on the Federal-aid systems, there is established a coordinated Federal lands highways program which shall consist of the public lands highways, park roads, parkways, and Indian reservation roads as defined in section 101 of this title. The Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall develop appropriate transportation planning procedures and safety, bridge, and pavement management systems for roads funded under the Federal Lands Highway Program. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, no public lands highway project may be undertaken in any State pursuant to this section unless the State concurs in the selection and planning of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Funds available for public lands highways shall be used by the Secretary to pay for the cost of planning, research, engineering and construction thereof. Funds available for park roads, parkways, and Indian reservation roads shall be used by the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior to pay for the cost of construction and improvement thereof. In connection therewith, the Secretary and the Secretary of <!-- PDFPage:136 -->the Interior, as appropriate, may enter into construction contracts and such other contracts with a State or civil subdivision thereof or Indian tribe as deemed advisable. In the case of Indian reservation roads, Indian labor may be employed in such construction and improvement under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior. No ceiling on Federal employment shall be applicable to construction or improvement of Indian reservation roads. Funds available for each class of Federal lands highways shall be available for any kind of transportation project eligible for assistance under this title that is within or adjacent to or provides access to the areas served by the particular class of Federal lands highways. The Secretary of Interior may reserve funds from the Bureau of Indian Affairs&rsquo; administrative funds associated with the Indian reservation roads program to finance the Indian technical centers authorized under section 326.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Before approving as a project on an Indian reservation road any project eligible for funds apportioned under section 104 or section 144 of this title in a State, the Secretary must determine that the obligation of funds for such project is supplementary to and not in lieu of the obligation, for projects on Indian reservation roads, of a fair and equitable share of funds apportioned to such State under section 104 of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, Indian reservation roads under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior shall be eligible to expend not more than 15 percent funds&nbsp;<sup><a href="#204_1_target" name="204_1">1</a></sup> apportioned for Indian reservation roads from the Highway Trust Fund for the purpose of road sealing projects. The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall continue to retain responsibility, including annual funding request responsibility, for road maintenance programs on Indian reservations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Cooperation of States, counties, or other local subdivisions may be accepted in construction and improvement, and any funds received from a State, county, or local subdivision shall be credited to appropriations available for the class of Federal lands highways to which such funds were contributed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Construction of each project shall be performed by contract awarded by competitive bidding, unless the Secretary or the Secretary of the Interior shall affirmatively find that, under the circumstances relating to such project, some other method is in the public interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of section 23 of the &ldquo;Buy Indian&rdquo; Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 891), and the provisions of section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (88 Stat. 2205) shall apply to all funds administered by the Secretary of the Interior which are appropriated for the construction and improvement of Indian reservation roads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) All appropriations for the construction and improvement of each class of Federal lands highways shall be administered in conformity with regulations and agreements jointly approved by the Secretary and the Secretary of the appropriate Federal land managing agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary shall transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture from appropriations for forest highways such amounts as may be needed to cover necessary administrative expenses of the Forest Service in connection with forest highways.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Eligible Projects</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Funds available for each class of Federal lands highways may be available for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Transportation planning for tourism and recreational travel including the National Forest Scenic Byways Program, Bureau of Land Management Back Country Byways Program, National Trail System Program, and other similar Federal programs that benefit recreational development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Adjacent vehicular parking areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Interpretive signage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Acquisition of necessary scenic easements and scenic or historic sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Provision for pedestrians and bicycles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Construction and reconstruction of roadside rest areas including sanitary and water facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Other appropriate public road facilities such as visitor centers as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Transfers to Secretary of the Interior</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall transfer to the Secretary of the Interior from the appropriation for public land highways amounts as may be needed to cover necessary administrative costs of the Bureau of Land Management in connection with public lands highways.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Indian Reservation Roads Planning</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Up to 2 percent of funds made available for Indian reservation roads for each fiscal year shall be allocated to those Indian tribal governments applying for transportation planning pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Indian tribal government, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, and, as may be appropriate, with a State, local government, or metropolitan planning organization, shall develop a transportation improvement program, that includes all Indian reservation road projects proposed for funding. Projects shall be selected by the Indian tribal government from the transportation improvement program and shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Whenever any project for the construction of a circumferential highway around a city or of a radial intracity route thereto submitted by any State is certified by the Secretary of Defense, or such other official as the President may designate, as being important for civilian or military defense, such project may be constructed out of the funds heretofore or hereafter authorized to be appropriated for defense access roads.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the Secretary shall determine that the State highway department of any State is unable to obtain possession and the right to enter upon and use the required rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands, improved or unimproved, required for any project authorized by this section with sufficient promptness, the Secretary is authorized to acquire, enter upon, take possession thereof, and expend funds for projects thereon, prior to approval of title by the Attorney General, in the name of the United States, such rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands as may be required in such State for such projects by purchase, donation, condemnation, or otherwise in accordance with the laws of the United States (including the Act of February 26, 1931; 46 Stat. 1421). The cost incurred by the Secretary in acquiring any such rights-of-way, lands, or interest in lands may include the cost of examination and abstract of title, certificate of title, advertising, and any fees incidental to such acquisition; and shall be payable out of the funds available for paying the cost or the Federal share of the cost of the project for which such rights-of-way, lands, or interests in lands are acquired. The Secretary is further authorized and directed by proper deed executed in the name of the United States to convey any lands or interests in lands acquired in any State under the provisions of prior Acts or of this section to the State highway department of such State or to such political subdivision thereof as its laws may provide, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State highway department, or political subdivisions to which the conveyance is to be made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The provisions of section 112 of this title are applicable to defense access roads.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:139 --><p class="statutory-body">(g) If the Secretary shall determine that it is necessary for the expeditious completion of any defense access road project he may advance to any State out of funds appropriated for defense access roads transferred and available to the Department of Transportation the Federal share of the cost of construction thereof to enable the State highway department to make prompt payments for acquisition of rights-of-way, and for the construction as it progresses. The sums so advanced shall be deposited in a special fund by the State official authorized by State law to receive such funds, to be disbursed solely upon vouchers approved by the State highway department for rights-of-way which have been or are being acquired and for construction which has been actually performed under this section. Upon determination by the Secretary that funds advanced to any State under the provisions of this subsection are no longer required, the amount of the advance which is determined to be in excess of requirements for the project shall be repaid upon his demand, and such repayments shall be returned to the credit of the appropriation from which the funds were advanced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Funds appropriated for the purposes of this section shall be available to pay the cost of repairing damage caused to highways by the operation of vehicles and equipment in the construction of classified military installations and facilities for ballistic missiles if the Secretary shall determine that the State highway department of any State is, or has been, unable to prevent such damage by restrictions upon the use of such highways without interference with, or delay in, the completion of a contract for the construction of such military reservations or installations. This subsection shall apply notwithstanding any provision of contract holding a party thereto responsible for such damage, if the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall determine, in fact, that construction estimates and the bid of such party did not include allowance for repairing such damage. This subsection shall apply to damage caused by construction work commenced prior to June 1, 1961, and still in progress on that date and construction work which is commenced or for which a contract is awarded on or after June 1, 1961.</p>

Not to exceed one-third of the appropriation authorized for each fiscal year may be expended without requiring the country or countries in which such funds may be expended to match any part thereof, if the Secretary of State shall find that the cost of constructing said highway in such country or countries will be beyond their reasonable capacity to bear. The remainder of such authorized appropriations shall be available for expenditure only when matched to the extent required by this section by the country in which such expenditure may be made. Expenditures from the funds available on a matching basis shall not be made for the survey and construction of any portion of said highway within the borders of any country named herein unless such country shall provide and make available for expenditure in conjunction therewith a sum equal to at least one-third of the expenditures that may be incurred by that Government and the United States on such portion of the highway. All expenditures by the United States under the provisions of this section for material, equipment, and supplies shall, whenever practicable, be made for products of the United States or of the country in which such survey or construction work is being carried on. Construction work to be performed under contract shall be advertised for a reasonable period by the Minister of Public Works, or other similar official, of the government concerned in each of the participating countries and contracts shall be awarded pursuant to such advertisements with the approval of the Secretary. No part of the appropriations authorized shall be available for obligation or expenditure for work on said highway in any cooperating country unless the government of said country shall have assented to the provisions of this section; shall have furnished satisfactory assurances that it has an organization adequately qualified to administer the functions required of such country under the provisions hereof; and then only as such country may submit requests, from time to time, for the construction of any portion of the highway to standards adequate to meet present and future traffic needs.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) despite an annual expenditure in excess of $10,000,000,000 on surface transportation and its infrastructure, the Federal Government has not developed a clear vision of&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the role of federally funded research and development in ensuring that appropriate transportation systems are developed and implemented;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the population of the United States is projected to increase by over 30,000,000 people within the next 20 years, mostly in existing major metropolitan areas, which will result in increased traffic congestion within and between urban areas, more accidents, loss of productive time, and increased cost of transportation unless new technologies are developed to improve public transportation within cities and to move people and goods between cities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) 18,000,000 crashes, 4,000,000 injuries, and 45,000 fatalities each year on the Nation's highways are intolerable and substantial research is required in order to develop safer technologies in their most useful and economic forms;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) current research and development funding for surface transportation is insufficient to provide the United States with the technologies essential to providing its own advanced transportation systems in the future and, as a result, the United States is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign surface transportation technologies and equipment to meet its expanding surface transportation needs;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the inability of government agencies to cooperate effectively, the difficulty of obtaining public support for new systems and rights-of-way, and the high cost of capital financing discourage private firms from investing in the development of new transportation equipment and systems; therefore, the Federal Government should sponsor and coordinate research and development of new technologies to provide safer, more convenient, and affordable transportation systems for use in the future; and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each executive department, independent establishment, office, board, bureau, commission, authority, administration, corporation wholly owned or controlled by the United States, or other agency of the Government of the United States, hereinafter collectively and individually referred to as &ldquo;agency&rdquo;, which on or after July 29, 1946, has jurisdiction over and custody of any dam constructed or to be constructed and owned by or for the United States, is authorized, with any funds available to it, to design and construct any such dam in such manner that it will constitute and serve as a suitable and adequate foundation to support a public highway bridge upon and across such dam, and to design and construct upon the foundation thus provided a public highway bridge upon and across such dam. The highway department of the State in which such dam shall be located, jointly with the Secretary, shall first determine and certify to such agency that such bridge is economically desirable and needed as a link in the State or Federal-aid highway systems, and shall request such agency to design and construct such dam so that it will serve as a suitable and adequate foundation for a public highway bridge and to design and construct such public highway bridge upon and across such dam, and shall agree to reimburse such agency pursuant to subsection (d) of this section for any additional costs which it may be required to incur because of the design and construction of such dam so that it will serve as a foundation for a public highway bridge and for expenditures which it may find it necessary to make in designing and constructing such public highway bridge upon and across such dam. In no case shall the design and construction of a bridge upon and across such dam be undertaken hereunder except by the agency having jurisdiction over and custody of the dam, acting directly or through contractors employed by it, and after such agency shall determine that it will be structurally feasible and will not interfere with the proper functioning and operation of the dam.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Construction of any bridge upon and across any dam pursuant to this section shall not be commenced unless and until the State in which such bridge is to be located, or the appropriate subdivision of such State, shall enter into an agreement with such agency and with the Secretary to construct, or cause to be constructed, with or without the aid of Federal funds, the approach roads necessary to connect such bridge with existing public highways and to maintain, or cause to be maintained, such approach roads from and after their completion. Such agreement may also provide for the design and construction of such bridge upon and across the dam by such agency of the United States and for reimbursing such agency the costs incurred by it in the design and construction of the bridge as provided in subsection (d) of this section. Any such agency is hereby authorized to convey to the State, or to the appropriate subdivision thereof, without costs, such easements and rights-of-way in its custody or over lands of the United States in its custody and control as may be necessary, convenient, or proper for the location, construction, and maintenance of the approach roads referred to in this section including such roadside parks or recreational areas of <!-- PDFPage:162 -->limited size as may be deemed necessary for the accommodation of the traveling public. Any bridge constructed pursuant to this section upon and across a dam in the custody and jurisdiction of any agency of the United States, including such portion thereof, if any, as may extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall constitute and remain a part of said dam and be maintained by the agency. Any such agency may enter into any such contracts and agreements with the State or its subdivisions respecting public use of any bridge so located and constructed as may be deemed appropriate, but no such bridge shall be closed to public use by the agency except in cases of emergency or when deemed necessary in the interest of national security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) All costs and expenses incurred and expenditures made by any agency in the exercise of the powers and authority conferred by this section (but not including any costs, expenses, or expenditures which would have been required in any event to satisfy a legal road or bridge relocation obligation or to meet operating or other agency needs) shall be recorded and kept separate and apart from the other costs, expenses, and expenditures of such agency, and no portion thereof shall be charged or allocated to flood control, navigation, irrigation, fertilizer production, the national defense, the development of power, or other program, purpose, or function of such agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Not to exceed $65,000,000 of any money heretofore or hereafter appropriated for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this title or prior Acts shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of this section, as an emergency fund, to reimburse any agency for any additional costs or expenditures which it may be required to incur because of the design and construction of any such dam so that it will constitute and serve as a foundation for a public highway bridge upon and across such dam and to reimburse any such agency for any costs, expenses, or expenditures which it may be required to make in designing and constructing any such bridge upon and across a dam in accordance with the provisions of this section, except such costs, expenses, or expenditures as would have been required of such agency in any event to satisfy a legal obligation to relocate a highway or bridge or to meet operating or other agency needs, and there is authorized to be appropriated any sum or sums necessary to reimburse the funds so expended by the Secretary from time to time under the authority of this section. Of each bridge constructed upon and across a dam under the provisions of this section, there may be financed wholly with Federal funds that portion thereof which is located within the physical limits of the masonry structure, or structures, of the dam, and the Secretary shall in his sole discretion determine what additional portion of the bridge, if any, may be so financed, such determination to be final and conclusive. The remainder of the bridge, and any necessary related approach roads, shall be financed by the State or its appropriate subdivision with or without the aid of Federal funds; but said portion of the bridge so financed by the State or its subdivisions, including such portion thereof, if any, as may extend beyond the physical limits of the dam, shall nevertheless be designed and constructed solely by the agency having custody and jurisdiction of the dam as provided in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In making, reviewing, or approving the design of any bridge or approach structure to be constructed under this section, the agency shall, in matters relating to roadway design, loadings, clearances and widths, and traffic safeguards, give full consideration to and be guided by the standards and advice of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The authority conferred by this section shall be in addition to and not in limitation of authority conferred upon any agency by any other law, and nothing in this section contained shall affect or be deemed to relate to any bridge approach structure, or highway constructed or to be constructed by any such agency in furtherance of its lawful purposes and requirements or to satisfy a legal obligation incurred independently of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each State shall have a highway safety program approved by the Secretary, designed to reduce traffic accidents and deaths, injuries, and property damage resulting therefrom. Such programs shall be in accordance with uniform guidelines promulgated by the Secretary. Such uniform guidelines shall be expressed in terms of performance criteria. In addition, such uniform guidelines shall include programs (1) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicles being driven in excess of posted speed limits, (2) to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices (including the use of safety belts and child restraint systems) by occupants of motor vehicles and to increase public awareness of the benefit of motor vehicles equipped with airbags, (3) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired by alcohol or a controlled substance, (4) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from accidents involving motor vehicles and motorcycles, (5) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from accidents involving school buses, and (6) to improve law enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic supervision, and post-accident procedures. If the Secretary does not designate as priority programs those programs described in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing the reasons for not prioritizing such programs. The Secretary shall establish a highway safety program for the collection and reporting of data on traffic-related deaths and injuries by the States. Under such program, the States shall collect and report such data as the Secretary may require. The purposes of the program are to ensure national uniform data on such deaths and injuries and to allow the Secretary to make determinations for use in developing programs to reduce such deaths and injuries and making recommendations to Congress concerning legislation necessary to implement such programs. The program shall include information obtained by the Secretary under section 4007 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 and provide for annual reports to the Secretary on the efforts being made by the States in reducing deaths and injuries occurring at highway construction sites and the effectiveness and results of such efforts. The Secretary shall establish minimum reporting criteria for the program. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to, criteria on deaths and injuries resulting from police pursuits, school bus accidents, and speeding, on traffic-related deaths and injuries at highway construction sites and on the configuration of commercial motor vehicles involved in motor vehicle accidents. Such uniform guidelines shall be promulgated by the Secretary so as to improve driver performance (including, but not limited to, driver education, driver testing to determine proficiency to operate motor vehicles, driver examinations (both physical and mental) and driver licensing) and to improve pedestrian performance and bicycle safety. In addition such uniform guidelines shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for an effective record system of accidents (including injuries and deaths resulting therefrom), accident investigations to determine the probable causes of accidents, injuries, and deaths, vehicle registration, operation, and inspection, highway design and maintenance (including lighting, markings, and surface treatment), traffic control, vehicle codes and laws, surveillance of traffic for detection and correction of high or potentially high accident locations, and emergency services. Such guidelines as are applicable to State highway safety programs shall, to the extent determined appropriate by the Secretary, be applicable to federally administered areas where a Federal department or agency controls the highways or supervises traffic operations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) provide for programs (which may include financial incentives and disincentives) to encourage the use of safety belts by drivers of, and passengers in, motor vehicles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to waive the requirement of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in whole or in part, for a fiscal year for any State whenever he determines that there is an insufficient number of local highway safety programs to justify the expenditure in such State of such percentage of Federal funds during such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Administrative requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may not approve a State highway safety program under this section which does not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide that the Governor of the State shall be responsible for the administration of the program through a State highway safety agency which shall have adequate powers and be suitably equipped and organized to carry out, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, such program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) authorize political subdivisions of the State to carry out local highway safety programs within their jurisdictions as a part of the State highway safety program if such local highway safety programs are approved by the Governor and are in accordance with the minimum standards established by the Secretary under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) except as provided in paragraph (5), provide that at least 40 percent of all Federal funds apportioned under this section to the State for any fiscal year will be expended by the political subdivisions of the State, including Indian tribal governments, in carrying out local highway safety programs authorized in accordance with subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide adequate and reasonable access for the safe and convenient movement of individuals with disabilities, including those in wheelchairs, across curbs constructed or replaced on or after July 1, 1976, at all pedestrian crosswalks throughout the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may waive the requirement of paragraph (3)(C), in whole or in part, for a fiscal year for any State whenever the Secretary determines that there is an insufficient number of local highway safety programs to justify the expenditure in the State of such percentage of Federal funds during the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Use of technology for traffic enforcement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may encourage States to use technologically advanced traffic enforcement devices (including the use of automatic speed detection devices such as photo-radar) by law enforcement officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section shall be used to aid the States to conduct the highway safety programs approved in accordance with subsection (a), including development and implementation of manpower training programs, and of demonstration programs that the Secretary determines will contribute directly to the reduction of accidents, and deaths and injuries resulting therefrom. Such funds shall be subject to a deduction not to exceed 5 per centum for the necessary costs of administering the provisions of this section, and the remainder shall be apportioned among the several States. Such funds shall be apportioned 75 per centum in the ratio which the population of each State bears to the total population of all the States, as shown by the latest available Federal census, and 25 per centum in the ratio which the public road mileage in each State bears to the total public road mileage in all States. For the purposes of this subsection, a &ldquo;public road&rdquo; means any road under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public authority and open to public travel. Public road mileage as used in this subsection shall be determined as of the end of the calendar year preceding the year in which the funds are apportioned and shall be certified to by the Governor of the State and subject to approval by the Secretary. The annual apportionment to each State shall not be less than one-half of 1 per centum of the total apportionment, except that the apportionments to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall not be less than one-quarter of 1 per centum of the total apportionment. The Secretary shall not apportion any funds under the subsection to any State which is not implementing a highway safety program approved by the secretary in accordance with this section. For the purpose of the seventh sentence of this subsection, a highway safety program approved by the Secretary shall not include any requirement that a State implement such a program by adopting or enforcing any law, rule, or regulation based on a guideline promulgated by the Secretary under this section requiring any motorcycle operator eighteen years of age or older or passenger eighteen years of age or older to wear a safety helmet when operating or riding a motorcycle on the streets and highways of that State. Implementation of a highway safety program under this section shall not be construed to require the Secretary to require compliance with every uniform guideline, or with every element of every uniform guideline, in every State. Funds apportioned under this section to any State, that does not have a highway safety program approved by the Secretary or that is not implementing an approved program, shall be reduced by amounts equal to not less than 50 per centum of the amounts that would otherwise be apportioned to the State under this section, until such time as the Secretary approves such program or determines that the State is implementing an approved program, as appropriate. The Secretary shall consider the gravity of the State's failure to have or implement an approved program in determining the amount of the reduction. The Secretary shall promptly apportion to the State the funds withheld from its apportionment if he approves the State's highway safety program or determines that the State has begun implementing an approved program, as appropriate, prior to the end of the fiscal year for which the funds were withheld. If the Secretary determines that <!-- PDFPage:171 -->the State did not correct its failure within such period, the Secretary shall reapportion the withheld funds to the other States in accordance with the formula specified in this subsection not later than 30 days after such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) All provisions of chapter 1 of this title that are applicable to National Highway System highway funds other than provisions relating to the apportionment formula and provisions limiting the expenditure of such funds to the Federal-aid systems, shall apply to the highway safety funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section, except as determined by the Secretary to be inconsistent with this section, and except that the aggregate of all expenditures made during any fiscal year by a State and its political subdivisions (exclusive of Federal funds) for carrying out the State highway safety program (other than planning and administration) shall be available for the purpose of crediting such State during such fiscal year for the non-Federal share of the cost of any project under this section (other than one for planning or administration) without regard to whether such expenditures were actually made in connection with such project and except that, in the case of a local highway safety program carried out by an Indian tribe, if the Secretary is satisfied that an Indian tribe does not have sufficient funds available to meet the non-Federal share of the cost of such program, he may increase the Federal share of the cost thereof payable under this Act to the extent necessary. In applying such provisions of chapter 1 in carrying out this section the term &ldquo;State highway department&rdquo; as used in such provisions shall mean the Governor of a State for the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Uniform guidelines promulgated by the Secretary to carry out this section shall be developed in cooperation with the States, their political subdivisions, appropriate Federal departments and agencies, and such other public and private organizations as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary may make arrangements with other Federal departments and agencies for assistance in the preparation of uniform guidelines for the highway safety programs contemplated by subsection (a) and in the administration of such programs. Such departments and agencies are directed to cooperate in such preparation and administration, on a reimbursable basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Nothing in this section authorizes the appropriation or expenditure of funds for (1) highway construction, maintenance, or design (other than design of safety features of highways to be incorporated into guidelines) or (2) any purpose for which funds are authorized by section 403 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(h) Repealed. Pub. L. 97&ndash;35, title XI, &sect;1107(c), Aug. 13, 1981, 95 Stat. 626.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) For the purpose of the application of this section on Indian reservations, &ldquo;State&rdquo; and &ldquo;Governor of a State&rdquo; includes the Secretary of the Interior and &ldquo;political subdivision of a State&rdquo; includes an Indian tribe: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (C) of subsection (b)(1) hereof, 95 per centum of the funds apportioned to the Secretary of the Interior after date of enactment, shall be expended by Indian tribes to carry out highway safety programs within their jurisdictions: <em>And provided further</em>, That the provisions of subparagraph (E) of subsection (b)(1) hereof shall be applicable except in those tribal jurisdictions in which the Secretary determines such programs would not be practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Rulemaking Process</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall, not later than September 1, 1987, begin a rulemaking process to determine those programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and deaths. Not later than April 1, 1988, the Secretary shall promulgate a final rule establishing those programs determined to be most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and deaths. If such rule is promulgated by April 1, 1988, then it shall take effect October 1, 1988. If such rule is not promulgated by April 1, 1988, it shall take effect October 1, 1989. After a rule is promulgated in accordance with this subsection, the Secretary may from time to time thereafter revise such rule under a rulemaking process described in the first sentence of this subsection. Any rule under this subsection shall be promulgated taking into account consideration of the States having a major role in establishing programs described in the first sentence of this subsection. When a rule promulgated in accordance with this subsection takes effect, only those programs established by such rule as most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and deaths shall be eligible to receive Federal financial assistance under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Subject to the provisions of this subsection, the Secretary shall make a grant to any State which includes, as part of its highway safety program under section 402 of this title, the use of a comprehensive computerized safety recordkeeping system designed to correlate data regarding traffic accidents, drivers, motor vehicles, and roadways. Any such grant may only be used by such State to establish and maintain a comprehensive computerized traffic safety recordkeeping system or to obtain and operate components to support highway safety priority programs identified by the Secretary under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a report, list, schedule, or survey is prepared by or for a State or political subdivision thereof under this subsection, such report, list, schedule, or survey shall not be admitted as evidence or used in any suit or action for damages arising out of any matter mentioned in such report, list, schedule, or survey.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No State may receive a grant under this subsection in more than two fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the grant to any State under this subsection for the first fiscal year such State is eligible for a grant under this subsection shall equal 10 per centum of the amount apportioned to such State for fiscal year 1985 under this section.
