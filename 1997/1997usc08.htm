Asylum rules have been reformed to end abuse by those falsely claiming asylum, while offering protection to those in genuine fear of persecution. We are cracking down on smugglers of illegal aliens and reforming criminal alien deportation for quicker removal. And we are the first Administration to obtain funding to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">While we already are doing more to stem the flow of illegal immigration than has any previous Administration, more remains to be done. In conjunction with the Administration's unprecedented budget proposal to support immigration initiatives, this directive provides a blueprint of policies and priorities for this Administration's continuing work to curtail illegal immigration. With its focus on strong border deterrence backed up by effective worksite enforcement, removal of criminal and other deportable aliens and assistance to states, this program protects the security of our borders, our jobs and our communities for all Americans&mdash;citizens and legal immigrants alike.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">COMPREHENSIVE BORDER CONTROL STRATEGY</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">A. <em>Deterring Illegal Immigration At Our Borders</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">I have directed the Attorney General to move expeditiously toward full implementation of our comprehensive border control strategy, including efforts at the southwest border. To support sustained long-term strengthening of our deterrence capacity, the Administration shall seek funding to add new Border Patrol agents to reach the goal of at least 7,000 agents protecting our borders by the year 2000.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Flexible Border Response Capacity</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">To further this strategy, the Department of Justice shall implement the capacity to respond to emerging situations anywhere along our national borders to deter buildups of illegal border crossers, smuggling operations, or other developing problems.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Strategic Use of High Technology</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Through the strategic use of sensors, night scopes, helicopters, light planes, all-terrain vehicles, fingerprinting and automated recordkeeping, we have freed many Border Patrol agents from long hours of bureaucratic tasks and increased the effectiveness of these highly-trained personnel. Because these tools are essential for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to do its job, I direct the Attorney General to accelerate to the greatest extent possible their utilization and enhancement to support implementation of our deterrence strategy.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Strong Enforcement Against Repeat Illegal Crossers</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Justice shall assess the effectiveness of efforts underway to deter repeat illegal crossers, such as fingerprinting and dedicating prosecution resources to enforce the new prosecution authority provided by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, see Tables for classification].</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Justice shall determine whether accelerated expansion of these techniques to additional border sectors is warranted.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">B. <em>Deterring Alien Smuggling</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">This Administration has had success deterring large ship-based smuggling directly to United States shores. In response, smugglers are testing new routes and tactics. Our goal: similar success in choking off these attempts by adjusting our anti-smuggling initiatives to anticipate shifting smuggling patterns.</p>
<p class="note-body">To meet new and continuing challenges posed along transport routes and in foreign locations by smuggling organizations, we will augment diplomatic and enforcement resources at overseas locations to work with host governments, and increase related intelligence gathering efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Departments of State and Justice, in cooperation with other relevant agencies, will report to the National Security Council within 30 days on the structure of interagency coordination to achieve these objectives.</p>
<p class="note-body">Congressional action will be important to provide U.S. law enforcement agencies with needed authority to deal with international smuggling operations. I will propose that the Congress pass legislation providing wiretap authority for investigation of alien smuggling cases and providing authorization to seize the assets of groups engaged in trafficking in human cargo.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, I will propose legislation to give the Attorney General authority to implement procedures for expedited exclusion to deal with large flows of undocumented migrants, smuggling operations, and other extraordinary migration situations.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">C. <em>Visa Overstay Deterrence</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">Nearly half of this country's illegal immigrants come into the country legally and then stay after they are required by law to depart, often using fraudulent documentation. No Administration has ever made a serious effort to identify and deport these individuals. This Administration is committed to curtailing this form of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, relevant departments and agencies are directed to review their policies and practices to identify necessary reforms to curtail visa overstayers and to enhance investigations and prosecution of those who fraudulently produce or misuse passports, visas, and other travel related documents. Recommendations for administrative initiatives and legislative reform shall be presented to the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration by June 30, 1995.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">REDUCING THE MAGNET OF WORK OPPORTUNITIES, WORKSITE ENFORCEMENT, AND DETERRENCE</h4>
<p class="note-body">Border deterrence cannot succeed if the lure of jobs in the United States remains. Therefore, a second major component of the Administration's deterrence strategy is to toughen worksite enforcement and employer sanctions. Employers who hire illegal immigrants not only obtain unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding employers, their unlawful use of illegal immigrants suppresses wages and working conditions for our country's legal workers. Our strategy, which targets enforcement efforts at employers and industries that historically have relied upon employment of illegal immigrants, will not only strengthen deterrence of illegal immigration, but better protect American workers and businesses that do not hire illegal immigrants.</p>
<p class="note-body">Central to this effort is an effective, nondiscriminatory means of verifying the employment authorization of all new employees. The Administration fully supports the recommendation of the Commission on Legal Immigration Reform to create pilot projects to test various techniques for improving workplace verification, including a computer database test to validate a new worker's social security number for work authorization purposes. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Social Security Administration are directed to establish, implement, monitor, and review the pilots and provide me with an interim report on the progress of this program by March 1, 1996.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, the INS is directed to finalize the Administration's reduction of the number of authorized documents to support work verification for noncitizens. Concurrently, the Administration will seek further reduction legislatively in the number of documents that are acceptable for proving identity and work authorization. The Administration will improve the security of existing documents to be used for work authorization and seek increased penalties for immigration fraud, including fraudulent production and use of documents.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Labor shall intensify its investigations in industries with patterns of labor law violations that promote illegal immigration.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:51 --><p class="note-body">I also direct the Department of Labor, INS, and other relevant Federal agencies to expand their collaboration in cracking down on those who subvert fair competition by hiring illegal aliens. This may include increased Federal authority to confiscate assets that are the fruits of that unfair competition.</p>
<p class="note-body">The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall further examine the link between immigration and employment, including illegal immigration, and recommend to me other appropriate measures.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">DETENTION AND REMOVAL OF DEPORTABLE ILLEGAL ALIENS</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Administration's deterrence strategy includes strengthening the country's detention and deportation capability. No longer will criminals and other high risk deportable aliens be released back into communities because of a shortage of detention space and ineffective deportation procedures.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">A. <em>Comprehensive Deportation Process Reform</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Justice, in consultation with other relevant agencies, shall develop a streamlined, fair, and effective procedure to expedite removal of deportable aliens. As necessary, additional legislative authority will be sought in this area. In addition, the Department of Justice shall increase its capacity to staff deportation and exclusion hearings to support these objectives.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">B. <em>National Detention and Removal Plan</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">To address the shortage of local detention space for illegal aliens, the Administration shall devise a National Detention, Transportation, and Removal Policy that will permit use of detention space across the United States and improve the ability to remove individuals with orders of deportation. The Department of Justice, in consultation with other agencies as appropriate and working under the auspices of the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration, shall finalize this plan by April 30, 1995.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Administration will seek support and funding from the Congress for this plan and for our efforts to double the removal of illegal aliens with final orders of deportation.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">C. <em>Identification and Removal of Criminal Aliens</em></h4>
<p class="note-body">The Institutional Hearing Program is successfully expediting deportation of incarcerated criminal aliens after they serve their sentences.</p>
<p class="note-body">To further expedite removal of criminal aliens from this country and reduce costs to Federal and State governments, the Department of Justice is directed to develop an expanded program of verification of the immigration status of criminal aliens within our country's prisons. In developing this program, the viability of expanding the work of the Law Enforcement Support Center should be assessed and all necessary steps taken to increase coordination and cooperative efforts with State, and local law enforcement officers in identification of criminal aliens.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">TARGETED DETERRENCE AREAS</h4>
<p class="note-body">Many of the Administration's illegal immigration enforcement initiatives are mutually reinforcing. For example, strong interior enforcement supports border control. While there have been efforts over the years at piecemeal cooperation, this Administration will examine, develop, and test a more comprehensive coordinated package of deterrence strategies in selected metropolitan areas by multiple Federal, State, and local agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration shall coordinate the development of this interagency and intergovernmental operation.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS</h4>
<p class="note-body">The law denies most government benefits to illegal aliens. The government has a duty to assure that taxpayer-supported public assistance programs are not abused. As with work authorization, enforcement of eligibility requirements relies upon a credible system of verification. The INS, working with the White House Interagency Working Group on Immigration as appropriate, shall review means of improving the existing benefits verification program. In addition, we will seek new mechanisms&mdash;including increased penalties for false information used to qualify for benefits&mdash;to protect the integrity of public programs.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">ANTI-DISCRIMINATION</h4>
<p class="note-body">Our efforts to combat illegal immigration must not violate the privacy and civil rights of legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Therefore, I direct the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and other relevant Administration officials to vigorously protect our citizens and legal immigrants from immigration-related instances of discrimination and harassment. All illegal immigration enforcement measures shall be taken with due regard for the basic human rights of individuals and in accordance with our obligations under applicable international agreements.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">ASSISTANCE TO STATES</h4>
<p class="note-body">States today face significant costs for services provided to illegal immigrants as a result of failed policies of the past. Deterring illegal immigration is the best long-term solution to protect States from growing costs for illegal immigration. This is the first Administration to address this primary responsibility squarely. We are targeting most of our Federal dollars to those initiatives that address the root causes that lead to increased burdens on States.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government provides States with billions of dollars to provide for health care, education, and other services and benefits for immigrants. This Administration is proposing increases for immigration and immigration-related spending of 25 percent in 1996 compared to 1993 levels. In addition, this Administration is the first to obtain funding from the Congress to reimburse States for a share of the costs of incarcerated illegal aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">This Administration will continue to work with States to obtain more Federal help for certain State costs and will oppose inappropriate cost-shifting to the States.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION</h4>
<p class="note-body">This Administration will continue to emphasize international cooperative efforts to address illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pursuant to a Presidential Review Directive (PRD), the Department of State is now coordinating a study on United States policy toward international refugee and migration affairs. I hereby direct that, as part of that PRD process, this report to the National Security Council include the relationship of economic development and migration in the Western Hemisphere and, in particular, provide recommendations for further foreign economic policy measures to address causes of illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of State shall coordinate an interagency effort to consider expanded arrangements with foreign governments for return of criminal and deportable aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of State also shall seek to negotiate readmission agreements for persons who could have sought asylum in the last country from which they arrived. Such agreements will take due regard of U.S. obligations under the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of State further shall implement cooperative efforts with other nations receiving smuggled aliens or those used as transhipment points by smugglers. In particular, we will look to countries in our hemisphere to join us by denying their territory as bases for smuggling operations.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:52 --><p class="note-body">The Department of State shall initiate negotiations with foreign countries to secure authority for the United States Coast Guard to board source country vessels suspected of transporting smuggled aliens.</p>
<p class="note-body">This directive shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maximum number of admissions; increases for humanitarian concerns; allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in fiscal year 1980, 1981, or 1982, may not exceed fifty thousand unless the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation (as defined in subsection (e) of this section), that admission of a specific number of refugees in excess of such number is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the number of refugees who may be admitted under this section in any fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 shall be such number as the President determines, before the beginning of the fiscal year and after appropriate consultation, is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Admissions under this subsection shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after appropriate consultation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the determination made under this subsection for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1992), the President shall enumerate, with the respective number of refugees so determined, the number of aliens who were granted asylum in the previous year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For any fiscal year, not more than a total of 1,000 refugees may be admitted under this subsection or granted asylum under section 1158 of this title pursuant to a determination under the third sentence of section 1101(a)(42) of this title (relating to persecution for resistance to coercive population control methods).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determinations by President respecting number of admissions for humanitarian concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the President determines, after appropriate consultation, that (1) an unforeseen emergency refugee situation exists, (2) the admission of certain refugees in response to the emergency refugee situation is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest, and (3) the admission to the United States of these refugees cannot be accomplished under subsection (a) of this section, the President may fix a number of refugees to be admitted to the United States during the succeeding period (not <!-- PDFPage:83 -->to exceed twelve months) in response to the emergency refugee situation and such admissions shall be allocated among refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with a determination made by the President after the appropriate consultation provided under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Admission by Attorney General of refugees; criteria; admission status of spouse or child; applicability of other statutory requirements; termination of refugee status of alien, spouse or child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the numerical limitations established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Attorney General may, in the Attorney General's discretion and pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, admit any refugee who is not firmly resettled in any foreign country, is determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the United States, and is admissible (except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A spouse or child (as defined in section 1101(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) of any refugee who qualifies for admission under paragraph (1) shall, if not otherwise entitled to admission under paragraph (1) and if not a person described in the second sentence of section 1101(a)(42) of this title, be entitled to the same admission status as such refugee if accompanying, or following to join, such refugee and if the spouse or child is admissible (except as otherwise provided under paragraph (3)) as an immigrant under this chapter. Upon the spouse's or child's admission to the United States, such admission shall be charged against the numerical limitation established in accordance with the appropriate subsection under which the refugee's admission is charged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of paragraphs (4), (5), and (7)(A) of section 1182(a) of this title shall not be applicable to any alien seeking admission to the United States under this subsection, and the Attorney General may waive any other provision of such section (other than paragraph (2)(C) or subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (E) of paragraph (3)) with respect to such an alien for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. Any such waiver by the Attorney General shall be in writing and shall be granted only on an individual basis following an investigation. The Attorney General shall provide for the annual reporting to Congress of the number of waivers granted under this paragraph in the previous fiscal year and a summary of the reasons for granting such waivers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The refugee status of any alien (and of the spouse or child of the alien) may be terminated by the Attorney General pursuant to such regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe if the Attorney General determines that the alien was not in fact a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42) of this title at the time of the alien's admission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Oversight reporting and consultation requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before the start of each fiscal year the President shall report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate regarding the foreseeable number of refugees who will be in need of resettlement during the fiscal year and the anticipated allocation of refugee admissions during the fiscal year. The President shall provide for periodic discussions between designated representatives of the President and members of such committees regarding changes in the worldwide refugee situation, the progress of refugee admissions, and the possible need for adjustments in the allocation of admissions among refugees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as possible after representatives of the President initiate appropriate consultation with respect to the number of refugee admissions under subsection (a) of this section or with respect to the admission of refugees in response to an emergency refugee situation under subsection (b) of this section, the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall cause to have printed in the Congressional Record the substance of such consultation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination under subsection (a) of this section, a hearing to review the proposed determination shall be held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After the President initiates appropriate consultation prior to making a determination, under subsection (b) of this section, that the number of refugee admissions should be increased because of an unforeseen emergency refugee situation, to the extent that time and the nature of the emergency refugee situation permit, a hearing to review the proposal to increase refugee admissions shall be held unless public disclosure of the details of the proposal would jeopardize the lives or safety of individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Appropriate consultation&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;appropriate consultation&rdquo; means, with respect to the admission of refugees and allocation of refugee admissions, discussions in person by designated Cabinet-level representatives of the President with members of the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and of the House of Representatives to review the refugee situation or emergency refugee situation, to project the extent of possible participation of the United States therein, to discuss the reasons for believing that the proposed admission of refugees is justified by humanitarian concerns or grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest, and to provide such members with the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A description of the nature of the refugee situation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A description of the number and allocation of the refugees to be admitted and an analysis of conditions within the countries from which they came.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A description of the proposed plans for their movement and resettlement and the estimated cost of their movement and resettlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) An analysis of the anticipated social, economic, and demographic impact of their admission to the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:84 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A description of the extent to which other countries will admit and assist in the resettlement of such refugees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) An analysis of the impact of the participation of the United States in the resettlement of such refugees on the foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Such additional information as may be appropriate or requested by such members.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent possible, information described in this subsection shall be provided at least two weeks in advance of discussions in person by designated representatives of the President with such members.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must apply for such adjustment during the 18-month period beginning on the first day of the seventh month that begins after November 6, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Performance of seasonal agricultural services and residence in the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) resided in the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days,</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Admissible as immigrant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien must establish that he is admissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as otherwise provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to permanent residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall adjust the status of any alien provided lawful temporary resident status under paragraph (1) to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence on the following date:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Group 1</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the numerical limitation established under subparagraph (C), in the case of an alien who has established, at the time of application for temporary residence under paragraph (1), that the alien performed seasonal agricultural services in the United States for at least 90 man-days during each of the 12-month periods ending on May 1, 1984, 1985, and 1986, the adjustment shall occur on the first day after the end of the one-year period that begins on the later of (I) the date the alien was granted such temporary resident status, or (II) the day after the last day of the application period described in paragraph (1)(A).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) During the period of temporary resident status granted an alien under paragraph (1), the Attorney General may terminate such status only upon a determination under this chapter that the alien is deportable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Before any alien becomes eligible for adjustment of status under paragraph (2), the Attorney General may deny adjustment to permanent status and provide for termination of the temporary resident status granted such alien under paragraph (1) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Attorney General finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the adjustment to temporary resident status was the result of fraud or willful misrepresentation as set out in section 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the alien commits an act that (I) makes the alien inadmissible to the United States as an immigrant, except as provided under subsection (c)(2) of this section, or (II) is convicted of a felony or 3 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Authorized travel and employment during temporary residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the period an alien is in lawful temporary resident status granted under this subsection, the alien has the right to travel abroad (including commutation from a residence abroad) and shall be granted authorization to engage in employment in the United States and shall be provided an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit, in the same manner as for aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:91 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an alien who acquires the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under paragraph (1), such status not having changed, is considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (as described in section 1101(a)(20) of this title), other than under any provision of the immigration laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications for adjustment of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) To whom may be made</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Within the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide that applications for adjustment of status under subsection (a) may be filed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with the Attorney General, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with a designated entity (designated under paragraph (2)), but only if the applicant consents to the forwarding of the application to the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Outside the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of State, shall provide a procedure whereby an alien may apply for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section at an appropriate consular office outside the United States. If the alien otherwise qualifies for such adjustment, the Attorney General shall provide such documentation of authorization to enter the United States and to have the alien's status adjusted upon entry as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Designation of entities to receive applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of receiving applications under this section, the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall designate qualified voluntary organizations and other qualified State, local, community, farm labor organizations, and associations of agricultural employers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may designate such other persons as the Attorney General determines are qualified and have substantial experience, demonstrated competence, and traditional long-term involvement in the preparation and submittal of applications for adjustment of status under section 1159 or 1255 of this title, Public Law 89&ndash;732 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note], or Public Law 95&ndash;145 [8 U.S.C. 1255 note].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Proof of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An alien may establish that he meets the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section through government employment records, records supplied by employers or collective bargaining organizations, and such other reliable documentation as the alien may provide. The Attorney General shall establish special procedures to credit properly work in cases in which an alien was employed under an assumed name.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Documentation of work history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) An alien applying for adjustment of status under subsection (a)(1) of this section has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien has worked the requisite number of man-days (as required under subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an employer or farm labor contractor employing such an alien has kept proper and adequate records respecting such employment, the alien's burden of proof under clause (i) may be met by securing timely production of those records under regulations to be promulgated by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) An alien can meet such burden of proof if the alien establishes that the alien has in fact performed the work described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section by producing sufficient evidence to show the extent of that employment as a matter of just and reasonable inference. In such a case, the burden then shifts to the Attorney General to disprove the alien's evidence with a showing which negates the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the evidence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of applications by designated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each designated entity must agree to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it in accordance with paragraph (1)(A)(ii) but not to forward to the Attorney General applications filed with it unless the applicant has consented to such forwarding. No such entity may make a determination required by this section to be made by the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Files and records prepared for purposes of this section by designated entities operating under this section are confidential and the Attorney General and the Service shall not have access to such files or records relating to an alien without the consent of the alien, except as allowed by a court order issued pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Confidentiality of information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in this paragraph, neither the Attorney General, nor any other official or employee of the Department of Justice, or bureau or agency thereof, may&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) make any publication whereby the information furnished by any particular individual can be identified; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) permit anyone other than the sworn officers and employees of the Department or bureau or agency or, with respect to applications filed with a designated entity, that designated entity, to examine individual applications.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Required disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall provide information furnished under this section, and any <!-- PDFPage:92 -->other information derived from such furnished information, to a duly recognized law enforcement entity in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution, when such information is requested in writing by such entity, or to an official coroner for purposes of affirmatively identifying a deceased individual (whether or not such individual is deceased as a result of a crime).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Construction</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has passed an appropriate examination (recognized in regulations promulgated in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services) or has a full and unrestricted license under State law to practice professional nursing in the State of intended employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements which authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to engage in the practice of professional nursing as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to the United States and is authorized under such laws to be employed by the facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The employment of the alien will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of registered nurses similarly employed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The alien employed by the facility will be paid the wage rate for registered nurses similarly employed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Either (I) the facility has taken and is taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and retain sufficient registered nurses who are United States citizens or immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services, in order to remove as quickly as reasonably possible the dependence of the facility on nonimmigrant registered nurses, or (II) the facility is subject to an approved State plan for the recruitment and retention of nurses (described in paragraph (3)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment of such an alien is not intended or designed to influence an election for a bargaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A facility is considered not to meet clause (i) (relating to an attestation of a substantial disruption in delivery of health care services) if the facility, within the previous year, laid off registered nurses. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a facility that lays off a registered nurse other than a staff nurse still meets clause (i) if, in its attestation under this subparagraph, the facility has attested that it will not replace the nurse with a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title (either through promotion or otherwise) for a period of 1 year after the date of the lay off. Nothing in clause (iv) shall be construed as requiring a facility to have taken significant steps described in such clause before Dec. 18, 1989. In the case of an alien for whom an employer has filed an attestation under this subparagraph and who is performing services at a worksite other than the employer's or other than a worksite controlled by the employer, the Secretary may waive such requirements for the attestation for the worksite as may be appropriate in order to avoid duplicative attestations, in cases of temporary, emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv)(I), each of the following shall be considered a significant step reasonably designed to recruit and retain registered nurses:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Providing career development programs and other methods of facilitating health care workers to become registered nurses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Paying registered nurses wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to registered nurses similarly employed in the geographic area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Providing adequate support services to free registered nurses from administrative and other nonnursing duties.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The steps described in this subparagraph shall not be considered to be an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to meet the conditions of subparagraph (A)(iv)(I). Nothing herein shall require a facility to take more than one step, if the facility can demonstrate that taking a second step is not reasonable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subject to subparagraph (E), an attestation under subparagraph (A) shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a facility's failure to meet conditions attested to or a facility's misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the Secretary). The Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this clause if there is reasonable cause to believe that a facility fails to meet conditions attested to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date such a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in clause (iv). If the Secretary determines that such a basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a facility (for which an attestation is made) has failed to meet a condition attested to or that there was a misrepresentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt of such notice, the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with respect to a facility during a period of at least 1 year for nurses to be employed by the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) In addition to the sanctions provided under clause (iv), if the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that a facility has violated the condition attested to under subparagraph (A)(iii) (relating to payment of registered nurses at the prevailing wage rate), the Secretary shall order the facility to provide for payment of such amounts of back pay as may be required to comply with such condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Labor shall provide for a process under which a State may submit to the Secretary a plan for the recruitment and retention of United States citizens and immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services as registered nurses in facilities in the State. Such a plan may include counseling and educating health workers and other individuals concerning the employment opportunities available to registered nurses. The Secretary shall provide, on an annual basis in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for the approval or disapproval of such a plan, for purposes of paragraph (2)(A)(iv)(II). Such a plan may not be considered to be approved with respect to the facility unless the plan provides for the taking of significant steps described in paragraph (2)(A)(iv)(I) with respect to registered nurses in the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The period of admission of an alien under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of this title shall be for an initial period of not to exceed 3 years, subject to an extension for a period or periods, not to exceed a total period of admission of 5 years (or a total period of admission of 6 years in the case of extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Attorney General).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe, including when he deems necessary the giving of a bond with sufficient surety in such sum and containing such conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe, to insure that at the expiration of such time or upon failure to maintain the status under which he was admitted, or to maintain any status subsequently acquired under section 1258 of this title, such alien will depart from the United States. No alien admitted to Guam without a visa pursuant to section 1182(<em>l</em>) of this title may be authorized to enter or stay in the United States other than in Guam or to remain in Guam for a period exceeding fifteen days from date of admission to Guam. No alien <!-- PDFPage:129 -->admitted to the United States without a visa pursuant to section 1187 of this title may be authorized to remain in the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor for a period exceeding 90 days from the date of admission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(O) of this title shall be for such period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the event (or events) for which the nonimmigrant is admitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The period of authorized status as a nonimmigrant described in section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title shall be for such period as the Attorney General may specify in order to provide for the competition, event, or performance for which the nonimmigrant is admitted. In the case of nonimmigrants admitted as individual athletes under section 1101(a)(15)(P) of this title, the period of authorized status may be for an initial period (not to exceed 5 years) during which the nonimmigrant will perform as an athlete and such period may be extended by the Attorney General for an additional period of up to 5 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Presumption of status; written waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every alien (other than a nonimmigrant described in subparagraph (H)(i) or (L) of section 1101(a)(15) of this title) shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for a visa, and the immigration officers, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15) of this title. An alien who is an officer or employee of any foreign government or of any international organization entitled to enjoy privileges, exemptions, and immunities under the International Organizations Immunities Act [22 U.S.C. 288 et seq.], or an alien who is the attendant, servant, employee, or member of the immediate family of any such alien shall not be entitled to apply for or receive an immigrant visa, or to enter the United States as an immigrant unless he executes a written waiver in the same form and substance as is prescribed by section 1257(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petition of importing employer; involvement of Departments of Labor and Agriculture</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H), (L), (O), or (P)(i) of this title in any specific case or specific cases shall be determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, upon petition of the importing employer. Such petition, shall be made and approved before the visa is granted. The petition shall be in such form and contain such information as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The approval of such a petition shall not, of itself, be construed as establishing that the alien is a nonimmigrant. For purposes of this subsection with respect to nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, the term &ldquo;appropriate agencies of Government&rdquo; means the Department of Labor and includes the Department of Agriculture. The provisions of section 1188 of this title shall apply to the question of importing any alien as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Attorney General shall provide for a procedure under which an importing employer which meets requirements established by the Attorney General may file a blanket petition to import aliens as nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title instead of filing individual petitions under paragraph (1) to import such aliens. Such procedure shall permit the expedited processing of visas for admission of aliens covered under such a petition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(L) of this title, an alien is considered to be serving in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to a company if the alien has a special knowledge of the company product and its application in international markets or has an advanced level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the company.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions for approval of H&ndash;2A petitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A petition to import an alien as an H&ndash;2A worker (as defined in subsection (i)(2) of this section) may not be approved by the Attorney General unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary of Labor for a certification that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the petition, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor may require by regulation, as a condition of issuing the certification, the payment of a fee to recover the reasonable costs of processing applications for certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for denial of labor certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Labor may not issue a certification under subsection (a) of this section with respect to an employer if the conditions described in that subsection are not met or if any of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute which, under the regulations, precludes such certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The employer during the previous two-year period employed H&ndash;2A workers and the Secretary of Labor has determined, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the employer at any time during that period substantially violated a material term or condition of the labor certification with respect to the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) No employer may be denied certification under subparagraph (A) for more than three years for any violation described in such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The employer has not provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that if the <!-- PDFPage:148 -->employment for which the certification is sought is not covered by State workers&rsquo; compensation law, the employer will provide, at no cost to the worker, insurance covering injury and disease arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment which will provide benefits at least equal to those provided under the State workers&rsquo; compensation law for comparable employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Secretary determines that the employer has not made positive recruitment efforts within a multi-state region of traditional or expected labor supply where the Secretary finds that there are a significant number of qualified United States workers who, if recruited, would be willing to make themselves available for work at the time and place needed. Positive recruitment under this paragraph is in addition to, and shall be conducted within the same time period as, the circulation through the interstate employment service system of the employer's job offer. The obligation to engage in positive recruitment under this paragraph shall terminate on the date the H&ndash;2A workers depart for the employer's place of employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rules for consideration of applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following rules shall apply in the case of the filing and consideration of an application for a labor certification under this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deadline for filing applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Labor may not require that the application be filed more than 60 days before the first date the employer requires the labor or services of the H&ndash;2A worker.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice within seven days of deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The employer shall be notified in writing within seven days of the date of filing if the application does not meet the standards (other than that described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section) for approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the application does not meet such standards, the notice shall include the reasons therefor and the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the prompt resubmission of a modified application.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Issuance of certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary of Labor shall make, not later than 20 days before the date such labor or services are first required to be performed, the certification described in subsection (a)(1) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the employer has complied with the criteria for certification (including criteria for the recruitment of eligible individuals as prescribed by the Secretary), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employer does not actually have, or has not been provided with referrals of, qualified eligible individuals who have indicated their availability to perform such labor or services on the terms and conditions of a job offer which meets the requirements of the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In considering the question of whether a specific qualification is appropriate in a job offer, the Secretary shall apply the normal and accepted qualifications required by non-H&ndash;2A-employers in the same or comparable occupations and crops.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) For a period of 3 years subsequent to the effective date of this section, labor certifications shall remain effective only if, from the time the foreign worker departs for the employer's place of employment, the employer will provide employment to any qualified United States worker who applies to the employer until 50 percent of the period of the work contract, under which the foreign worker who is in the job was hired, has elapsed. In addition, the employer will offer to provide benefits, wages and working conditions required pursuant to this section and regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The requirement of clause (i) shall not apply to any employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) did not, during any calendar quarter during the preceding calendar year, use more than 500 man-days of agricultural labor, as defined in section 203(u) of title 29,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is not a member of an association which has petitioned for certification under this section for its members, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) has not otherwise associated with other employers who are petitioning for temporary foreign workers under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Six months before the end of the 3-year period described in clause (i), the Secretary of Labor shall consider the findings of the report mandated by section 403(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 as well as other relevant materials, including evidence of benefits to United States workers and costs to employers, addressing the advisability of continuing a policy which requires an employer, as a condition for certification under this section, to continue to accept qualified, eligible United States workers for employment after the date the H&ndash;2A workers depart for work with the employer. The Secretary's review of such findings and materials shall lead to the issuance of findings in furtherance of the Congressional policy that aliens not be admitted under this section unless there are not sufficient workers in the United States who are able, willing, and qualified to perform the labor or service needed and that the employment of the aliens in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. In the absence of the enactment of Federal legislation prior to three months before the end of the 3-year period described in clause (i) which addresses the subject matter of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall immediately publish the findings required by this clause, and shall promulgate, on an interim or final basis, regulations based on his findings which shall be effective no later than three years from the effective date of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) In complying with clause (i) of this subparagraph, an association shall be allowed to refer or transfer workers among its members: <em>Provided</em>, That for purposes of this section an association acting as an agent for its members shall not be considered a joint employer merely because of such referral or transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) United States workers referred or transferred pursuant to clause (iv) of this subparagraph shall not be treated disparately.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:149 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) An employer shall not be liable for payments under section 655.202(b)(6) of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation) with respect to an H&ndash;2A worker who is displaced due to compliance with the requirement of this subparagraph, if the Secretary of Labor certifies that the H&ndash;2A worker was displaced because of the employer's compliance with clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii)(I) No person or entity shall willfully and knowingly withhold domestic workers prior to the arrival of H&ndash;2A workers in order to force the hiring of domestic workers under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) Upon the receipt of a complaint by an employer that a violation of subclause (I) has occurred the Secretary shall immediately investigate. He shall within 36 hours of the receipt of the complaint issue findings concerning the alleged violation. Where the Secretary finds that a violation has occurred, he shall immediately suspend the application of clause (i) of this subparagraph with respect to that certification for that date of need.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Employers shall furnish housing in accordance with regulations. The employer shall be permitted at the employer's option to provide housing meeting applicable Federal standards for temporary labor camps or to secure housing which meets the local standards for rental and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar class of habitation: <em>Provided</em>, That in the absence of applicable local standards, State standards for rental and/or public accommodations or other substantially similar class of habitation shall be met: <em>Provided further</em>, That in the absence of applicable local or State standards, Federal temporary labor camp standards shall apply: <em>Provided further</em>, That the Secretary of Labor shall issue regulations which address the specific requirements of housing for employees principally engaged in the range production of livestock: <em>Provided further</em>, That when it is the prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended employment to provide family housing, family housing shall be provided to workers with families who request it: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing in this paragraph shall require an employer to provide or secure housing for workers who are not entitled to it under the temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June 1, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Roles of agricultural associations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker, and an application for a labor certification with respect to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural producers which use agricultural services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of associations acting as employers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an association is a joint or sole employer of temporary agricultural workers, the certifications granted under this section to the association may be used for the certified job opportunities of any of its producer members and such workers may be transferred among its producer members to perform agricultural services of a temporary or seasonal nature for which the certifications were granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of violations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Member's violation does not necessarily disqualify association or other members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual producer member of a joint employer association is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the member, the denial shall apply only to that member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the association or other member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Association's violation does not necessarily disqualify members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) If an association representing agricultural producers as a joint employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, the denial shall apply only to the association and does not apply to any individual producer member of the association unless the Secretary determines that the member participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of, the violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) If an association of agricultural producers certified as a sole employer is determined to have committed an act that under subsection (b)(2) of this section results in the denial of certification with respect to the association, no individual producer member of such association may be the beneficiary of the services of temporary alien agricultural workers admitted under this section in the commodity and occupation in which such aliens were employed by the association which was denied certification during the period such denial is in force, unless such producer member employs such aliens in the commodity and occupation in question directly or through an association which is a joint employer of such workers with the producer member.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expedited administrative appeals of certain determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations shall provide for an expedited procedure for the review of a denial of certification under subsection (a)(1) of this section or a revocation of such a certification or, at the applicant's request, for a de novo administrative hearing respecting the denial or revocation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after the time a new determination is requested, make a new determination on the request for certification in the case of an H&ndash;2A worker if able, willing, and qualified eligible individuals are not actually available at the time such labor or services are required and a certification was denied in whole or in part because of the availability of qualified workers. If the employer asserts that any eligible individual who has been referred is not able, willing, or qualified, the burden of proof is on <!-- PDFPage:150 -->the employer to establish that the individual referred is not able, willing, or qualified because of employment-related reasons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Violators disqualified for 5 years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An alien may not be admitted to the United States as a temporary agricultural worker if the alien was admitted to the United States as such a worker within the previous five-year period and the alien during that period violated a term or condition of such previous admission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, $10,000,000 for the purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of recruiting domestic workers for temporary labor and services which might otherwise be performed by nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) of monitoring terms and conditions under which such nonimmigrants (and domestic workers employed by the same employers) are employed in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to take such actions, including imposing appropriate penalties and seeking appropriate injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations, as may be necessary to assure employer compliance with terms and conditions of employment under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) There are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year, beginning with fiscal year 1987, such sums as may be necessary for the purpose of enabling the Secretary of Labor to make determinations and certifications under this section and under section 1182(a)(5)(A)(i) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Immigrants; nonimmigrants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the conditions hereinafter prescribed and subject to the limitations prescribed in this <!-- PDFPage:153 -->chapter or regulations issued thereunder, a consular officer may issue (1) to an immigrant who has made proper application therefor, an immigrant visa which shall consist of the application provided for in section 1202 of this title, visaed by such consular officer, and shall specify the foreign state, if any, to which the immigrant is charged, the immigrant's particular status under such foreign state, the preference, immediate relative, or special immigrant classification to which the alien is charged, the date on which the validity of the visa shall expire, and such additional information as may be required; and (2) to a nonimmigrant who has made proper application therefor, a nonimmigrant visa, which shall specify the classification under section 1101(a)(15) of this title of the nonimmigrant, the period during which the nonimmigrant visa shall be valid, and such additional information as may be required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Registration; photographs; waiver of requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each alien who applies for a visa shall be registered in connection with his application, and shall furnish copies of his photograph signed by him for such use as may be by regulations required. The requirements of this subsection may be waived in the discretion of the Secretary of State in the case of any alien who is within that class of nonimmigrants enumerated in sections 1101(a)(15)(A), and 1101(a)(15)(G) of this title, or in the case of any alien who is granted a diplomatic visa on a diplomatic passport or on the equivalent thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period of validity; requirement of visa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An immigrant visa shall be valid for such period, not exceeding six months, as shall be by regulations prescribed, except that any visa issued to a child lawfully adopted by a United States citizen and spouse while such citizen is serving abroad in the United States Armed Forces, or is employed abroad by the United States Government, or is temporarily abroad on business, shall be valid until such time, for a period not to exceed three years, as the adoptive citizen parent returns to the United States in due course of his service, employment, or business. A nonimmigrant visa shall be valid for such periods as shall be by regulations prescribed. In prescribing the period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa in the case of nationals of any foreign country who are eligible for such visas, the Secretary of State shall, insofar as practicable, accord to such nationals the same treatment upon a reciprocal basis as such foreign country accords to nationals of the United States who are within a similar class; except that in the case of aliens who are nationals of a foreign country and who either are granted refugee status and firmly resettled in another foreign country or are granted permanent residence and residing in another foreign country, the Secretary of State may prescribe the period of validity of such a visa based upon the treatment granted by that other foreign country to alien refugees and permanent residents, respectively, in the United States. An immigrant visa may be replaced under the original number during the fiscal year in which the original visa was issued for an immigrant who establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he was unable to use the original immigrant visa during the period of its validity because of reasons beyond his control and for which he was not responsible: <em>Provided</em>, That the immigrant is found by the consular officer to be eligible for an immigrant visa and the immigrant pays again the statutory fees for an application and an immigrant visa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Physical examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the issuance of an immigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer shall require such alien to submit to a physical and mental examination in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed. Prior to the issuance of a nonimmigrant visa to any alien, the consular officer may require such alien to submit to a physical or mental examination, or both, if in his opinion such examination is necessary to ascertain whether such alien is eligible to receive a visa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Surrender of visa</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each immigrant shall surrender his immigrant visa to the immigration officer at the port of entry, who shall endorse on the visa the date and the port of arrival, the identity of the vessel or other means of transportation by which the immigrant arrived, and such other endorsements as may be by regulations required.</p>

In the application the alien shall state his full and true name, and any other name which he has used or by which he has been known; age and sex; the date and place of his birth; and such additional information necessary to the identification of the applicant and the enforcement of the immigration and nationality laws as may be by regulations prescribed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the arrival of any person by water or by air at any port within the United States from any place outside the United States, it shall be the duty of the master or commanding officer, or authorized agent, owner, or consignee of the vessel or aircraft, having any such person on board to deliver to the immigration officers at the port of arrival typewritten or printed lists or manifests of the persons on board such vessel or aircraft. Such lists or manifests shall be prepared at such time, be in such form and shall contain such information as the Attorney General shall prescribe by regulation as being necessary for the identification of the persons transported and for the enforcement of the immigration laws. This subsection shall not require the master or commanding officer, or authorized agent, owner, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft to furnish a list or manifest relating (1) to an alien crewman or (2) to any other person arriving by air on a trip originating in foreign contiguous territory, except (with respect to such arrivals by air) as may be required by regulations issued pursuant to section 1224 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the master or commanding officer or authorized agent of every vessel or aircraft taking passengers on board at any port of the United States, who are destined to any place outside the United States, to file with the immigration officers before departure from such port a list of all such persons taken on board. Such list shall be in such form, contain such information, and be accompanied by such documents, as the Attorney General shall prescribe by regulation as necessary for the identification of the persons so transported and for the enforcement of the immigration laws. No master or commanding officer of any such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance papers for his vessel or aircraft until he or the authorized agent has deposited such list or lists and accompanying documents with the immigration officer at such port and made oath that they are full and complete as to the information required to be contained therein, except that in the case of vessels or aircraft which the Attorney General determines are making regular trips to ports of the United States, the Attorney General may, when expedient, arrange for the delivery of lists of outgoing persons at a later date. This subsection shall not require the master or commanding officer, or authorized agent, owner, or consignee of a vessel or aircraft to furnish a list or manifest relating (1) to an alien crewman or (2) to any other person departing by air on a trip originating in the United States who is destined to foreign contiguous territory, except (with respect to such departure by air) as may be required by regulations issued pursuant to section 1224 of this title.</p>

No vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending determination of the question of the liability to the payment of such penalty, or while it remains unpaid, and no such penalty shall be remitted or refunded, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit with the Commissioner of a bond or undertaking approved by the Attorney General or a sum sufficient to cover such penalty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of requirements</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Detention of aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of determining whether aliens (including alien crewmen) arriving at ports of the United States belong to any of the classes inadmissible under this chapter, by reason of being afflicted with any of the diseases or mental or physical defects or disabilities set forth in section 1182(a) of this title, or whenever the Attorney General has received information showing that any aliens are coming from a country or have embarked at a place where any of such diseases are prevalent or epidemic, such aliens shall be detained by the Attorney General for a sufficient time to enable the immigration officers and medical officers to subject such aliens to observation and an examination sufficient to determine whether or not they belong to inadmissible classes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Physical and mental examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The physical and mental examination of arriving aliens (including alien crewmen) shall be made by medical officers of the United States Public Health Service, who shall conduct all medical examinations and shall certify, for the information of the immigration officers and the immigration judges, any physical and mental defect or disease observed by such medical officers in any such alien. If medical officers of the United States Public Health Service are not available, civil surgeons of not less than four years&rsquo; professional experience may be employed for such service upon such terms as may be prescribed by the Attorney General. Aliens (including alien crewmen) arriving at ports of the United States shall be examined by at least one such medical officer or civil surgeon under such administrative regulations as the Attorney General may prescribe, and under medical regulations prepared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Medical officers of the United States Public Health Service who have had special training in the diagnosis of insanity and mental defects shall be detailed for duty or employed at such ports of entry as the Attorney General may designate, and such medical officers shall be provided with suitable facilities for the detention and examination of all arriving aliens who it is suspected may be inadmissible under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, and the services of interpreters shall be provided for such examination. Any alien certified under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, may appeal to a board of medical officers of the United States Public Health Service, which shall be convened by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and any such alien may introduce before such board one expert medical witness at his own cost and expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification of certain helpless aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an examining medical officer determines that an alien arriving in the United States is inadmissible, is helpless from sickness, mental or physical disability, or infancy, and is accompanied by another alien whose protection or guardianship may be required, the officer may certify such fact for purposes of applying section 1182(a)(10)(B) of this title with respect to the other alien.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General is authorized (1) by regulation to designate as ports of entry for aliens <!-- PDFPage:163 -->arriving by aircraft any of the ports of entry for civil aircraft designated as such in accordance with law; (2) by regulation to provide such reasonable requirements for aircraft in civil air navigation with respect to giving notice of intention to land in advance of landing, or notice of landing, as shall be deemed necessary for purposes of administration and enforcement of this chapter; and (3) by regulation to provide for the application to civil air navigation of the provisions of this chapter where not expressly so provided in this chapter to such extent and upon such conditions as he deems necessary. Any person who violates any regulation made under this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $2,000 which may be remitted or mitigated by the Attorney General in accordance with such proceedings as the Attorney General shall by regulation prescribe. In case the violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft, and such aircraft may be libeled therefore in the appropriate United States court. The determination by the Attorney General and remission or mitigation of the civil penalty shall be final. In case the violation is by the owner or person in command of the aircraft, the penalty shall be a lien upon the aircraft and may be collected by proceedings in rem which shall conform as nearly as may be to civil suits in admiralty. The Supreme Court of the United States, and under its direction other courts of the United States, are authorized to prescribe rules regulating such proceedings against aircraft in any particular not otherwise provided by law. Any aircraft made subject to a lien by this section may be summarily seized by, and placed in the custody of such persons as the Attorney General may by regulation prescribe. The aircraft may be released from such custody upon deposit of such amount not exceeding $2,000 as the Attorney General may prescribe, or of a bond in such sum and with such sureties as the Attorney General may prescribe, conditioned upon the payment of the penalty which may be finally determined by the Attorney General.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Inspection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Aliens treated as applicants for admission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) shall be deemed for purposes of this chapter an applicant for admission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stowaways</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An arriving alien who is a stowaway is not eligible to apply for admission or to be admitted and shall be ordered removed upon inspection by an immigration officer. Upon such inspection if the alien indicates an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview under subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. A stowaway may apply for asylum only if the stowaway is found to have a credible fear of persecution under subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section. In no case may a stowaway be considered an applicant for admission or eligible for a hearing under section 1229a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inspection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All aliens (including alien crewmen) who are applicants for admission or otherwise seeking admission or readmission to or transit through the United States shall be inspected by immigration officers.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Claims for asylum</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If an immigration officer determines that an alien (other than an alien described in subparagraph (F)) who is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii) is inadmissible under section 1182(a)(6)(C) or 1182(a)(7) of this title and the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum under section 1158 of this title or a fear of persecution, the officer shall refer the alien for an interview by an asylum officer under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Application to certain other aliens</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Attorney General may apply clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph to any or all aliens described in subclause (II) as designated by the Attorney General. Such designation shall be in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the Attorney General and may be modified at any time.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Aliens described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">An alien described in this clause is an alien who is not described in subparagraph (F), who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has not affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Removal without further review if no credible fear of persecution</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subject to subclause (III), if the officer determines that an alien does not have a credible fear of persecution, the officer shall order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Record of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The officer shall prepare a written record of a determination under subclause (I). Such record shall include a summary of the material facts as stated by the applicant, such additional facts (if any) relied upon by the officer, and the officer's analysis of why, in the light of such facts, the alien has not established a credible fear of persecution. A copy of the officer's interview notes shall be attached to the written summary.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(III) Review of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Attorney General shall provide by regulation and upon the alien's request for prompt review by an immigration judge of a determination under subclause (I) that the alien does not have a credible fear of persecution. Such review shall include an opportunity for the alien to be heard and questioned by the immigration judge, either in person or by telephonic or video connection. Review shall be concluded as expeditiously as possible, to the maximum extent practicable within 24 hours, but in no case later than 7 days after the date of the determination under subclause (I).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;credible fear of persecution&rdquo; means <!-- PDFPage:165 -->that there is a significant possibility, taking into account the credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum under section 1158 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on administrative review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(iii)(III), a removal order entered in accordance with subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii)(I) is not subject to administrative appeal, except that the Attorney General shall provide by regulation for prompt review of such an order under subparagraph (A)(i) against an alien who claims under oath, or as permitted under penalty of perjury under section 1746 of title 28, after having been warned of the penalties for falsely making such claim under such conditions, to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, to have been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or to have been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limit on collateral attacks</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any action brought against an alien under section 1325(a) of this title or section 1326 of this title, the court shall not have jurisdiction to hear any claim attacking the validity of an order of removal entered under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Challenge of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The decision of the examining immigration officer, if favorable to the admission of any alien, shall be subject to challenge by any other immigration officer and such challenge shall operate to take the alien whose privilege to be admitted is so challenged, before an immigration judge for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Removal of criminal aliens</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) in general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall provide for the availability of special removal proceedings at certain Federal, State, and local correctional facilities for aliens convicted of any criminal offense covered in section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to the date of their commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title. Such proceedings shall be conducted in conformity with section 1229a of this title (except as otherwise provided in this section), and in a manner which eliminates the need for additional detention at any processing center of the Service and in a manner which assures expeditious removal following the end of the alien's incarceration for the underlying sentence. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony who is taken into custody by the Attorney General pursuant to section 1226(c) of this title, the Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent practicable, detain any such felon at a facility at which other such aliens are detained. In the selection of such facility, the Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the alien's access to counsel and right to counsel under section 1362 of this title are not impaired.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Expedited proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General shall provide for the initiation and, to the extent possible, the completion of removal proceedings, and any administrative appeals thereof, in the case of any alien convicted of an aggravated felony before the alien's release from incarceration for the underlying aggravated felony.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the Attorney General to effect the removal of any alien sentenced to actual incarceration, before release from the penitentiary or correctional institution where such alien is confined.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Attorney General shall review and evaluate removal proceedings conducted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Comptroller General shall monitor, review, and evaluate removal proceedings conducted under this section. Within 18 months after the effective date of this section, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to such Committees concerning the extent to which removal proceedings conducted under this section may adversely affect the ability of such aliens to contest removal effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Removal of aliens who are not permanent residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General may, in the case of an alien described in paragraph (2), determine the deportability of such alien under section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) of this title (relating to conviction of an aggravated felony) and issue an order of removal pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subsection or section 1229a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An alien is described in this paragraph if the alien&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time at which proceedings under this section commenced; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) had permanent resident status on a conditional basis (as described in section 1186a of this title) at the time that proceedings under this section commenced.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Attorney General may not execute any order described in paragraph (1) until 14 calendar days have passed from the date that such order was issued, unless waived by the alien, in order that the alien has an opportunity to apply for judicial review under section 1252 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Proceedings before the Attorney General under this subsection shall be in accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General shall prescribe. The Attorney General shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alien is given reasonable notice of the charges and of the opportunity described in subparagraph (C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the alien shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the government) by such counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as the alien shall choose;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a United States district court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of removal at the time of sentencing against an alien who is deportable, if such an order has been requested by the United States Attorney with the concurrence of the Commissioner and if the court chooses to exercise such jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The United States Attorney shall file with the United States district court, and serve upon the defendant and the Service, prior to commencement of the trial or entry of a guilty plea a notice of intent to request judicial removal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding section 1252b&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1228_2_target" name="1228_2">2</a></sup> of this title, the United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner, shall file at least 30 days prior to the date set for sentencing a charge containing factual allegations regarding the alienage of the defendant and identifying the crime or crimes which make the defendant deportable under section 1227(a)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If the court determines that the defendant has presented substantial evidence to establish prima facie eligibility for relief from removal under this chapter, the Commissioner shall provide the court with a recommendation and report regarding the alien's eligibility for relief. The court shall either grant or deny the relief sought.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) The alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him or her, to present evidence on his or her own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The court, for the purposes of determining whether to enter an order described in paragraph (1), shall only consider evidence that would be admissible in proceedings conducted pursuant to section 1229a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Nothing in this subsection shall limit the information a court of the United States may receive or consider for the purposes of imposing an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The court may order the alien removed if the Attorney General demonstrates that the alien is deportable under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice, appeal, and execution of judicial order of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) A judicial order of removal or denial of such order may be appealed by either party to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the district court is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), such appeal shall be considered consistent with the requirements described in section 1252 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Upon execution by the defendant of a valid waiver of the right to appeal the conviction on which the order of removal is based, the expiration of the period described in section 1252(b)(1) of this title, or the final dismissal of an appeal from such conviction, the order of removal shall become final and shall be executed at the end of the prison term in accordance with the terms of the order. If the conviction is reversed on direct appeal, the order entered pursuant to this section shall be void.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) As soon as is practicable after entry of a judicial order of removal, the Commissioner shall provide the defendant with written notice of the order of removal, which shall designate the defendant's country of choice for removal and any alternate country pursuant to section 1253(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1228_2_target" name="1228_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Denial of judicial order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Denial of a request for a judicial order of removal shall not preclude the Attorney General from initiating removal proceedings pursuant to section 1229a of this title upon the same ground of deportability or upon any other ground of deportability provided under section 1227(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Stipulated judicial order of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States Attorney, with the concurrence of the Commissioner, may, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, enter into a plea agreement which calls for the alien, who is deportable under this chapter, to waive the right to notice and a hearing under this section, and stipulate to the entry of a judicial order of removal from the United States as a condition of the plea agreement or as a condition of probation or supervised release, or both. The United States district court, in both felony and misdemeanor cases, and a United States magistrate judge in misdemeanor cases, may accept such a stipulation and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judicial order of removal pursuant to the terms of such stipulation.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and who, at the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title, was provided oral notice, either in the alien's native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1) of this section) to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259 of this title for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain medical decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a medical officer or civil surgeon or board of medical officers has certified under section 1222(b) of this title that an alien has a disease, illness, or addiction which would make the alien inadmissible under paragraph (1) of section 1182(a) of this title, the decision of the immigration judge shall be based solely upon such certification.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Burden on alien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the proceeding the alien has the burden of establishing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) if the alien is an applicant for admission, that the alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under section 1182 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is lawfully present in the United States pursuant to a prior admission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In meeting the burden of proof under subparagraph (B), the alien shall have access to the alien's visa or other entry document, if any, and any other records and documents, not considered by the Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to the alien's admission or presence in the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Detention, release, and removal of aliens ordered removed</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Removal period</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;removal period&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Beginning of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The removal period begins on the latest of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court's final order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) If the alien is detained or confined (except under an immigration process), the date the alien is released from detention or confinement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Suspension of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The removal period shall be extended beyond a period of 90 days and the alien may remain in detention during such extended period if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to the alien's departure or conspires or acts to prevent the alien's removal subject to an order of removal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Detention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the removal period, the Attorney General shall detain the alien. Under no circumstance during the removal period shall the Attorney General release an alien who has been found inadmissible under section 1182(a)(2) or 1182(a)(3)(B) of this title or deportable under section 1227(a)(2) or 1227(a)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Supervision after 90-day period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General. The regulations shall include provisions requiring the alien&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to obey reasonable written restrictions on the alien's conduct or activities that the Attorney General prescribes for the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Aliens imprisoned, arrested, or on parole, supervised release, or probation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in section 259(a) of title 42 and paragraph (2),<sup><a href="#1231_1_target" name="1231_1">1</a></sup> the Attorney General may not remove an alien who is sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released from imprisonment. Parole, supervised release, probation, or possibility of arrest or further imprisonment is not a reason to defer removal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception for removal of nonviolent offenders prior to completion of sentence of imprisonment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General is authorized to remove an alien in accordance with applicable procedures under this chapter before the alien has completed a sentence of imprisonment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of an alien in the custody of the Attorney General, if the Attorney General determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense related to smuggling or harboring of aliens or an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(B), (C), (E), (I), or (L) of this <!-- PDFPage:189 -->title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1231_2_target" name="1231_2">2</a></sup> and (II) the removal of the alien is appropriate and in the best interest of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an alien in the custody of a State (or a political subdivision of a State), if the chief State official exercising authority with respect to the incarceration of the alien determines that (I) the alien is confined pursuant to a final conviction for a nonviolent offense (other than an offense described in section 1101(a)(43)(C) or (E) of this title), (II) the removal is appropriate and in the best interest of the State, and (III) submits a written request to the Attorney General that such alien be so removed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any alien removed pursuant to this paragraph shall be notified of the penalties under the laws of the United States relating to the reentry of deported aliens, particularly the expanded penalties for aliens removed under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) No private right</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No cause or claim may be asserted under this paragraph against any official of the United States or of any State to compel the release, removal, or consideration for release or removal of any alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Reinstatement of removal orders against aliens illegally reentering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Inadmissible or criminal aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section 1182 of this title, removable under section 1227(a)(1)(C), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(4) of this title or who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Employment authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No alien ordered removed shall be eligible to receive authorization to be employed in the United States unless the Attorney General makes a specific finding that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the removal of the alien is otherwise impracticable or contrary to the public interest.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Orders against criminal aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1182(a)(2) or 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their date of commission, otherwise covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No alien shall have a right to appeal from a decision of an immigration judge which is based solely on a certification described in section 1229a(c)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements for review of orders of removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the following requirements apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Venue and forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings. The record and briefs do not have to be printed. The court of appeals shall review the proceeding on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Service</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The respondent is the Attorney General. The petition shall be served on the Attorney General and on the officer or employee of the Service in charge of the Service district in which the final order of removal under section 1229a of this title was entered.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Stay of order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Service of the petition on the officer or employee does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court's decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alien's brief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a petition for judicial review not later than 40 days after the date on which the administrative record is available, and may serve and file a reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief of the Attorney General, and the court may not extend these deadlines except upon motion for good cause shown. If an alien fails to file a brief within the time provided in this paragraph, the court shall dismiss the appeal unless a manifest injustice would result.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Scope and standard for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (5)(B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the Attorney General's discretionary judgment whether to grant relief under section 1158(a) of this title shall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment of nationality claims</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Court determination if no issue of fact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall decide the nationality claim.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transfer if issue of fact</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the petitioner claims to be a national of the United States and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner's nationality is presented, the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought in the district court under section 2201 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The petitioner may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Consolidation with review of motions to reopen or reconsider</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Challenge to validity of orders in certain criminal proceedings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the validity of an order of removal has not been judicially decided, a defendant in a criminal proceeding charged with violating <!-- PDFPage:196 -->section 1253(a) of this title may challenge the validity of the order in the criminal proceeding only by filing a separate motion before trial. The district court, without a jury, shall decide the motion before trial.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Claims of United States nationality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the defendant claims in the motion to be a national of the United States and the district court finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) no genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court shall decide the motion only on the administrative record on which the removal order is based and the administrative findings of fact are conclusive if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a genuine issue of material fact about the defendant's nationality is presented, the court shall hold a new hearing on the nationality claim and decide that claim as if an action had been brought under section 2201 of title 28.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The defendant may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consequence of invalidation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the district court rules that the removal order is invalid, the court shall dismiss the indictment for violation of section 1253(a) of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">A petition for review or for habeas corpus of an order of removal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall attach a copy of such order, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A court may review a final order of removal only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) another court has not decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Judicial review of orders under section 1225(b)(1)</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Challenges on validity of the system</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Judicial review of determinations under section 1225(b) of this title and its implementation is available in an action instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, but shall be limited to determinations of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to implement such section, is constitutional; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or <!-- PDFPage:197 -->under the authority of the Attorney General to implement such section, is not consistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where the court determines that the petitioner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is an alien who was not ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the alien is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, has been admitted as a refugee under section 1157 of this title, or has been granted asylum under section 1158 of this title, the court may order no remedy or relief other than to require that the petitioner be provided a hearing in accordance with section 1229a of this title. Any alien who is provided a hearing under section 1229a of this title pursuant to this paragraph may thereafter obtain judicial review of any resulting final order of removal pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Scope of inquiry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining whether an alien has been ordered removed under section 1225(b)(1) of this title, the court's inquiry shall be limited to whether such an order in fact was issued and whether it relates to the petitioner.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Particular cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusive jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Granting of status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an alien who is a national of a foreign state designated under subsection (b) of this section (or in the case of an alien having no nationality, is a person who last habitually resided in such designated state) and who meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Attorney General, in accordance with this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may grant the alien temporary protected status in the United States and shall not remove the alien from the United States during the period in which such status is in effect, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall authorize the alien to engage in employment in the United States and provide the alien with an &ldquo;employment authorized&rdquo; endorsement or other appropriate work permit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duration of work authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Work authorization provided under this section shall be effective throughout the period <!-- PDFPage:203 -->the alien is in temporary protected status under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Upon the granting of temporary protected status under this section, the Attorney General shall provide the alien with information concerning such status under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If, at the time of initiation of a removal proceeding against an alien, the foreign state (of which the alien is a national) is designated under subsection (b) of this section, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If, at the time of designation of a foreign state under subsection (b) of this section, an alien (who is a national of such state) is in a removal proceeding under this subchapter, the Attorney General shall promptly notify the alien of the temporary protected status that may be available under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Notices under this paragraph shall be provided in a form and language that the alien can understand.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Temporary treatment for eligible aliens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of an alien who can establish a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), but for the fact that the period of registration under subsection (c)(1)(A)(iv) of this section has not begun, until the alien has had a reasonable opportunity to register during the first 30 days of such period, the Attorney General shall provide for the benefits of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of an alien who establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for benefits under paragraph (1), until a final determination with respect to the alien's eligibility for such benefits under paragraph (1) has been made, the alien shall be provided such benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Clarification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the Attorney General to deny temporary protected status to an alien based on the alien's immigration status or to require any alien, as a condition of being granted such status, either to relinquish nonimmigrant or other status the alien may have or to execute any waiver of other rights under this chapter. The granting of temporary protected status under this section shall not be considered to be inconsistent with the granting of nonimmigrant status under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, may designate any foreign state (or any part of such foreign state) under this subsection only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Attorney General finds that there is an ongoing armed conflict within the state and, due to such conflict, requiring the return of aliens who are nationals of that state to that state (or to the part of the state) would pose a serious threat to their personal safety;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Attorney General finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there has been an earthquake, flood, drought, epidemic, or other environmental disaster in the state resulting in a substantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions in the area affected,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the foreign state is unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return to the state of aliens who are nationals of the state, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the foreign state officially has requested designation under this subparagraph; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Attorney General finds that there exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent aliens who are nationals of the state from returning to the state in safety, unless the Attorney General finds that permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the national interest of the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under this paragraph shall not become effective unless notice of the designation (including a statement of the findings under this paragraph and the effective date of the designation) is published in the Federal Register. In such notice, the Attorney General shall also state an estimate of the number of nationals of the foreign state designated who are (or within the effective period of the designation are likely to become) eligible for temporary protected status under this section and their immigration status in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective period of designation for foreign states</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take effect upon the date of publication of the designation under such paragraph, or such later date as the Attorney General may specify in the notice published under such paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall remain in effect until the effective date of the termination of the designation under paragraph (3)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this section, the initial period of designation of a foreign state (or part thereof) under paragraph (1) is the period, specified by the Attorney General, of not less than 6 months and not more than 18 months.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Periodic review, terminations, and extensions of designations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At least 60 days before end of the initial period of designation, and any extended period of designation, of a foreign state (or part thereof) under this section the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, shall review the conditions in the foreign state (or part of such foreign state) for which a designation is in effect under this subsection and shall determine whether the conditions for such designation under this subsection continue to be met.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Attorney General shall establish an administrative procedure for the review of the denial of benefits to aliens under this subsection.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aliens eligible for temporary protected status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Nationals of designated foreign states</h4>

The amount of any such fee shall not exceed $50. In the case of aliens registered pursuant to a designation under this section made after July 17, 1991, the Attorney General may impose a separate, additional fee for providing an alien with documentation of work authorization. Notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, all fees collected under this subparagraph shall be credited to the appropriation to be used in carrying out this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Treatment of brief, casual, and innocent departures and certain other absences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(i) and (3)(B), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and innocent absences from the United States, without regard to whether such absences were authorized by the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous residence in the United States by reason of a brief, casual, and innocent absence described in subparagraph (A) or due merely to a brief temporary trip abroad required by emergency or extenuating circumstances outside the control of the alien.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Construction</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period of validity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (3), such documentation shall be valid during the initial period of designation of the foreign state (or part thereof) involved and any extension of such period.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective date of terminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General terminates the designation of a foreign state (or part of such foreign state) under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, such termination shall only apply to documentation and authorization issued or renewed after the effective date of the publication of notice of the determination under that subsection (or, at the Attorney General's option, after such period after the effective date of the determination as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate in order to provide for an orderly transition).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Detention of alien</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusive remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise specifically provided, this section shall constitute the exclusive authority of the Attorney General under law to permit aliens who are or may become otherwise deportable or have been paroled into the United States to remain in the United States temporarily because of their particular nationality or region of foreign state of nationality.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The owner, agent, consignee, charterer, master, or commanding officer of any vessel or aircraft arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof who fails (1) to detain on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft to detain at a place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline, any alien crewman employed thereon until an immigration officer has completely inspected such alien crewman, including a physical examination by the medical examiner, or (2) to detain any alien crewman on board the vessel, or in the case of an aircraft at a place specified by an immigration officer at the expense of the airline, after such inspection unless a conditional permit to land temporarily has been granted such alien crewman under section 1282 of this title or unless an alien crewman has been permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5) or 1283 of this title for medical or hospital treatment, or (3) to remove such alien crewman if required to do so by an immigration officer, whether such removal requirement is imposed before or after the crewman is permitted to land temporarily under section 1182(d)(5), 1282, or 1283 of this title, shall pay to the Commissioner the sum of $3,000 for each alien crewman in respect to whom any such failure occurs. No such vessel or aircraft shall be granted clearance pending the determination of the liability to the payment of such fine, or while the fine remains unpaid, except that clearance may be granted prior to the determination of such question upon the deposit of a sum sufficient to cover such fine, or of a bond with sufficient surety to secure the payment thereof approved by the Commissioner. The Attorney General may, upon application in writing therefor, mitigate such penalty to not less than $500 for each alien crewman in respect of whom such failure occurs, upon such terms as he shall think proper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prima facie evidence against transportation line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations issued by the Attorney General, proof that an alien crewman did not appear upon the outgoing manifest of the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived in the United States from any place outside thereof, or that he was reported by the master or commanding officer of such vessel or aircraft as a deserter, shall be prima facie evidence of a failure to detain or remove such alien crewman.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Removal on other than arriving vessel or aircraft; expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Attorney General finds that removal of an alien crewman under this section on the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived is impracticable or impossible, or would cause undue hardship to such alien crewman, he may cause the alien crewman to be removed from the port of arrival or any other port on another vessel or aircraft of the same transportation line, unless the Attorney General finds this to be impracticable. All expenses incurred in connection with such removal, including expenses incurred in transferring an alien crewman from one place in the United States to another under such conditions and safeguards as the Attorney General shall impose, shall be paid by the owner or owners of the vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived in the United States. The vessel or aircraft on which the alien arrived shall not be granted clearance until such expenses have been paid or their payment guaranteed to the satisfaction of the Attorney General. An alien crewman who is transferred within the United States in accordance with this subsection shall not be regarded as having been landed in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title, the term &ldquo;normal operation and service on board a vessel&rdquo; does not include any activity that is longshore work (as defined in subsection (b) of this section), except as provided under subsection (c), (d), or (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Longshore work&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this section, except as provided in paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;longshore work&rdquo; means any activity relating to the loading or unloading of cargo, the operation of cargo-related equipment (whether or not integral to the vessel), and the handling of mooring lines on the dock when the vessel is made fast or let go, in the United States or the coastal waters thereof.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for safety and environmental protection</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is no collective bargaining agreement in effect in the local port covering at least 30 percent of the number of individuals employed in performing longshore work, and an employer of alien crewmen (or the employer's designated agent or representative) has filed with the Secretary of Labor at least 14 days before the date of performance of the activity (or later, if necessary due to an unanticipated emergency, but not later than the date of performance of the activity) an attestation setting forth facts and evidence to show that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the performance of the activity by alien crewmen is permitted under the prevailing practice of the particular port as of the date of filing of the attestation and that the use of alien crewmen for such activity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) is not during a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) is not intended or designed to influence an election of a bargaining representative for workers in the local port; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) notice of the attestation has been provided by the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer to the bargaining representative of longshore workers in the local port, or, where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the attestation has been provided to longshore workers employed at the local port.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In applying subparagraph (B) in the case of a particular activity of longshore work consisting of the use of an automated self-unloading conveyor belt or vacuum-actuated system on a vessel, the attestation shall be required to be filed only if the Secretary of Labor finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence which may be submitted by any interested party, that the performance of such particular activity is not described in clause (i) of such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (4), an attestation under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) expire at the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary of Labor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) apply to aliens arriving in the United States during such 1-year period if the owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer states in each list under section 1281 of this title that it continues to comply with the conditions in the attestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An owner, agent, consignee, master, or commanding officer may meet the requirements under this subsection with respect to more than one alien crewman in a single list.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary of Labor shall compile and make available for public examination in a timely manner in Washington, D.C., a list identifying owners, agents, consignees, masters, or commanding officers which have filed lists for nonimmigrants described in section 1101(a)(15)(D)(i) of this title with respect to whom an attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this section is made and, for each such entity, a copy of the entity's attestation under paragraph (1) or subsection (d)(1) of this section (and accompanying documentation) and each such list filed by the entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting an entity's failure to meet conditions attested to, an entity's misrepresentation of a material fact in an attestation, or, in the case described in the last <!-- PDFPage:238 -->sentence of paragraph (1), whether the performance of the particular activity is or is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives, associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the Secretary).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall promptly conduct an investigation under this subparagraph if there is reasonable cause to believe that an entity fails to meet conditions attested to, an entity has misrepresented a material fact in the attestation, or, in the case described in the last sentence of paragraph (1), the performance of the particular activity is not described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to an attestation, a complaining party may request that the activities attested to by the employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D). If such a request is made, the attesting employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to conduct an investigation with respect to a matter under the last sentence of paragraph (1), a complaining party may request that the activities of the employer cease during the hearing process described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1). If such a request is made, the employer shall be issued notice of such request and shall respond within 14 days to the notice. If the Secretary makes an initial determination that the complaining party's position is supported by a preponderance of the evidence submitted, the Secretary shall require immediately that the employer cease and desist from such activities until completion of the process described in subparagraph (D) unless the employer files with the Secretary of Labor an attestation under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Under the process established under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall provide, within 180 days after the date a complaint is filed (or later for good cause shown), for a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (E). The Secretary shall provide notice of such determination to the interested parties and an opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days of the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) If the Secretary of Labor finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an entity has failed to meet a condition attested to or has made a misrepresentation of material fact in the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each alien crewman performing unauthorized longshore work) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of individuals under 16 years of age or in a State which does not provide for issuance of an identification document (other than a driver's license) referred to in clause (i), documentation of personal identity of such other type as the Attorney General finds, by regulation, provides a reliable means of identification.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Authority to prohibit use of certain documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Attorney General finds, by regulation, that any document described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) as establishing employment authorization or identity does not reliably establish such authorization or identity or is being used fraudulently to an unacceptable degree, the Attorney General may prohibit or place conditions on its use for purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Individual attestation of employment authorization</h4>

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) <cap-smallcap>Contest</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the individual does contest the nonconfirmation, the individual shall utilize the process for secondary verification provided under section 404(c) of this division.

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) <cap-smallcap>Failure to notify</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the person or entity fails to provide notice with respect to an individual as required under clause (i), the failure is deemed to constitute a violation of section 274A(a)(1)(B) with respect to that individual and the applicable civil monetary penalty under section 274A(e)(5) shall be (notwithstanding the amounts specified in such section) no less than $500 and no more than $1,000 for each individual with respect to whom such violation occurred.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12989. Economy and Efficiency in Government Procurement Through Compliance With Certain Immigration and Naturalization Act Provisions</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12989, Feb. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 6091, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. Stability and dependability are important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose work force is less stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose work force is more stable. It remains the policy of this Administration to enforce the immigration laws to the <!-- PDFPage:263 -->fullest extent, including the detection and deportation of illegal aliens. In these circumstances, contractors cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of illegal aliens, and contractors that choose to employ unauthorized aliens inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable work force than contractors that do not employ such persons. Because of this Administration's vigorous enforcement policy, contractors that employ unauthorized alien workers are necessarily less stable and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not hire such persons. I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of not contracting with providers that knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 40 U.S.C. 486(a) and 3 U.S.C. 301, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. (a) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies should not contract with employers that have not complied with section 274A(a)(1)(A) and 274A(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A), 1324a(a)(2)) (the &ldquo;INA employment provisions&rdquo;) prohibiting the unlawful employment of aliens. All discretion under this Executive order shall be exercised consistent with this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It remains the policy of this Administration to fully and aggressively enforce the antidiscrimination provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.] to the fullest extent. Nothing in this order relieves employers from their obligation to avoid unfair immigration-related employment practices as required by the antidiscrimination provisions of section 1324(b) [274B] of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324b) and all other antidiscrimination requirements of applicable law, including the requirements of 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(6) concerning the treatment of certain documentary practices as unfair immigration-related employment practices.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. Contractor, as used in this Executive order, shall have the same meaning as defined in subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. Using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Attorney General: (a) may investigate to determine whether a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 3(a) of this order where such complaints allege noncompliance with the INA employment provisions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) shall hold such hearings as are required under 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e) to determine whether an entity covered under section 3(a) is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) Whenever the Attorney General determines that a contractor or an organizational unit thereof is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions, the Attorney General shall transmit that determination to the appropriate contracting agency and such other Federal agencies as the Attorney General may determine. Upon receipt of such determination from the Attorney General, the head of the appropriate contracting agency shall consider the contractor or an organizational unit thereof for debarment as well as for such other action as may be appropriate in accordance with the procedures and standards prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of the contracting agency may debar the contractor or an organizational unit thereof based on the determination of the Attorney General that it is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions. The Attorney General's determination shall not be reviewable in the debarment proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The scope of the debarment generally should be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Attorney General finds are not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year and may be extended for additional periods of 1 year if, using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e), the Attorney General determines that the organizational unit of the Federal contractor continues to be in violation of the INA employment provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The Administrator of General Services shall list a debarred contractor or an organizational unit thereof on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs and the contractor or an organizational unit thereof shall be ineligible to participate in any procurement or nonprocurement activities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. (a) The Attorney General shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order, except for the debarment procedures. The Attorney General may adopt such additional rules and regulations and issue such orders as may be deemed necessary and appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the Attorney General under this order. If the Attorney General proposes to issue rules, regulations, or orders that affect the contracting departments and agencies, the Attorney General shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, and such other agencies as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to the extent necessary and appropriate to implement the debarment responsibility and other related responsibilities assigned to heads of contracting departments and agencies under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. Each contracting department and agency shall cooperate with and provide such information and assistance to the Attorney General as may be required in the performance of the Attorney General's functions under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. The Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the heads of contracting departments and agencies may delegate any of their functions or duties under this order to any officer or employee of their respective agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. This order shall be implemented in a manner intended to least burden the procurement process. This order neither authorizes nor requires any additional certification provision, clause, or requirement to be included in any contract or contract solicitation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. This order is not intended, and should not be construed, to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final agency decisions in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq.</em></p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prohibition of discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to <!-- PDFPage:264 -->discriminate against any individual (other than an unauthorized alien, as defined in section 1324a(h)(3) of this title) with respect to the hiring, or recruitment or referral for a fee, of the individual for employment or the discharging of the individual from employment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) because of such individual's national origin, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a protected individual (as defined in paragraph (3)), because of such individual's citizenship status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a person or other entity that employs three or fewer employees,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a person's or entity's discrimination because of an individual's national origin if the discrimination with respect to that person or entity and that individual is covered under section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e&ndash;2], or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) discrimination because of citizenship status which is otherwise required in order to comply with law, regulation, or executive order, or required by Federal, State, or local government contract, or which the Attorney General determines to be essential for an employer to do business with an agency or department of the Federal, State, or local government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Protected individual&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;protected individual&rdquo; means an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is a citizen or national of the United States, or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Additional exception providing right to prefer equally qualified citizens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it is not an unfair immigration-related employment practice for a person or other entity to prefer to hire, recruit, or refer an individual who is a citizen or national of the United States over another individual who is an alien if the two individuals are equally qualified.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Prohibition of intimidation or retaliation</h4>

An individual so intimidated, threatened, coerced, or retaliated against shall be considered, for purposes of subsections (d) and (g) of this section, to have been discriminated against.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Treatment of certain documentary practices as employment practices</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person alleging that the person is adversely affected directly by an unfair immigration-related employment practice (or a person on that person's behalf) or an officer of the Service alleging that an unfair immigration-related employment practice has occurred or is occurring may file a charge respecting such practice or violation with the Special Counsel (appointed under subsection (c) of this section).

The Special Counsel by certified mail shall serve a notice of the charge (including the date, place, and circumstances of the alleged unfair immigration-related employment practice) on the person or entity involved within 10 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No overlap with EEOC complaints</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No charge may be filed respecting an unfair immigration-related employment practice described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section if a charge with respect to that practice based on the same set of facts has been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.], unless the charge is dismissed as being outside the scope of such title. No charge respecting an employment practice may be filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under such title if a charge with respect to such practice based on the same set of facts has been filed under this subsection, unless the charge is dismissed under this section as being outside the scope of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special Counsel</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, a Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Em<!-- PDFPage:265 -->ployment Practices (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Special Counsel&rdquo;) within the Department of Justice to serve for a term of four years.

<p class="statutory-body-block">Under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, an officer or employee of the Service may carry a firearm and may execute and serve any order, warrant, subpoena, summons, or other process issued under the authority of the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any person makes application for a visa or any other document required for entry, or makes application for admission, or otherwise attempts to enter the United States, the burden of proof shall be upon such person to establish that he is eligible to receive such visa or such document, or is not inadmissible under any provision of this chapter, and, if an alien, that he is entitled to the nonimmigrant, immigrant, special immigrant, immediate relative, or refugee status claimed, as the case may be. If such person fails to establish to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he is eligible to receive a visa or other document required for entry, no visa or other document required for entry shall be issued to such person, nor shall such person be admitted to the United States unless he establishes to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is not inadmissible under any provision of this chapter. In any removal proceeding under part IV of this subchapter against any person, the burden of proof shall be upon such person to show the time, place, and manner of his entry into the United States, but in presenting such proof he shall be entitled to the production of his visa or other entry document, if any, and of any other documents and records, not considered by the Attorney General to be confidential, pertaining to such entry in the custody of the Service. If such burden of proof is not sustained, such person shall be presumed to be in the United States in violation of law.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1375. Mail-order bride business</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:298 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a substantial &ldquo;mail-order bride&rdquo; business in the United States. With approximately 200 companies in the United States, an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 men in the United States find wives through mail-order bride catalogs each year. However, there are no official statistics available on the number of mail-order brides entering the United States each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride business earn substantial profits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Although many of these mail-order marriages work out, in many other cases, anecdotal evidence suggests that mail-order brides find themselves in abusive relationships. There is also evidence to suggest that a substantial number of mail-order marriages are fraudulent under United States law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Many mail-order brides come to the United States unaware or ignorant of United States immigration law. Mail-order brides who are battered often think that if they flee an abusive marriage, they will be deported. Often the citizen spouse threatens to have them deported if they report the abuse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that the rate of marriage fraud between foreign nationals and United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence is 8 percent. It is unclear what percentage of these marriage fraud cases originate as mail-order marriages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Information dissemination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each international matchmaking organization doing business in the United States shall disseminate to recruits, upon recruitment, such immigration and naturalization information as the Immigration and Naturalization Service deems appropriate, in the recruit's native language, including information regarding conditional permanent residence status and the battered spouse waiver under such status, permanent resident status, marriage fraud penalties, the unregulated nature of the business engaged in by such organizations, and the study required under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil penalty</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any international matchmaking organization that the Attorney General determines has violated this subsection shall be subject, in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, to a civil money penalty of not more than $20,000 for each such violation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Procedures for imposition of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any penalty under subparagraph (A) may be imposed only after notice and opportunity for an agency hearing on the record in accordance with sections 554 through 557 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, in consultation with the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization and the Director of the Violence Against Women Initiative of the Department of Justice, shall conduct a study of mail-order marriages to determine, among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of such marriages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent of marriage fraud in such marriages, including an estimate of the extent of marriage fraud arising from the services provided by international matchmaking organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which mail-order spouses utilize section 1254a(a)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1375_1_target" name="1375_1">1</a></sup> of this title (providing for suspension of deportation in certain cases involving abuse), or section 1154(a)(1)(A)(iii) of this title (providing for certain aliens who have been abused to file a classification petition on their own behalf);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent of domestic abuse in mail-order marriages; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the need for continued or expanded regulation and education to implement the objectives of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 with respect to mail-order marriages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after September 30, 1996, the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate setting forth the results of the study conducted under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) International matchmaking organization</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;international matchmaking organization&rdquo; means a corporation, partnership, business, or other legal entity, whether or not organized under the laws of the United States or any State, that does business in the United States and for profit offers to United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, dating, matrimonial, or social referral services to nonresident noncitizens, by&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Persons making extraordinary contributions to national security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Immigration determine that an applicant otherwise eligible for naturalization has made an extraordinary contribution to the national security of the United States or to the conduct of United States intelligence activities, the applicant may be naturalized without regard to the residence and physical presence requirements of this section, or to the prohibitions of section 1424 of this title, and no residence within a particular State or district of the Service in the United States shall be required: <em>Provided</em>, That the applicant has continuously resided in the United States for at least one year prior to naturalization: <em>Provided further</em>, That the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any alien described in clauses (i) through (v) of section 1158(b)(2)(A) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall designate employees of the Service to conduct examinations upon applications for naturalization. For such purposes any such employee so designated is authorized to take testimony concerning any matter touching or in any way affecting the admissibility of any applicant for naturalization, to administer oaths, including the oath of the applicant for naturalization, and to require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses, including applicant, before such employee so designated and the production of relevant books, papers, and documents, and to that end may invoke the aid of any district court of the United States; and any such court may, in the event of neglect or refusal to respond to a subpena issued by any such employee so designated or refusal to testify before such employee so designated issue an order requiring such person to appear before such employee so designated, produce relevant books, papers, and documents if demanded, and testify; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. The record of the examination authorized by this subsection shall be admissible as evidence in any hearing conducted by an immigration officer under section 1447(a) of this title.

The transfer shall not be made without the consent of the Attorney General. In the case of such a transfer, the proceedings on the application shall continue as though the application had originally been filed in the district of the Service to which the application is transferred.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public ceremony</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person who has applied for naturalization shall, in order to be and before being admitted to citizenship, take in a public ceremony before the Attorney General or a court with jurisdiction under section 1421(b) of this title an oath (1) to support the Constitution of the United States; (2) to renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which the applicant was before a subject or citizen; (3) to support and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; (4) to bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and (5)(A) to bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law, or (B) to perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law, or (C) to perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law. Any such person shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of clauses (1) to (5) of the preceding sentence, except that a person who shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is opposed to the bearing of arms in the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious training and belief shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of clauses (1) to (4) and clauses (5)(B) and (5)(C) of this subsection, and a person who shows by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he is opposed to any type of service in the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of religious training and belief shall be required to take an oath containing the substance of said clauses (1) to (4) and clause (5)(C). The term &ldquo;religious training and belief&rdquo; as used in this section shall mean an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code. In the case of the naturalization of a child under the provisions of section 1433 of this title the Attorney General may waive the taking of the oath if in the opinion of the Attorney General the child is unable to understand its meaning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hereditary titles or orders of nobility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In case the person applying for naturalization has borne any hereditary title, or has been of any of the orders of nobility in any foreign state, the applicant shall in addition to complying with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section, make under oath in the same public ceremony in which the oath of allegiance is administered, an express renunciation of such title or order of nobility, and such renunciation shall be recorded as a part of such proceedings.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:331 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Expedited judicial oath administration ceremony</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1421(b) of this title, an individual may be granted an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony or administrative naturalization by the Attorney General upon demonstrating sufficient cause. In determining whether to grant an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony, a court shall consider special circumstances (such as serious illness of the applicant or a member of the applicant's immediate family, permanent disability sufficiently incapacitating as to prevent the applicant's personal appearance at the scheduled ceremony, developmental disability or advanced age, or exigent circumstances relating to travel or employment). If an expedited judicial oath administration ceremony is impracticable, the court shall refer such individual to the Attorney General who may provide for immediate administrative naturalization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall prescribe rules and procedures to ensure that the ceremonies conducted by the Attorney General for the administration of oaths of allegiance under this section are public, conducted frequently and at regular intervals, and are in keeping with the dignity of the occasion.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Concealment of material evidence; refusal to testify</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the United States attorneys for the respective districts, upon affidavit showing good cause therefor, to institute proceedings in any district court of the United States in the judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit, for the purpose of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship and canceling the certificate of naturalization on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were illegally procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, and such revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to citizenship and such canceling of certificate of naturalization shall be effective as of the original date of the order and certificate, respectively: <em>Provided</em>, That refusal on the part of a naturalized citizen within a period of ten years following his naturalization to testify as a witness in any proceeding before a congressional committee concerning his subversive activities, in a case where such person has been convicted of contempt for such refusal, shall be held to constitute a ground for revocation of such person's naturalization under this subsection as having been procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation. If the naturalized citizen does not reside in any judicial district in the United States at the time of bringing such suit, the proceedings may be instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the United States district court in the judicial district in which such person last had his residence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice to party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The party to whom was granted the naturalization alleged to have been illegally procured or procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation shall, in any such proceedings under subsection (a) of this section, have sixty days&rsquo; personal notice, unless waived by such party, in which to make answers to the petition of the United States; and if such naturalized person be absent from the United States or from the judicial district in which such person last had his residence, such notice shall be given either by personal service upon him or by publication in the manner provided for the service of summons by publication or upon absentees by the laws of the States or the place where such suit is brought.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Membership in certain organizations; prima facie evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a person who shall have been naturalized after December 24, 1952 shall within five years next following such naturalization become a member of or affiliated with any organization, membership in or affiliation with which at the time of naturalization would have precluded such person from naturalization under the provisions of section 1424 of this title, it shall be considered prima facie evidence that such person was not attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and was not well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States at the time of naturalization, and, in the absence of countervailing evidence, it shall be sufficient in the proper proceeding to authorize the revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization as having been obtained by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, and such revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to citizenship and such canceling of certificate of naturalization shall be effective as of the original date of the order and certificate, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability to citizenship through naturalization of parent or spouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who claims United States citizenship through the naturalization of a parent or spouse in whose case there is a revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section on the ground that the order and certificate of naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation shall be deemed to have lost and to lose his citizenship and any right or privilege of citizenship which he may have, now has, or may hereafter acquire under and by virtue of such naturalization of such parent or spouse, regardless of whether such person is residing within or without the United States at the time of the revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship. Any person who claims United States citizenship through the naturalization of <!-- PDFPage:334 -->a parent or spouse in whose case there is a revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization under the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, or under the provisions of section 1440(c) of this title on any ground other than that the order and certificate of naturalization were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, shall be deemed to have lost and to lose his citizenship and any right or privilege of citizenship which would have been enjoyed by such person had there not been a revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization, unless such person is residing in the United States at the time of the revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such parent or spouse to citizenship and the cancellation of the certificate of naturalization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Citizenship unlawfully procured</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a person shall be convicted under section 1425 of title 18 of knowingly procuring naturalization in violation of law, the court in which such conviction is had shall thereupon revoke, set aside, and declare void the final order admitting such person to citizenship, and shall declare the certificate of naturalization of such person to be canceled. Jurisdiction is conferred on the courts having jurisdiction of the trial of such offense to make such adjudication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Cancellation of certificate of naturalization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an order admitting an alien to citizenship shall be revoked and set aside or a certificate of naturalization shall be canceled, or both, as provided in this section, the court in which such judgment or decree is rendered shall make an order canceling such certificate and shall send a certified copy of such order to the Attorney General. The clerk of court shall transmit a copy of such order and judgment to the Attorney General. A person holding a certificate of naturalization or citizenship which has been canceled as provided by this section shall upon notice by the court by which the decree of cancellation was made, or by the Attorney General, surrender the same to the Attorney General.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applicability to certificates of naturalization and citizenship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall apply not only to any naturalization granted and to certificates of naturalization and citizenship issued under the provisions of this subchapter, but to any naturalization heretofore granted by any court, and to all certificates of naturalization and citizenship which may have been issued heretofore by any court or by the Commissioner based upon naturalization granted by any court, or by a designated representative of the Commissioner under the provisions of section 702 of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, or by such designated representative under any other act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Power to correct, reopen, alter, modify, or vacate order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this section shall be regarded as limiting, denying, or restricting the power of the Attorney General to correct, reopen, alter, modify, or vacate an order naturalizing the person.</p>

An action under this subsection may be instituted only within five years after the final administrative denial of such right or privilege and shall be filed in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person resides or claims a residence, and jurisdiction over such officials in such cases is conferred upon those courts.</p>

Upon proof to the satisfaction of such diplomatic or consular officer that such application is made in good faith and has a substantial basis, he shall issue to such person a certificate of identity. From any denial of an application for such certificate the applicant shall be entitled to an appeal to the Secretary of State, who, if he approves the denial, shall state in writing his reasons for his decision. The Secretary of State shall prescribe rules and regulations for the issuance of certificates of identity as above provided. The provisions of this subsection shall be applicable only to a person who at some time prior to his application for the certificate of identity has been physically present in the United States, or to a person under sixteen years of age who was born abroad of a United States citizen parent.</p>

A final determination by the Attorney General that any such person is not entitled to admission to the United States shall be subject to review by any court of competent jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise.

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Director shall attempt to arrange for the placement under the laws of the States of such unaccompanied refugee children, who have been accepted for admission to the United States, before (or as soon as possible after) their arrival in the United States. During any interim period while such a child is in the United States or in transit to the United States but before the child is so placed, the Director shall assume legal responsibility (including financial responsibility) for the child, if necessary, and is authorized to make necessary decisions to provide for the child's immediate care.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Cash assistance provided under this subsection to an employable refugee is conditioned, except for good cause shown&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the refugee's registration with an appropriate agency providing employment services described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section, or, if there is no such agency available, with an appropriate State or local employment service;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Cash assistance shall not be made available to refugees who are full-time students in institutions of higher education (as defined by the Director after consultation with the Secretary of Education).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) refuses to go to a job interview which has been arranged through such agency or service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) refuses to participate in a social service or targeted assistance program referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) which such agency or service determines to be available and appropriate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">cash assistance to the refugee shall be terminated (after opportunity for an administrative hearing) for a period of three months (for the first such refusal) or for a period of six months (for any subsequent refusal).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Director shall develop plans to provide English training and other appropriate services and training to refugees receiving cash assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a refugee is eligible for aid or assistance under a State program funded under part A of title IV or under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq., 1396 et seq.], or for supplemental security income benefits (including State supplementary payments) under the program established under title XVI of that Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.], funds authorized under this subsection shall only be used for the non-Federal share of such aid or assistance, or for such supplementary payments, with respect to cash and medical assistance provided with respect to such refugee under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Director is authorized to allow for the provision of medical assistance under paragraph (1) to any refugee, during the one-year period after entry, who does not qualify for assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] on account of any resources or income requirement of such plan, but only if the Director determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) this will (i) encourage economic self-sufficiency, or (ii) avoid a significant burden on State and local governments; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:349 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the refugee meets such alternative financial resources and income requirements as the Director shall establish.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) As a condition for receiving assistance, reimbursement, or a contract under this subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or agency must provide assurances that whenever a refugee applies for cash or medical assistance for which assistance or reimbursement is provided under this subsection, the State or agency must notify promptly the agency (or local affiliate) which provided for the initial resettlement of the refugee under subsection (b) of this section of the fact that the refugee has so applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The Secretary shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency, and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers. The Secretary may permit alternative projects to cover specific groups of refugees who have been in the United States 36 months or longer if the Secretary determines that refugees in the group have been significantly and disproportionately dependent on welfare and need the services provided under the project in order to become self-sufficient and that their coverage under the projects would be cost-effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be precluded from receiving cash or medical assistance under any other paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 601 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall report to Congress not later than October 31, 1985, on the results of these projects and on any recommendations respecting changes in the refugee assistance program under this section to take into account such results.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) To the extent that the use of such funds is consistent with the purposes of such provisions, funds appropriated under section 1524(a) of this title, part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], or title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], may be used for the purpose of implementing and evaluating alternative projects under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In its provision of assistance to refugees, a State or political subdivision shall consider the recommendations of, and assistance provided by, agencies with grants or contracts under subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Assistance to States and counties for incarceration of certain Cuban nationals; priority for removal and return to Cuba</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall pay compensation to States and to counties for costs incurred by the States and counties to confine in prisons, during the fiscal year for which such payment is made, nationals of Cuba who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) were paroled into the United States in 1980 by the Attorney General,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after such parole committed any violation of State or county law for which a term of imprisonment was imposed, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) at the time of such parole and such violation were not aliens lawfully admitted to the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for permanent residence, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other information as the Attorney General may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a fiscal year the Attorney General shall pay the costs described in paragraph (1) to each State and county determined by the Attorney General to be eligible under paragraph (2); except that if the amounts appropriated for the fiscal year to carry out this subsection are insufficient to cover all such payments, each of such payments shall be ratably reduced so that the total of such payments equals the amounts so appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The authority of the Attorney General to pay compensation under this subsection shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and in such amounts as may be provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) It shall be the policy of the United States Government that the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and all other appropriate Federal officials and all appropriate State and county officials referred to in paragraph (2), shall place top priority on seeking the expeditious removal from this country and the return to Cuba of Cuban nationals described in paragraph (1) by any reasonable and responsible means, and to this end the Attorney General may use the funds authorized to carry out this subsection to conduct such policy.</p>

Such a request may be made ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena would reveal classified evidence or the source of that evidence. The Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment for attendance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an application for a subpoena by the alien also makes a showing that the alien is financially unable to pay for the attendance of a witness so requested, the court may order the costs incurred by the process and the fees of the witness so subpoenaed to be paid from funds appropriated for the enforcement of subchapter II of this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1601. Statements of national policy concerning welfare and immigration</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following statements concerning national policy with respect to welfare and immigration:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country's earliest immigration statutes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) aliens within the Nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the public benefits system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) With respect to the State authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public benefits in this chapter, a State that chooses to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</p>
