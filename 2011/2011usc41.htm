<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government pays more than half a trillion dollars a year to contractors and has an important obligation to protect American taxpayer money and the integrity of the Federal acquisition process. Yet reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) state that Federal contracts are awarded to tens of thousands of companies with serious tax delinquencies. The total amount in unpaid taxes owed by these contracting companies is estimated to be more than $5 billion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Too often, Federal contracting officials do not have the most basic information they need to make informed judgments about whether a company trying to win a Federal contract is delinquent in paying its taxes. We need to give our contracting officials the tools they need to protect taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, I hereby direct the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) to direct a review of certifications of non-delinquency in taxes that companies bidding for Federal contracts are required to submit pursuant to a 2008 amendment to the Federal Ac<!-- PDFPage:21 -->quisition Regulation. I further direct that the Commissioner report to me within 90 days on the overall accuracy of contractors&rsquo; certifications.</p>
<p class="note-body">I also direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, working with the Secretary of the Treasury and other agency heads, to evaluate practices of contracting officers and debarring officials in response to contractors&rsquo; certifications of serious tax delinquencies and to provide me, within 90 days, recommendations on process improvements to ensure these contractors are not awarded new contracts, including a plan to make contractor certifications available in a Government-wide database, as is already being done with other information on contractors.</p>
<p class="note-body">Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Amount of Adjustment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract price adjustment undertaken under section 1502(f)(2) of this title shall be made, where applicable, on relevant contracts between the Federal Government and the contractor that are subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the Federal Government from payment, in the aggregate, of increased costs, as defined by the Cost Accounting Standards Board. The Federal Government may not recover costs greater than the aggregate increased cost to the Federal Government, as defined by the Board, on the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment unless the contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of the price negotiation and which it failed to disclose to the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Interest</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The interest rate applicable to a contract price adjustment is the annual rate of interest established under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621) for the period.

<h4 class="note-head">Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58 F.R. 58095, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity. Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness. The electronic exchange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>1. OBJECTIVES.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) exchange procurement information&mdash;such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents&mdash;electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>2. IMPLEMENTATION.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department or agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) assist the President's Management Council in implementing the electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules established herein; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President's Management Council and serve as <!-- PDFPage:51 -->a point of contact for the development and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each respective department or agency.</p>
<p class="note-body"><strong>3. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.</strong></p>
<p class="note-body">This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13005, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26069, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, it is necessary to secure broad-based competition for Federal contracts. This broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of producing quality goods and services at competitive prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation's economically distressed communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those communities. Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to qualified businesses.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:59 --><p class="note-body">Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 486(a) [now 121(a)] of title 40, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

In developing such policies and procedures, the Secretary shall consider the size of the qualified businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Monitoring and Evaluation</em>. The Secretary shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Government Contracting</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Mar. 4, 2009, 74 F.R. 9755, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government has an overriding obligation to American taxpayers. It should perform its functions efficiently and effectively while ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the taxpayers.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since 2001, spending on Government contracts has more than doubled, reaching over $500 billion in 2008. During this same period, there has been a significant increase in the dollars awarded without full and open competition and an increase in the dollars obligated through cost-reimbursement contracts. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, for example, dollars obligated under cost-reimbursement contracts nearly doubled, from $71 billion in 2000 to $135 billion in 2008. Reversing these trends away from full and open competition and toward cost-reimbursement contracts could result in savings of billions of dollars each year for the American taxpayer.</p>
<p class="note-body">Excessive reliance by executive agencies on sole-source contracts (or contracts with a limited number of sources) and cost-reimbursement contracts creates a risk that taxpayer funds will be spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the needs of the Federal Government or the interests of the American taxpayer. Reports by agency Inspectors General, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and other independent reviewing bodies have shown that noncompetitive and cost-reimbursement contracts have been misused, resulting in wasted taxpayer resources, poor contractor performance, and inadequate accountability for results.</p>
<p class="note-body">When awarding Government contracts, the Federal Government must strive for an open and competitive process. However, executive agencies must have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out their missions and achieve the policy goals of the Government. In certain exigent circumstances, agencies may need to consider whether a competitive process will not accomplish the agency's mission. In such cases, the agency must ensure that the risks associated with noncompetitive contracts are minimized.</p>
<p class="note-body">Moreover, it is essential that the Federal Government have the capacity to carry out robust and thorough management and oversight of its contracts in order to achieve programmatic goals, avoid significant overcharges, and curb wasteful spending. A GAO study last year of 95 major defense acquisitions projects found cost overruns of 26 percent, totaling $295 billion over the life of the projects. Improved contract oversight could reduce such sums significantly.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:60 --><p class="note-body">Government outsourcing for services also raises special concerns. For decades, the Federal Government has relied on the private sector for necessary commercial services used by the Government, such as transportation, food, and maintenance. Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;76, first issued in 1966, was based on the reasonable premise that while inherently governmental activities should be performed by Government employees, taxpayers may receive more value for their dollars if non-inherently governmental activities that can be provided commercially are subject to the forces of competition.</p>
<p class="note-body">However, the line between inherently governmental activities that should not be outsourced and commercial activities that may be subject to private sector competition has been blurred and inadequately defined. As a result, contractors may be performing inherently governmental functions. Agencies and departments must operate under clear rules prescribing when outsourcing is and is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is the policy of the Federal Government that executive agencies shall not engage in noncompetitive contracts except in those circumstances where their use can be fully justified and where appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect the taxpayer. In addition, there shall be a preference for fixed-price type contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts shall be used only when circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract. Moreover, the Federal Government shall ensure that taxpayer dollars are not spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the Federal Government's needs and to manage the risk associated with the goods and services being procured. The Federal Government must have sufficient capacity to manage and oversee the contracting process from start to finish, so as to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent wisely and are not subject to excessive risk. Finally, the Federal Government must ensure that those functions that are inherently governmental in nature are performed by executive agencies and are not outsourced.</p>
<p class="note-body">I hereby direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator of General Services, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the heads of such other agencies as the Director of OMB determines to be appropriate, and with the participation of appropriate management councils and program management officials, to develop and issue by July 1, 2009, Government-wide guidance to assist agencies in reviewing, and creating processes for ongoing review of, existing contracts in order to identify contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, or not otherwise likely to meet the agency's needs, and to formulate appropriate corrective action in a timely manner. Such corrective action may include modifying or canceling such contracts in a manner and to the extent consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">I further direct the Director of OMB, in collaboration with the aforementioned officials and councils, and with input from the public, to develop and issue by September 30, 2009, Government-wide guidance to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) govern the appropriate use and oversight of sole-source and other types of noncompetitive contracts and to maximize the use of full and open competition and other competitive procurement processes;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) govern the appropriate use and oversight of all contract types, in full consideration of the agency's needs, and to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts generally, consistent with the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to section 864 of Public Law 110&ndash;417;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) assist agencies in assessing the capacity and ability of the Federal acquisition workforce to develop, manage, and oversee acquisitions appropriately; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is not appropriate, consistent with section 321 of Public Law 110&ndash;417 (31 U.S.C. 501 note).</p>
<p class="note-body">Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Federal Government would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a Federally funded research and development center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing, or proceeding before a court, administrative tribunal, or agency, whether or not the expert is expected to testify; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to procure the services of an expert or neutral for use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is expected to testify;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the Federal Government and a foreign government or an international organization, or the written directions of a foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost of the procurement of the property or services for that government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures other than competitive procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to section 3105 of this title, a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made through another executive agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the disclosure of the executive agency's needs would compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the head of the executive agency (who may not delegate the authority under this paragraph)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to use procedures other than competitive procedures in the particular procurement concerned; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, the property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) substantial duplication of cost to the Federal Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) unacceptable delay in fulfilling the executive agency's needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Offer Requests to Potential Sources</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An executive agency using procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property or services by reason of the application of paragraph (2) or (6) of subsection (a) shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Content of proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the Federal Government will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in substantial quantities during the service life of the system. Proposals submitted in response to this requirement may include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Proposals to provide to the Federal Government the right to use technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the Federal Government of <!-- PDFPage:71 -->acquiring the data and the right to use the data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple sources of supply for the item.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Factors as Objectives in Negotiations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of a development contract or a production contract for a major system, the factors specified in subsections (a) and (b) to be considered in evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives in negotiating the contract to be awarded.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build established under sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40 or another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a determination is made under subsection (b) that the procedures are appropriate for use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Criteria for Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design and construction of a public building, facility, or work when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the contracting officer anticipates that 3 or more offers will be received for the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) design work must be performed before an offeror can develop a price or cost proposal for the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the offeror will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the contracting officer has considered information such as the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The extent to which the project requirements have been adequately defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The time constraints for delivery of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The capability and experience of potential contractors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase selection procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Other criteria established by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Procedures Described</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Development of scope of work statement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that defines the project and provides prospective offerors with sufficient information regarding the Federal Government's requirements (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the offerors to submit proposals that meet the Federal Government's needs. If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and engineering services as defined by and in accordance with sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation of phase-one proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) include information on the offeror's&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) technical approach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) technical qualifications; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) do not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) detailed design information; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) cost or price information.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Evaluation factors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-engineer and construction members of the team), and other appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Selection by contracting officer.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Number of offerors selected and what is to be evaluated</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer selects as the most highly qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to provide the property or services under the contract and requests the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals that include technical proposals and cost or price information. Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the technical submission for the proposal, including design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed within the scope of work, or both; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals in accordance with subsections (b) to (d) of section 3306 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Separate evaluations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Awarding of contract</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The agency awards the contract in accordance with chapter 37 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:72 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation To State Number of Offerors To Be Selected for Phase-Two Requests for Competitive Proposals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in subsection (c) shall state the maximum number of offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals pursuant to subsection (c)(4). The maximum number specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number greater than 5 is in the Federal Government's interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase selection process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Requirement for Guidance and Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by subsection (a) are appropriate for use in individual contracting situations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting contractors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-wide.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, the term &ldquo;qualification requirement&rdquo; means a requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed by an offeror before award of a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Actions Before Enforcing Qualification Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subsection (c), the head of an agency, before enforcing any qualification requirement, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) specify in writing and make available to a potential offeror on request all requirements that a prospective offeror, or its product, must satisfy to become qualified, with those requirements to be limited to those least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specify an estimate of the cost of testing and evaluation likely to be incurred by a potential offeror to become qualified;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, on request, a prompt opportunity to demonstrate at its own expense (except as provided in subsection (d)) its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification using&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) qualified personnel and facilities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) of the agency concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) of another agency obtained through interagency agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) under contract; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under contract to the agency for the purposes of paragraph (4), provide to the extent possible that those services be provided by a contractor that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is not expected to benefit from an absence of additional qualified sources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is required in the contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is promptly informed whether qualification is attained and, if not attained, is promptly furnished specific information about why qualification was not attained.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:73 --><p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Applicability, Waiver Authority, and Referral of Offers.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Applicability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subsection (b) does not apply to a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Waiver authority.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Submission of determination of unreasonableness</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subparagraph (C), if it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification that a prospective offeror or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Authority to grant waiver</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2) to (5) of subsection (b) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Nonapplicability to qualified products list</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Waiver authority under this paragraph does not apply with respect to a qualified products list.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Submission and consideration of offer not to be denied</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a qualification requirement if the potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror or its product meets the standards established for qualification or can meet those standards before the date specified for award of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Referral to small business administration not required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not require the referral of an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)) if the basis for the referral is a challenge by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification requirement or the offeror's compliance with that requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Delay of procurement not required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement to comply with subsection (b) or to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Solicitation and testing of additional sources or products</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the number of qualified sources or qualified products available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement is fewer than 2 actual manufacturers or the products of 2 actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency concerned shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) publish notice periodically soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification, unless the contracting officer determines that doing so would compromise national security; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to paragraph (2), bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the cost associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern that has met the standards specified for qualification and that could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>When agency may bear cost</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of the agency concerned may bear the cost under paragraph (1)(B) only if the head of the agency determines that the additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements) the cost incurred by the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Certification required</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The head of the agency shall require a prospective contractor requesting the Federal Government to bear testing and evaluation costs under paragraph (1)(B) to certify its status as a small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Examination and Revalidation of Qualification Requirement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within 7 years after the establishment of a qualification requirement, the need for the requirement shall be examined and the standards of the requirement revalidated in accordance with the requirements of subsection (b). This subsection does not apply in the case of a qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under subsection (c)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>When Enforcement of Qualification Requirement Not Allowed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency, after the head of the agency determines not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not enforce the requirement unless the agency complies with the requirements of subsection (b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under section 3502(b) of this title is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the Federal Government, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that the price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make the certificate available) submitted defective cost or pricing data.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>What constitutes defective cost or pricing data</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this chapter, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data that, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed on between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent.

When the Federal Government contracts for goods or services, it has a proprietary interest in ensuring that those contracts will be performed by contractors whose work will not be interrupted by labor unrest. The attainment of industrial peace is most easily achieved and workers&rsquo; productivity is enhanced when workers are well informed of their rights under Federal labor laws, including the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. 151 <em>et seq</em>. As the Act recognizes, &ldquo;encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection&rdquo; will &ldquo;eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce&rdquo; and &ldquo;mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred.&rdquo; 29 U.S.C. 151. Relying on contractors whose employees are informed of such rights under Federal labor laws facilitates the efficient and economical completion of the Federal Government's contracts.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Contract Clause</em>. Except in contracts exempted in accordance with section 3 of this order, all Government contracting departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, include the following provisions in every Government contract, other than collective bargaining agreements as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(8) and purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 403.</p>

The notice shall include the information contained in the notice published by the Secretary of Labor in the Federal Register (Secretary's Notice).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;2. The contractor will comply with all provisions of the Secretary's Notice, and related rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.</p>

Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided in Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]], or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as are otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) above in every subcontract entered into in connection with this contract (unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]) so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: Provided, however, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13502. Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13502, Feb. 6, 2009, 74 F.R. 6985, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to promote the efficient administration and completion of Federal construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. (a) Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal Government. Construction employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed. Challenges also arise due to the fact that construction projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location. A labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project. A lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can create frictions and disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon resolution mechanism. These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors. On larger projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these problems from developing by providing structure and stability to large-scale construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient and expeditious completion of Federal construction contracts. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage executive agencies to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;labor organization&rdquo; as used in this order means a labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The term &ldquo;construction&rdquo; as used in this order means construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of buildings, highways, or other real property.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The term &ldquo;large-scale construction project&rdquo; as used in this order means a construction project where the total cost to the Federal Government is $25 million or more.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The term &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; as used in this order has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but excludes the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The term &ldquo;project labor agreement&rdquo; as used in this order means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) In awarding any contract in connection with a large-scale construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a contract, executive agencies may, on a project-by-project basis, require the use of a project labor agreement by a contractor where use of such an agreement will (i) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters, and (ii) be consistent with law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If an executive agency determines under subsection (a) that the use of a project labor agreement will satisfy the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor or subcontractor on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate labor organizations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to this order shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the Construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the project labor agreement;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. This order does not require an executive agency to use a project labor agreement on any construction project, nor does it preclude the use of a project labor agreement in circumstances not covered by this order, including leasehold arrangements and projects receiving Federal financial assistance. This order also does not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), to the extent permitted by law, shall take whatever action is required to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the provisions of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and with other officials as appropriate, shall provide the President within 180 days of this order, recommendations about whether broader use of project labor agreements, with respect to both construction projects undertaken under Federal contracts and construction projects receiving Federal financial assistance, would help to promote the economical, efficient, and timely completion of such projects.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Revocation of Prior Orders, Rules, and Regulations</em>. Executive Order 13202 of February 17, 2001, and Executive Order 13208 of April 6, 2001, are revoked. The heads of executive agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, revoke expeditiously any orders, rules, or regulations implementing Executive Orders 13202 and 13208.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <em>General</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Definition</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section, a multiyear contract is a contract for the purchase of property or services for more than one, but not more than 5, program years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Authority To Enter Into Contract</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An executive agency may enter into a multiyear contract for the acquisition of property or services if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) funds are available and obligated for the contract, for the full period of the contract or for the first fiscal year in which the contract is in effect, and for the estimated costs associated with a necessary termination of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the executive agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the need for the property or services is reasonably firm and continuing over the period of the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a multiyear contract will serve the best interests of the Federal Government by encouraging full and open competition or promoting economy in administration, performance, and operation of the agency's programs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Termination Clause</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A multiyear contract entered into under the authority of this section shall include a clause that provides that the contract shall be terminated if funds are not made available for the continuation of the contract in a fiscal year covered by the contract. Funds available for paying termination costs shall remain available for that purpose until the costs associated with termination of the contract are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Cancellation Ceiling Notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Before a contract described in subsection (b) that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $10,000,000 may be awarded, the executive agency shall give written notification of the proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to Congress. The contract may not be awarded until the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the notification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Contingency Clause for Appropriation of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A multiyear contract may provide that performance under the contract after the first year of the contract is contingent on the appropriation of funds and (if the contract does so provide) that a cancellation payment shall be made to the contractor if the funds are not appropriated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Decision on Validity of Asserted Restriction.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>No response submitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The contracting officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction if the contractor or subcontractor does not submit a response under subsection (b).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Claim Deemed Claim Within Chapter</cap-smallcap> 71.&mdash;A claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction that is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or subcontractor at any tier is deemed to be a claim within the meaning of chapter 71 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Final Disposition of Challenge.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Challenge is sustained</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data is sustained on final disposition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the restriction is cancelled; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, is liable to the Federal Government for payment of the cost to the Federal Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the Federal Government in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make the payment unjust.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Challenge not sustained</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the contracting officer's challenge to the restriction on the right of the Federal Government to use technical data is not sustained on final disposition, the Federal Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) continues to be bound by the restriction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is liable for payment to the party asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction if the challenge by the Federal Government is found not to be made in good faith.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Investigation of Complaints</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An individual who believes that the individual has been subjected to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (b) may submit a complaint to the Inspector General of the executive agency. Unless the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous, the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, on completion of the investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the individual, the contractor concerned, and the head of the agency. If the executive agency does not have an Inspector General, the duties of the Inspector General under this section shall be performed by an official designated by the head of the executive agency.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement order</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a contractor fails to comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the head of the executive agency shall file an action for enforcement of the order in the United States district court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have occurred.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;In this section&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as used in this Act&rdquo; as the probable intent of Congress. Section 9(a) of the Act of August 2, 1946 (ch. 744, 60 Stat. 809) restated 41:5 generally and section 9(c) of the Act, an independent provision, was editorially added as the last paragraph of 41:5. The definitions which apply to &ldquo;as used in this Act&rdquo; are probably intended to apply also to 41:5 as re<!-- PDFPage:106 -->stated by the Act. The definitions for &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;continental United States&rdquo; are omitted because those terms do not appear in 41:5. In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;section 9104 of title 31&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;section 104 of the Government Corporation Control Act, approved December 6, 1945&rdquo; because of section 4(b) of Public Law. 97&ndash;258 (31 U.S.C. note prec. 101). In paragraphs (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;shall be construed to include&rdquo; and for &ldquo;shall be construed as including&rdquo;, respectively, to eliminate unnecessary words.</p>

A purported transfer in violation of this subsection annuls the contract or order so far as the Federal Government is concerned, except that all rights of action for breach of contract are reserved to the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Assignment.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (a) and in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, amounts due from the Federal Government under a contract may be assigned to a bank, trust company, Federal lending agency, or other financing institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Minimum amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection applies only to a contract under which the aggregate amounts due from the Federal Government total at least $1,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) <cap-smallcap>Single assignment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Unless otherwise expressly permitted by the contract, an assignment under this subsection may not be made to more than one party or be subject to further assignment, except that assignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for 2 or more parties participating in the financing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) <cap-smallcap>Written notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The assignee of an assignment under this subsection shall file written notice of the assignment and a true copy of the instrument of assignment with&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) <cap-smallcap>Validity</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding any law to the contrary governing the validity of assignments, an assignment under this subsection is a valid assignment for all purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) <cap-smallcap>No refund to cover assignor's liability</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The assignee of an assignment under this subsection is not liable to make any refund to the Federal Government because of an assignor's liability to the Federal Government, whether that liability arises from the contract or independently.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) <cap-smallcap>Avoiding reduction or setoff with certain contracts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Contract provision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy, or another department or agency of the Federal Government designated by the President may, on a determination of need by the President, provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments made to an assignee under the contract are not subject to reduction or setoff. Each determination of need by the President under this subparagraph shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Carrying out contract provision</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When a &ldquo;no reduction or setoff&rdquo; provision as described in subparagraph (A) is included in a contract, payments to the assignee are not subject to reduction or setoff for an assignor's liability arising&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) independently of the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) on account of renegotiation under a renegotiation statute or under a statutory renegotiation article in the contract;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) on account of taxes, social security contributions, or the withholding or non-withholding of taxes or social security contributions, whether arising from or independently of the contract.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subparagraph (B)(iv) does not apply to amounts which may be collected or withheld from the assignor in accordance with or for failure to comply with the terms of the contract.</p>

Section 207(a) and (f) was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 676). Section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 1) enacted Title 10, &ldquo;Armed Forces&rdquo; and under subtitle D of title 10 the Department of the Air Force remained an independent administrative entity in the Department of Defense.</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13126, June 12, 1999, 64 F.R. 32383, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to continue the executive branch's commitment to fighting abusive child labor practices, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap>. 1. <em>Policy</em>. It shall be the policy of the United States Government, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1307, the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938], 29 U.S.C. 201 <em>et. seq</em>., and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act [Walsh-Healey Act], [former] 41 U.S.C. 35 <em>et seq</em>. [see 41 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.], that executive agencies shall take appropriate actions to enforce the laws prohibiting the manufacture or importation of goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced or indentured child labor.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Publication of List</em>. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Department of Labor, in consultation and cooperation with the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State, shall publish in the Federal Register a list of products, identified by their country of origin, that those Departments have a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. The Department of Labor may conduct hearings to assist in the identification of those products.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Procurement Regulations</em>. Within 120 days after the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue proposed rules to implement the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Required Solicitation Provisions</em>. Each solicitation of offers for a contract for the procurement of a product included on the list published under section 2 of this order shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A provision that requires the contractor to certify to the contracting officer that the contractor or, in the case of an incorporated contractor, a responsible official of the contractor has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract and that, on the basis of those efforts, the contractor is unaware of any such use of child labor; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A provision that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to the contractor's records, documents, persons, or premises if reasonably requested by authorized officials of the contracting agency, the Department of the Treasury, or the Department of Justice, for the purpose of determining whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the contract.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Investigations</em>. Whenever a contracting officer of an executive agency has reason to believe that forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture a product furnished pursuant to a contract subject to the requirements of subsection 3(a) of this order, the head of the executive agency shall refer the matter for investigation to the Inspector General of the executive agency and, as the head of the executive agency or the Inspector General determines appropriate, to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Remedies.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(1) The head of an executive agency may impose remedies as provided in this subsection in the case of a contractor under a contract of the executive agency if the head of the executive agency finds that the contractor:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) Has furnished under the contract products that have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor or uses forced or indentured child labor in the mining, production, or manufacturing operations of the contractor;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) Has submitted a false certification under subsection 3(a)(1) of this order; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(iii) Has failed to cooperate in accordance with the obligation imposed pursuant to subsection 3(a)(2) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The head of an executive agency, in his or her sole discretion, may terminate a contract on the basis of any finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order for any contract entered into after the date the regulation called for in section 3 of this order is published in final.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) The head of an executive agency may debar or suspend a contractor from eligibility for Federal contracts on the basis of a finding that the contractor has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order. The provision for debarment may not exceed 3 years.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The Administrator of General Services shall include on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs (maintained by the Administrator as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) each party that is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment or suspension, or declared ineligible by the head of an agency on the basis that the person has engaged in an act described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) This section shall not be construed to limit the use of other remedies available to the head of an executive agency or any other official of the Federal Government on the basis of a finding described in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Report</em>. Within 2 years after implementation of any final rule under this order, the Administrator of General Services, with the assistance of other executive agencies, shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget a report on the actions taken pursuant to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Scope</em>. (a) Any proposed rules issued pursuant to section 3 of this order shall apply only to acquisitions for a total amount in excess of the micro-purchase threshold as defined in section 32(f) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 428(f)).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order does not apply to a contract that is for the procurement of any product, or any article, material, or supply contained in a product that is mined, produced, or manufactured in any foreign country if:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) the foreign country is a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement (&ldquo;NAFTA&rdquo;); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the United States threshold specified in the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or NAFTA, whichever is applicable.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:112 --><p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Definitions</em>. (a) &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;agency&rdquo; have the meaning given to &ldquo;executive agency&rdquo; in section 4(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(1)).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;WTO Agreement&rdquo; means the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, entered into on April 15, 1994.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Forced or indentured child labor&rdquo; means all work or service (1) exacted from any person under the age of 18 under the menace of any penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself voluntarily; or (2) performed by any person under the age of 18 pursuant to a contract the enforcement of which can be accomplished by process or penalties.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A contract made by an agency of the United States for the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment, in an amount exceeding $10,000, shall include the following representations and stipulations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Minimum wages to be paid</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;All individuals employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract will be paid, without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, not less than the prevailing minimum wages, as determined by the Secretary, for individuals employed in similar work or in the particular or similar industries or groups of industries currently operating in the locality in which the materials, supplies, articles, or equipment are to be manufactured or furnished under the contract, except that this paragraph applies only to purchases or contracts relating to industries that have been the subject matter of a determination by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Maximum number of hours to be worked in a week</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No individual employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract shall be permitted to work in excess of 40 hours in any one week, except that this paragraph does not apply to an employer who has entered into an agreement with employees pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of section 7(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(b)(1) or (2)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) <cap-smallcap>Ineligible employees</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No individual under 16 years of age and no incarcerated individual will be employed by the contractor in the manufacture or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment under the contract, except that this section, or other law or executive order containing similar prohibitions against the purchase of goods by the Federal Government, does not apply to convict labor that satisfies the conditions of section 1761(c) of title 18.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Standards of places and working conditions where contract performed</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No part of the contract will be performed, and no materials, supplies, articles, or equipment will be manufactured or fabricated under the contract, in plants, factories, buildings, or surroundings, or under working conditions, that are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health and safety of employees engaged in the performance of the contract. Compliance with the safety, sanitary, and factory inspection laws of the State in which the work or part of the work is to be performed is prima facie evidence of compliance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the matter before paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;and entered into&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;under the contract&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;used in the performance of the contract&rdquo; in 41:35(a) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter. The words &ldquo;Sections 35 to 45 of this title shall apply to all contracts entered into pursuant to invitations for bids issued on or after ninety days from June 30, 1936&rdquo; in 41:45 are omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (2), the words &ldquo;under the contract&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;used in the performance of the contract&rdquo; to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (3), the words &ldquo;No individual under 16 years of age&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;no male person under sixteen years of age and no female person under eighteen years of age&rdquo; to reflect the interpretation of this provision subsequent to enactment of civil rights laws such as section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42:2000e&ndash;2), as carried out by the Department of Labor through 41 C.F.R. Part 50&ndash;201.104. The words &ldquo;incarcerated individual&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; the first time the words appear because the term &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; is ambiguous and may be interpreted to include individuals who are not incarcerated. This would be an inappropriate interpretation because 41:35(c) provides an exception for &ldquo;convict labor&rdquo; that satisfies the conditions of 18:1761(c) regarding certain non-Federal prison work projects. The words &ldquo;or production&rdquo; are omitted for consistency with the source provisions for paragraphs (1) and (2) and because, in this context, the concept of &ldquo;production&rdquo; is included in the words &ldquo;manufacture or furnishing&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;under the contract&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;included in such contract&rdquo; for consistency in the chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the duty to make findings of fact is restated as a duty of the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative). The grammatical structure of the last sentence of 41:39 seems to suggest that the court, rather than the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative), serves as fact finder. However, the provision taken as a whole indicates that it is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) who serves as fact finder. It is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) before whom hearings are held, witnesses testify, and evidence is produced. The court's involvement is limited to compelling recalcitrant witnesses &ldquo;to appear before him [the Secretary] or representative designated by him&rdquo;. The restatement clarifies the generally accepted understanding that the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) serves as fact finder (see, e.g., <em>United States v. Sweet Briar</em>, 92 F. Supp. 777, 780 (W.D.S.C. 1950) (&ldquo;the Secretary &lsquo;shall make findings of fact&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;); <em>Ready-Mix Concrete Company v. United States</em>, 158 F. Supp. 571, 578 (Cl.

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13495. Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13495, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6103, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is awarded for the same service, at the same location, the successor contractor or its subcontractors often hires the majority of the predecessor's employees. On some occasions, however, a successor contractor or its subcontractors hires a new work force, thus displacing the predecessor's employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are served when the successor contractor hires the predecessor's employees. A carryover work force reduces disruption to the delivery of services during the period of transition between contractors and provides the Federal Government the benefits of an experienced and trained work force that is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq</em>., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the Federal Government that service contracts and solicitations for such contracts shall include a clause that requires the contractor, and its subcontractors, under a contract that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services at the same location, to offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. There shall be no employment openings under the contract until such right of first refusal has been provided. Nothing in this order shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive Order or law of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Service contract&rdquo; or &ldquo;contract&rdquo; means any contract or subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its contractors that is covered by the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 351 <em>et seq</em>., and its implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Employee&rdquo; means a service employee as defined in the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. 357(b).</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Exclusions</em>. This order shall not apply to:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) contracts or subcontracts under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in 41 U.S.C. 403;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) contracts or subcontracts awarded pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 46&ndash;48c;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services provided to the Federal Government under contracts or subcontracts with sheltered workshops employing the severely handicapped as described in section 505 of the Treasury, Postal Services [sic] and General Government Appropriations Act, 1995, Public Law 103&ndash;329;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to the preference regulations issued under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:119 --><p class="note-body">(e) employees who were hired to work under a Federal service contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a single job, provided that the employees were not deployed in a manner that was designed to avoid the purposes of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Authority to Exempt Contracts</em>. If the head of a contracting department or agency finds that the application of any of the requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of this order or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis, the head of such department or agency may exempt its department or agency from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of this order with respect to a particular contract, subcontract, or purchase order or any class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Contract Clause</em>. The following contract clause shall be included in solicitations for and service contracts that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar work at the same location:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which employees are qualified. The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. Except as provided in paragraph (b) there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. The contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) above, the contractor and any subcontractors (1) may employ under this contract any employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least 3 months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (2) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 357(b), and (3) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222&ndash;41(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. The Contracting Officer will provide the list to the successor contractor, and the list shall be provided on request to employees or their representatives.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order (No.) &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; [13495], the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) In every subcontract entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the contractor will include provisions that ensure that each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b) with respect to the employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its subcontractors. The subcontract shall also include provisions to ensure that the subcontractor will provide the contractor with the information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the contractor to comply with paragraph 5(c), above. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the contractor may request that the United States enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Enforcement</em>. (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) is responsible for investigating and obtaining compliance with this order. In such proceedings, the Secretary shall have the authority to issue final orders prescribing appropriate sanctions and remedies, including, but not limited to, orders requiring employment and payment of wages lost. The Secretary also may provide that where a contractor or subcontractor has failed to comply with any order of the Secretary or has committed willful violations of this order or the regulations issued pursuant thereto, the contractor or subcontractor, and its responsible officers, and any firm in which the contractor or subcontractor has a substantial interest, shall be ineligible to be awarded any contract of the United States for a period of up to 3 years. Neither an order for debarment of any contractor or subcontractor from further Government contracts under this section nor the inclusion of a contractor or subcontractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors shall be carried out without affording the contractor or subcontractor an opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act [of 1978] [see 41 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.], and disputes regarding the requirement of the contract clause prescribed by section 5 of this order, to the extent permitted by law, shall be disposed of only as provided by the Secretary in regulations issued under this order. To the extent practicable, such regulations shall favor the resolution of disputes by efficient and informal alternative dispute resolution methods. The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, issue regulations, within 180 days of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, to implement the requirements of this order. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue, within 180 days of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion of the contract clause in Federal solicitations and contracts subject to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Revocation</em>. Executive Order 13204 of February 17, 2001, is revoked.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Severability</em>. If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision or amendment to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:120 --><p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. This order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final decisions by the Secretary in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq</em>.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <em>Effective Date</em>. This order shall become effective immediately and shall apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date for the action taken by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council under section 6(b) of this order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Liability of Responsible Party</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A party responsible for a violation of a contract provision required under section 6703(1) or (2) of this title or a violation of section 6704 of this title is liable for an amount equal to the sum of any deduction, rebate, refund, or underpayment of compensation due any employee engaged in the performance of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Recovery of Amounts Underpaid to Employees.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>Withholding accrued payments due on contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The total amount determined under subsection (a) to be due any employee engaged in the performance of a contract may be withheld from accrued payments due on the contract or on any other contract between the same contractor and the Federal Government. The amount withheld shall be held in a deposit fund.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Bringing actions against contractors</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the contract are insufficient to reimburse a service employee with respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the compensation required pursuant to this chapter, the Federal Government may bring action against the contractor, subcontractor, or any sureties in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the remaining amount of underpayment. Any amount recovered shall be held in the deposit fund and shall be paid, on order of the Secretary, directly to the underpaid employee.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Enforcement of Chapter</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Sections 6506 and 6507 of this title govern the Secretary's authority to enforce this chapter, including the Secretary's authority to prescribe regulations, issue orders, hold hearings, make decisions based on findings of fact, and take other appropriate action under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Limitations and Regulations for Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary may provide reasonable limitations and may prescribe regulations allowing reasonable variation, tolerances, and exemptions with respect to this chapter (other than subsection (f)), but only in special circumstances where the Secretary determines that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of Federal Government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of this chapter to protect prevailing labor standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of Wages and Benefits Due Under Predecessor Contracts.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Under a contract which succeeds a contract subject to this chapter, and under which substantially the same services are furnished, a contractor or subcontractor may not pay a service employee less than the wages and fringe benefits the service employee would have received under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective-bargaining agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subsection does not apply if the Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with regulations adopted by the Secretary that wages and fringe benefits under the predecessor contract are substantially at variance with wages and fringe benefits prevailing in the same locality for services of a similar character.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Duration of Contracts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to limitations in annual appropriation acts but notwithstanding any other law, a contract to which this chapter applies may, if authorized by the Secretary, be for any term of years not exceeding 5, if the contract provides for periodic adjustment of wages and fringe benefits pursuant to future determinations, issued in the manner prescribed in section 6703 of this title at least once every 2 years during the term of the contract, covering each class of service employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Exclusion of Fringe Benefit Payments in Determining Overtime Pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining any overtime pay to which a service employee is entitled under Federal law, the regular or basic hourly rate of pay of the service employee does not include any fringe benefit payments computed under this chapter which are excluded from the definition of &ldquo;regular rate&rdquo; under section 7(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(e)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Timeliness of Wage and Fringe Benefit Determinations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the intent of Congress that determinations of minimum wages and fringe benefits under section 6703(1) and (2) of this title should be made as soon as administratively feasible for all contracts subject to this chapter. In any event, the Secretary shall at least make the determinations for contracts under which more than 5 service employees are to be employed.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is substituted for &ldquo;The interest provided for in this section shall be paid at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92&ndash;41 (85 Stat. 97) for the Renegotiation Board&rdquo; to eliminate obsolete language and to codify the criteria under which the interest rate is computed. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act of July 1, 1971 (Pub. L. 92&ndash;41, 85 Stat. 97), amended section 105(b)(2) of the Renegotiation Act of 1951 (Mar. 23, 1951, ch. 15, 65 Stat. 13) by adding provisions substantially similar to those enacted here. However, the Renegotiation Act of 1951 (Mar. 23, 1951, ch. 15, 65 Stat. 7) was omitted from the Code pursuant to section 102(c)(1) of the Act (65 Stat. 8), amended several times, the last being Public Law 94&ndash;185 (89 Stat. 1061), which provided that most provisions of that Act do not apply to receipts and accruals attributable to contract performance after September 30, 1976, and in view of the termination of the Renegotiation Board and the transfer of property and records of the Board to the Administrator of the General Services Administration on March 31, 1979, pursuant to Public Law 95&ndash;431 (92 Stat. 1043). Although the Renegotiation Board is no longer in existence, Federal agencies, including the General Services Administration, are required to use interest rates that are computed under the criteria set out in this subsection. See 31:3902(a) and the website of the Bureau of the Public Debt, available at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdprmt2.htm. For an example of publication of rates under the criteria enacted here, see Federal Register, volume 67, number 247, page 78566, December 24, 2002.</p>

(a) For the purposes of this order materials shall be considered to be of foreign origin if the cost of the foreign products used in such materials constitutes fifty per centum or more of the cost of all the products used in such materials.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) For the purposes of the said act of March 3, 1933 [probably means act Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212, title III, 47 Stat. 1520, see 41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.], and the other laws referred to in the first paragraph of the preamble of this order, the bid or offered price of materials of domestic origin shall be deemed to be unreasonable, or the purchase of such materials shall be deemed to be inconsistent with the public interest, if the bid or offered price thereof exceeds the sum of the bid or offered price of like materials of foreign origin and a differential computed as provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The executive agency concerned shall in each instance determine the amount of the differential referred to in subsection (b) of this section on the basis of one of the following-described formulas, subject to the terms thereof:</p>

<p class="note-body">(2) The sum determined by computing ten per centum of the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin exclusive of applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States: provided that when the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin amounts to less than $25,000, the sum shall be determined by computing ten per centum of such price exclusive only of applicable duty.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. Nothing in this order shall affect the authority or responsibility of an executive agency:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) To reject any bid or offer for reasons of the national interest not described or referred to in this order; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) To place a fair proportion of the total purchases with small business concerns in accordance with section 302(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [former 41 U.S.C. 252(b)] [now 41 U.S.C. 3104], [former] section 2(b) of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, as amended, and [former] section 202 of the Small Business Act of 1953; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) To reject a bid or offer to furnish material of foreign origin in any situation in which the domestic supplier offering the lowest price for furnishing the desired materials undertakes to produce substantially all of such materials in areas of substantial unemployment, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with such appropriate regulations as he may establish and during such period as the President may determine that it is in the national interest to provide to such areas preference in the award of Government contracts: <em>Provided</em>, that nothing in this section shall prevent the rejection of a bid or offered price which is excessive; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) To reject any bid or offer for materials of foreign origin if such rejection is necessary to protect essential national-security interests after receiving advice with respect thereto from the President or from the Director [now Administrator] of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In providing this advice the Director [Administrator] shall be governed by the principle that exceptions under this section shall be made only upon a clear showing that the payment of a greater differential than the procedures of this section generally prescribe is justified by consideration of national security.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. The head of each executive agency shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to insure that procurement practices under his jurisdiction conform to the provisions of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. This order shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date hereof. In any case in which the head of an executive agency proposing to purchase domestic materials determines that a greater differential than that provided in this order between the cost of such materials of domestic origin and materials of foreign origin is not unreasonable or that the purchase of materials of domestic origin is not inconsistent with the public interest, this order shall not apply. A written report of the facts of each case in which such a de<!-- PDFPage:135 -->termination is made shall be submitted to the President through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by the official making the determination within 30 days thereafter.</p>

The Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia are not included because although they were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, they are independent entities and not part of the United States.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(F), the words &ldquo;Department of Education&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Department of Health and Human Services&rdquo; in 41:46(a)(1) to correct a mistake in the United States Code. In the amendment to the original provision by section 1 of Public Law 92&ndash;28 (85 Stat. 77), an officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was one of the members appointed to the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, because the Department, through the Rehabilitation Services Administration, had the major governmental function in the field of vocational rehabilitation for the blind and other severely handicapped and administered related vocational rehabilitation programs for individuals with disabilities. See House Report 92&ndash;228. Under section 301(a)(4)(A) and (C) and (b)(3) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20:3441(a)(4)(A) and (C) and (b)(3)), the functions and offices of the Department and the functions of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services were transferred to the Department or Secretary of Education. Section 509 of the Act (20:3508) redesignated the Department and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare as the Department and Secretary of Health and Human Services, respectively, and provided that references to the Department and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare were deemed to be references to the Department or Secretary of Health and Human Services except to the extent a reference was to a function of the Department or Secretary of Education. The reference in 41:46(a)(1) was changed to &ldquo;Department of Health and Human Services&rdquo; but should have been changed to &ldquo;Department of Education&rdquo;. Furthermore, the regulations of the Committee include the Department of Education in the list of members of the Committee. See 41 CFR 51&ndash;2.1.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the text of 41:46(d)(2) and (4) is omitted as obsolete.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f)(1), the reference to section 5376 of title 5 is substituted for the reference to grade GS&ndash;18 of the General Schedule because of section 529 [title I, &sect;101(c)(1)] of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101&ndash;509, 104 Stat. 1442, 5 U.S.C. 5376 note). The word &ldquo;actual&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. The words &ldquo;A member is entitled to travel expenses, including a per diem allowance instead of subsistence, as provided under section 5703 of title 5&rdquo; are substituted for 41:46(e)(3) to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to section 5703 of title 5 is substituted for the reference to section 5703(b) of title 5 because of the amendment to section 5703 by section 4 of the Travel Expense Amendments Act of 1975 (Public Law 94&ndash;22, 89 Stat. 85).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &ldquo;its duties and powers&rdquo; are omitted as surplus.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g)(1), the reference to chapter 33 of title 5 is substituted for &ldquo;the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service&rdquo; for clarity and for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words &ldquo;relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (j), the words &ldquo;and to the Congress&rdquo; are omitted pursuant to section 3003 of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (31 U.S.C. 1113 note). See, also, page 199 of House Document No. 103&ndash;7.</p>
