I53(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 496; Pub. L. 94ÿ09546, ÿ1A1(1), Oct. 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2519; Pub. L. 107ÿ09296, title XVII, ÿ1A1704(a), Nov. 25, 2002, 116 Stat. 2314; Pub. L. 112ÿ09213, title II, ÿ1A217(1), Dec. 20, 2012, 126 Stat. 1555.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A1 (Jan. 28, 1915, ch. 20, ÿ1A1, 38 Stat. 800; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, ÿ1A5, 6(a), 55 Stat. 585).

I21Said section has been divided. Provisions relating to operation under the Navy in time of war are placed in sections 3 and 4 of this title, and the remainder is in this section.

I21This section continues the Coast Guard as a military service and branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times. By the act of July 11, 1941, 55 Stat. 585 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A1), the Coast Guard was constituted a branch of the land and naval forces of the United States at all times. This section therefore merely continues an existing agency and codifies existing law on the military status of the Coast Guard, substituting ``armed forces'' for ``land and naval forces'' because of the recent establishment of the Department of the Air Force as an ``armed force'' rather than as a part of the ``land and naval forces''. The Coast Guard is designated a service in the Treasury Department except when operating as a service in the Navy. This is a better definition of the status of the Coast Guard than one which defines it as a service under the Treasury Department in time of peace, because the President is authorized to place the Coast Guard under the Navy in time of emergency, which could be in time of peace.

I21This section contains a codification of functions. It sets forth in general language the primary responsibilities of the Coast Guard: enforcement of all Federal laws on waters to which they have application, safety of life and property at sea, aiding navigation, and readiness to function with the Navy. Having been created in 1915 by the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service, the Coast Guard has gradually been given additional duties and responsibilities, such as the assignment of law enforcement powers on the high seas and navigable waters in 1936, the transfer of the Lighthouse Service in 1939, and the transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation in 1942. Existing along with these other duties has been that of maintaining a state of readiness as a specialized service prepared for active participation with the Navy in time of war. These various interdependent functions of the Service have not been expressed collectively in any statute heretofore, but it is believed desirable to do so in this revision in order to have outlined in general terms in one section the broad scope of the functions of the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This section grants broad general powers concerning policy matters to the Secretary. Many of the powers are contained in existing law but some are enlarged and some additional powers are added as explained following.

I21Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A95 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). Said section has been divided. The provision authorizing the Secretary to man stations seems more appropriately given to the operational head of the Service, the Commandant, and for that reason is incorporated in section 93(c) of this title.

I21Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A28, 42 (Aug. 16, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, ÿ1A11, 44 Stat. 817). These sections were rewritten in order to broaden existing authority in regard to the training of Coast Guard personnel at schools of the other armed forces, thus approaching a practice of war time, and making for economy in the training of Service personnel; such training would be on a basis mutually satisfactory to the Secretaries involved.

I21Subsection (c) is based on R.S. 4242 and on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A29, 93, 94, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, ÿ1A2, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, ÿ1A4, 54 Stat. 247; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the construction and disposal of shore establishments of all types including aviation stations.

I21Subsection (d) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A55, 57, 69, 109, and in part on title 31, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A487, 720, (R.S. 2748, 3618, 3692; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, ÿ1A3, 20 Stat. 163; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601). This subsection broadens existing law in that it provides general legislative authority for the design, construction, acquisition by other means, and disposal of vessels.

I21Subsection (e) is new. It is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, ÿ1A602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, ÿ1A6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]) which provides for the exchange of vehicles, planes, and engines; similar authority in relation to vessels, is granted to the Secretary by this subsection and should prove advantageous to the Government.

I21Subsection (f) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A96 and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A729, 730, 731 (Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 130, ÿ1A1, 18 Stat. 372; Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 299, 35 Stat. 972; June 17, 1910, ch. 301, ÿ1A9, 36 Stat. 538; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 1018). This subsection broadens the power of the Secretary to receive as a gift or purchase sites for stations, to include the acquisition of land by any means provided it is for the purpose of executing duties and functions of the Coast Guard.

I21Subsection (g) is based in part on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A732 (Aug. 28, 1916, ch. 414, ÿ1A2, 39 Stat. 538; July 11, 1941, ch. 290, ÿ1A1, 55 Stat. 584) and grants authority to the Secretary to exchange interests in land as payment or part payment for other interests in land for the purpose of executing the duties and functions of the Coast Guard; this authority, on the basis of past experience, will prove advantageous to the Government.

I21Subsection (h) is new and merely insures that the Secretary may exercise any of the powers granted to the Commandant in this title.

I21Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A51, 131 (R.S. 2756, 2758) and insures that the Secretary may do anything necessary to carry out the purposes of this title.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This section grants powers to the Commandant concerning, in general, operations within the Service and the internal functioning of the Service. Many of the powers are contained in existing law, but some are enlarged, and some additional powers are added as explained following.

I21Subsection (a) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A53, and title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A471 (R.S. 1536). The authority to order vessels to cruise along the coasts should be in the operational head of the Service, and not in the President. This section is changed to cover adequately the necessary present day cruising and patrolling.

I21Subsection (b) is derived from R.S. 4242 and title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A29, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98a (R.S. 4245, 4249; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, ÿ1A2, 3, 22 Stat. 56; Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; Aug. 6, 1947, ch. 502, 61 Stat. 786; June 6, 1940, ch. 257, ÿ1A4, 54 Stat. 247), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the establishment, discontinuance, and change of Coast Guard shore establishments other than Coast Guard districts. This power must exist inherently in order for the Service to function efficiently.

I21Subsection (c) is derived from title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A54, 97, 112 (May 4, 1882, ch. 117, ÿ1A3, 22 Stat. 56; May 30, 1908, ch. 231, 35 Stat. 553; Apr. 21, 1910, ch. 182, ÿ1A2, 36 Stat. 326), and specifically grants to the Commandant authority in regard to the assignment of vessels, vehicles, aids to navigation, and other equipment. This power is inherent to the proper functioning of any Service.

I21Subsection (d) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A91 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, ÿ1A7, 20 Stat. 164; June 10, 1921, ch. 18, ÿ1A304, 42 Stat. 24; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, ÿ1A9, 44 Stat. 817). Said section has been divided. The part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in this subsection in broader terms, and the other parts are covered in general terms in section 632 of this title.

I21Subsection (e) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A111 (June 18, 1878, ch. 265, ÿ1A9, 20 Stat. 164). This section has been rewritten to broaden the authority to include any investigation or study that may be of assistance to the Coast Guard, the limitation as to investigation of shipwrecks having been eliminated.

I21Subsection (f) is new and is intended to give legislative recognition to the importance of disseminating information by the Coast Guard for the promotion of safety at sea, life-saving techniques, and other Coast Guard activities.

I21Subsection (g) is new and provides for the training of Coast Guard personnel at other than schools or institutions of the other armed forces. Such training is essential and has been carried on under the authority of appropriation acts for many years.

I21Subsection (h) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A69, 108, 109, (R.S. 2748; June 20, 1874, ch. 344, ÿ1A9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, ÿ1A3, 20 Stat. 163), and is intended to complement the authority granted to the Secretary in sec. 92(d) of this title granting similar authority to the Commandant as to smaller craft.

I21Subsection (i) is based in part on title 14, U.S.C., ÿ1A108, 109, and on title 33, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A752 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, ÿ1A9, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, ÿ1A3, 20 Stat. 163; Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 168, 37 Stat. 10183, and grants power to the Commandant to acquire and dispose of various equipment and supplies. The authority with respect to the acceptance of such equipment as a gift is new.

I21Subsection (j) is new and grants power to the Commandant to operate and maintain shore establishments; previously such authority has been inferred from statutes providing for the establishment of shore stations; again such authority is inherent to the functioning of any Service, and this section will provide no greater authority than has been exercised in the past.

I21Subsection (k) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A31b (June 6, 1941, ch. 177, 55 Stat. 247 [which was originally repealed by act June 30, 1949, ch. 288, title VI, ÿ1A602(a)(28), 63 Stat. 399, renumbered Sept. 5, 1950, ch. 849, ÿ1A6(a), (b), 64 Stat. 583]). The primary authority is granted to the Commandant as well as to the Secretary inasmuch as such exchange seems to be an operational matter and the items which may be exchanged have been enlarged by the addition of aids to navigation, appliances, equipment, and supplies.

I21Inasmuch as the act cited above applies to the Navy as well as the Coast Guard it is not scheduled for repeal but is being amended by section 13 of this act to eliminate reference to the Coast Guard.

I21Subsection (T3lK) is new and is deemed desirable in order to give legislative authority for existing yards, and for the procurement of needed equipment and material in case such is not normally or economically obtainable from private contractors.

I21Subsection (m) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A110, 192 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, ÿ1A6, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, ÿ1A10, 20 Stat. 165; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, ÿ1A9, 44 Stat. 817). The power to accept volunteer services is enlarged to include all services offered in time of emergency, to save life or protect property, and the restrictive provisions relating to lifeboat stations only have been eliminated.

I21Subsection (n) is new and grants authority to the Commandant to lease real property under the control of the Coast Guard, when not immediately needed in Coast Guard operations. Such authority will be advantageous to the Government, on the basis of past experience.

I21Subsection (T3oK) is new and is supplementary to subsection (n) of this section. It grants further authority to the Commandant permitting him to grant minor interests in land which is under control of the Coast Guard. This will avoid the necessity of special acts of Congress in each of such instances.

I21Subsection (p) is new and is necessary to give proper authority for the maintenance of networks of wires and cables, in some cases over or along private property or public highways. These networks are in existence at the present time and are essential for the Service to carry out its functions.

I21Subsection (q) is new and is necessary in order to provide clear authority for the maintenance of radio stations which are essential to Coast Guard functions.

I21Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21In connection with its maritime police, promoting safety of life and property at sea, and aiding navigation functions, the Coast Guard frequently finds it advisable to utilize the services of other agencies and correlatively, frequently finds its facilities useful to other agencies. This high degree of cooperation, a natural attribute of a producing and servicing agency, is important not only because it greatly promotes the quantity and quality of the services performed, but because the concentration of these functions in one agency results in savings to the Government of man-power, funds, and equipment. In the belief that legislative recognition of and specific power to continue this needed cooperation are desirable, Chapter 7 of this title contains a group of sections on cooperation with designated agencies. This is not meant to be a complete listing of cooperating agencies, but rather the designation of the principal ones. In addition, the first section of the chapter deals with availability of Coast Guard personnel and facilities to other agencies and the availability of other agency personnel and facilities to the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Because of the numerous situations in which it is necessary for the Coast Guard to deal with foreign governments, particularly in the field of safety of life and property at sea, the Coast Guard and the State Department agree that a provision such as this is desirable.

I21The international character of many Coast Guard functions makes it more and more necessary for the Service to be an initiating or participating agency in international collaboration. Examples of international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international telecommunications. It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road, safety requirements and equipment of transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels.

I21Subsection (a) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A28, 42, 57 (Aug. 29, 1916, ch. 417, 39 Stat. 601; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, ÿ1A11, 44 Stat. 817.) Subsection is enlarged to make reimbursement for the building of ships or the training of personnel dependent on agreement of the Secretaries, and to include all schools operated by the Navy, rather than aviation schools only.

I21Subsection (b) is based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A31 (Mar. 6, 1920, ch. 94, ÿ1A1, 41 Stat. 506).

I21Subsection (c) is new. This subsection enacts what has been the practice of the Navy and Coast Guard in keeping the Coast Guard trained to ``come on board with some muscle'' in time of emergency.

I21Section 3 of this title deals with the relationship of the Coast Guard to the Navy Department. This section deals with cooperation with the Navy. Whereas the status of the Coast Guard in time of war was treated in chapter 1 of this title, this section has application in time of peace when the Coast Guard is not under the Navy Department.

I11In order to promote the safety of life and property on and over the high seas and waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, and to facilitate the preparation and dissemination by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the weather reports, forecasts, and warnings essential to the safe and efficient conduct of domestic and international commerce on and over such seas and waters, the Commandant may cooperate with the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration by procuring, maintaining, and making available, facilities and assistance for observing, investigating, and communicating weather phenomena and for disseminating weather data, forecasts and warnings, the mutually satisfactory terms of such cooperation in weather service to be agreed upon and arranged between the Commandant and the Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This section outlines the sphere of cooperation between the Weather Bureau and the Coast Guard. It would not permit any cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.

I21Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the Weather Bureau, positive recognition of this has never appeared in the statutes. In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life saving activities, the Coast Guard finds it important to make, receive and transmit weather observations and measurements. Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting, particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work, assumed increasing importance, and this extensive weather station manning in cooperation with the Weather Bureau must be provided for in the postwar period. This section providing for such close cooperation with the Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the cooperative practices of the two agencies as they have operated for years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I74Amendments

I211982_Pub. L. 97ÿ09295 substituted ``Administration'' for ``Admministration'' after ``Atmospheric''.

I11(a) The Commandant may assist the Secretary of Health and Human Services in providing medical emergency helicopter transportation services to civilians. The Commandant may prescribe conditions, including reimbursement, under which resources may be provided under this section. The following specific limitations apply to assistance provided under this section:

I12(1) Assistance may be provided only in areas where Coast Guard units able to provide the assistance are regularly assigned. Coast Guard units may not be transferred from one area to another to provide the assistance.

I12(2) Assistance may be provided only to the extent it does not interfere with the performance of the Coast Guard mission.

I12(3) Providing assistance may not cause an increase in amounts required for the operation of the Coast Guard.

Q04

I11(b) An individual (or the estate of that individual) who is authorized by the Coast Guard to provide a service under a program established under subsection (a) and who is acting within the scope of that individual's duties is not liable for injury to, or loss of, property or personal injury or death that may be caused incident to providing the service.

I21Experience has indicated that it will be advantageous for the Government to include the Coast Guard along with the other armed forces for the purpose of detailing personnel for service with foreign governments.

I21It seems probable that the increased collaboration with foreign governments after the war and the vital nature of the Coast Guard's activities in relation to such collaboration will result in requests from time to time by foreign governments for assistance which the Coast Guard is in the best position to render. This section, which confers broad authority in the President to detail Coast Guard officers and enlisted men to assist foreign governments, is patterned after the act of October 1, 1942, 56 Stat. 763 (title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A441ÿ09a), which authorizes the President to detail Army, Navy, and Marine Corps officers and men to certain foreign governments and, in times of war or national emergency, to any foreign government in the interests of national defense. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I53(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 393, 63 Stat. 507.)

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Experience since the war has indicated the necessity for making provision for the assignment of Coast Guard officers to diplomatic missions in those foreign countries which are extensively engaged in maritime commerce with the United States. This is largely the result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant vessels.

I21This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the State Department, of Coast Guard officers to be officially attached to diplomatic missions of the United States. Although Coast Guard advice on Coast Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic missions, in those locations where such advice and information are frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization of Coast Guard services would be achieved by having Coast Guard officers attached to such missions. Provision for customs officers to be attached to diplomatic missions is contained in the act of March 4, 1923, as amended, 42 Stat. 1453 (title 19, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A6). Before the transfer in 1939 of the Foreign Agriculture Service to the State Department, representatives of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture stationed abroad were agricultural attacheÿAE1s.

I11(b) T4Orders and Agreements for Industrial ActivitiesK._Under this section, the Coast Guard industrial activities may accept orders from and enter into reimbursable agreements with establishments, agencies, and departments of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.

It makes statutory what has been administrative regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make the control of an institution of such national interest as the Academy the subject of a statute.

I21This section is new. There is no provision in existing law which establishes the Academy and sets it up as an operating unit. Nor is there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of the Academy, or prescribes his duties and functions. Heretofore this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which deal with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and assume the existence of the Superintendent with certain defined functions and duties. This section continues the Academy as previously established, provides for the appointment of the Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general terms his functions. The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory basis, and the office of Superintendent would be a statutory position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no way be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I11(a) The number of cadets appointed annually to the Academy shall be as determined by the Secretary but the number appointed in any one year shall not exceed six hundred. Appointments to cadetships shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, who shall determine age limits, methods of selection of applicants, term of service as a cadet before graduation, and all other matters affecting such appointments. In the administration of this chapter, the Secretary shall take such action as may be necessary and appropriate to insure that female individuals shall be eligible for appointment and admission to the Coast Guard Academy, and that the relevant standards required for appointment, admission, training, graduation, and commissioning of female individuals shall be the same as those required for male individuals, except for those minimum essential adjustments in such standards required because of physiological differences between male and female individuals. The Secretary may summarily dismiss from the Coast Guard any cadet who, during his cadetship, is found unsatisfactory in either studies or conduct, or may be deemed not adapted for a career in the Coast Guard. Cadets shall be subject to rules governing discipline prescribed by the Commandant.

I11(b) Each cadet shall sign an agreement with respect to the cadet's length of service in the Coast Guard. The agreement shall provide that the cadet agrees to the following:

I13(A) will accept an appointment, if tendered, as a commissioned officer of the Coast Guard; and

I13(B) will serve on active duty for at least five years immediately after such appointment.

Q04

I12(3) That if an appointment described in paragraph (2) is not tendered or if the cadet is permitted to resign as a regular officer before the completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet, the cadet_

I13(A) will accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve; and

I13(B) will remain in that reserve component until completion of the commissioned service obligation of the cadet.

Q04

I11(c)(1) The Secretary may transfer to the Coast Guard Reserve, and may order to active duty for such period of time as the Secretary prescribes (but not to exceed four years), a cadet who breaches an agreement under subsection (b). The period of time for which a cadet is ordered to active duty under this paragraph may be determined without regard to section 651(a) of title 10.

I11(2) A cadet who is transferred to the Coast Guard Reserve under paragraph (1) shall be transferred in an appropriate enlisted grade or rating, as determined by the Secretary.

I11(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a cadet shall be considered to have breached an agreement under subsection (b) if the cadet is separated from the Coast Guard Academy under circumstances which the Secretary determines constitute a breach by the cadet of the cadet's agreement to complete the course of instruction at the Coast Guard Academy and accept an appointment as a commissioned officer upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy.

I11(d) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Those regulations shall include_

I12(1) standards for determining what constitutes, for the purpose of subsection (c), a breach of an agreement under subsection (b);

I12(2) procedures for determining whether such a breach has occurred; and

I12(3) standards for determining the period of time for which a person may be ordered to serve on active duty under subsection (c).

Q04

I11(e) In this section, ``commissioned service obligation'', with respect to an officer who is a graduate of the Academy, means the period beginning on the date of the officer's appointment as a commissioned officer and ending on the sixth anniversary of such appointment or, at the discretion of the Secretary, any later date up to the eighth anniversary of such appointment.

I11(f)(1) This section does not apply to a cadet who is not a citizen or national of the United States.

I11(2) In the case of a cadet who is a minor and who has parents or a guardian, the cadet may sign the agreement required by subsection (b) only with the consent of the parent or guardian.

I11(g) A cadet or former cadet who does not fulfill the terms of the obligation to serve as specified under section (b), or the alternative obligation imposed under subsection (c), shall be subject to the repayment provisions of section 303a(e) of title 37.

I21The last sentence of this section is new, being included in order to allow for adjusting the working time and leave of civilian instructors in conformity with the academic terms at the Academy. The work load of an instructor varies greatly, and flexibility in administration of a faculty is therefore essential. The leave provided for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an instruction staff, and this has been a source of difficulty in the past. This new provision would permit leave during the summer and between academic terms without deduction from pay, and, it is contemplated, at no other time.

I21Section 15c of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., has been divided. The last sentence is incorporated in this section, while the other provisions are placed in section 189 of this title.

I21The composition of the teaching staff at the Academy is changed materially on the recommendation of the Academic Board and the Advisory Committee. The scope of duty of members of the staff is enlarged to include whatever the Commandant prescribes.

I21Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A15b provides for five professors as heads or assistant heads of departments at the Academy. The Academic Board of the Academy and the Advisory Committee, after extensive study have recommended the change, as provided in this section, to three professors and twelve others on the permanent teaching staff, with designations to conform generally with the designations and grades of faculty members at other universities. The librarian is given faculty status because of the role of the library as the center of the modern university; this is in conformity with the practice of other higher educational institutions. It is believed that the increased number of permanent commissioned instructors is justified and desirable in view of the expansion of the Cadet Corps as the full effect of the return to a four-year course is felt. It is probable that, in the next few years, the number of cadets will approximate 450. The average number in the past two years has been about 300. This new set-up for the permanent commissioned teaching staff will permit desirable exchanges of professors with leading universities, and occasional sabbatical leaves in order to better the faculty generally. It is pointed out that this increase in permanent instructors does not increase the authorized number of officers in the Coast Guard, as they are all included in the limitation provided in section 42 of this title. If a teaching position at the Academy is not provided for permanently it will require the assignment of an additional regular officer, so it is apparent that the changes proposed in this section do not increase the size of the Service, or the expense, but represent a long-range plan to better the Academy as a leading educational institution within the present, recognized, standards for a proper university faculty. The last sentence retains the command status of the professors as provided in existing law but enlarges the field in which they may perform duty, in order to make it possible to give them interim assignments other than at the Academy, thus broadening their knowledge of the Service while still advantageously utilizing their services. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

An original appointment to the permanent commissioned teaching staff, unless the appointee has served as a civilian member of the teaching staff, regular commissioned officer, temporary commissioned officer, or reserve commissioned officer in the Coast Guard, shall be a temporary appointment until the appointee has satisfactorily completed a probationary term of four years of service; thereafter he may be regularly appointed and his rank shall date from the date of his temporary appointment in the grade in which permanently appointed.

Authorization for appointment in any grade is deemed desirable in order to permit the acquisition of outstanding instructors for the staff.

I21The provision prohibiting the retirement of a professor because of physical disability with less than 15 years' service is changed to have application only during the temporary appointment of a professor.

I21This section provides for the retirement of associate professors, assistant professors, and commissioned instructors in addition to professors. It is believed that the provision of existing law requiring 15 years' service before becoming eligible for retirement, discriminated against this group of officers as no other group was discriminated against, and should be eliminated. It was changed so that these officers would be ineligible for retirement during their probationary term only.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This chapter, dealing with the appointment, enlistment, promotion, retirement and recall of all military personnel, covers subject matter which has been greatly affected by war-time legislation and, therefore, has required rather extensive rewriting of existing law in order to correlate all of the various provisions. An attempt has been made to provide for enlisted men and warrant officers in a manner similar to the way that commissioned officers are provided for; for example, the act of February 21, 1946, ch. 34, 60 Stat. 29 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A162a), made provision for the retirement of commissioned officers on half pay after twenty years naval service, and a prewar statute provided for twenty year retirement of enlisted men on half pay. This leaves warrant officers the only military group not eligible for retirement in twenty years, and a provision such as found in section 305 of this title, granting such retirement, seems clearly indicated in order to avoid unjust discrimination.

I21The subject matter seemed to break down into the sub-heads of ``Commissioned Officers'', ``Warrant Officers'', ``Enlisted Men'', and ``General Provisions''. Each of the first three sub-heads parallels the other two, insofar as the applicability of statutes of the three groups permits. The last sub-head includes the broad provisions which, in the same terms, can be made applicable to all military personnel. In accord with existing Navy and Coast Guard law, the term ``commissioned officer'' includes commissioned warrant officers unless specifically excepted, or manifestly inapplicable. Heretofore Coast Guard statutes have designated commissioned warrant officers as chief warrant officers; in line with Navy designation it is changed to commissioned warrant officers throughout this title. Terms such as ``Coast Guard personnel'' or ``personnel of the Coast Guard'', as used throughout this title, are intended to include all employees of the Service, civilian and military. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I21Certain additional details concerning the two types of enlistments are added; these details were previously covered in Coast Guard Regulations.

I21This section makes provision for the enlistment of personnel in the Coast Guard. The first sentence grants the necessary authority to the Secretary, changes existing law in regard to the term of enlistment from ``not to exceed four years'' to ``not to exceed six years'', and adds a provision for the enlistment of minors for their minority only, such provision being in accordance with existing law applicable to the Navy. The next three sentences establish and define the two types of enlistments that are now in effect in the Coast Guard, setting forth the basic difference in the two types. The last sentence continues a provision to the effect that original enlistments in the Coast Guard shall be temporary. This section is a combination of existing law and regulations in regard to enlistments, with changes as noted above. See title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A35, and Coast Guard Regulations, sections 531 and 532. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I11(a) Any person of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned as an officer in the Coast Guard shall be an extra number in his grade and in the grades to which he may be promoted. He shall take precedence (1) with other officers commissioned in his grade from the former Lighthouse Service as the Secretary of the Treasury may determine, and (2) with other line officers in his grade in accordance with the respective dates of their commissions in such grade. He shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, at such time as the officer in a regular number in line of promotion next above him on the seniority list becomes eligible for promotion; or if there be no such officer in his grade, he shall be eligible for promotion, if otherwise qualified, when a vacancy occurs in the next higher grade. An officer so commissioned shall be assigned to duty for which he is specially qualified, and professional examinations for promotion given to such officer shall embrace only subjects which pertain to the duty to which he is assigned.

I11(b) Each vacancy (1) hereafter occurring in the extra numbers of such officers; (2) existing on August 5, 1939, in positions in the Lighthouse Service formerly held by personnel eligible for such commissions; and (3) created by the retirement, resignation, death, or separation from the service for any other cause, of such personnel who do not possess the qualifications prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or who, being qualified, do not accept a commission thereunder, shall operate to increase by one the total authorized number of line officers of the Coast Guard.

I11(c) All persons of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall be subject to all laws and regulations for the government of the Coast Guard, and nothing contained in this title shall be construed to prevent the application to any of such persons of laws and regulations concerning the military discipline of commissioned and warrant officers and enlisted members of the Coast Guard.

I11(d) In computing length of service, for the purpose of retirement in the Coast Guard, of any person of the former Lighthouse Service commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard, there shall be included all service computable for retirement under the provisions of section 763 of title 33; and after July 1, 1948, in computing longevity for the purpose of pay of such person there shall be included all service of such person in the Lighthouse Service.

I11(e) No person so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted in the Coast Guard shall suffer any reduction in the total of the annual compensation and allowances which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment. Upon his retirement from active duty in the Coast Guard, the retired pay of any person so commissioned, appointed, or enlisted, shall not be less than an annuity computed in accordance with the provisions of section 763 of title 33, substituting, however, for purposes of such computation, the annual compensation which he was receiving on the date of his commission, appointment, or enlistment in the Coast Guard for the average annual pay received by him for the last five years of service.

I11(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, chapter 51, subchapter III of chapter 53, and sections 5542ÿ095546 of title 5 shall not apply to civilian keepers of lighthouses and to civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard.

I11(g)(1) The head of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating under regulations prescribed by him, may regulate the hours of duty and the pay of civilian keepers of lighthouses and civilians employed on lightships and other vessels of the Coast Guard, but such personnel may be called upon for duty in emergency circumstances or otherwise at any time or all times. The existing system governing the pay of such employees may be continued or changed except that overtime compensation, night differential, and extra pay for duty on holidays shall not be paid to such employees. In lieu thereof additional annual compensation may be authorized, which may be prescribed either as a fixed differential or as a percentage of the basic compensation otherwise applicable to such employees. In no case shall basic compensation exceed $15,000 per annum, except that nothing contained in this subsection shall operate to decrease the basic compensation of any person employed by the Coast Guard on the date of enactment of this subsection, and in no case shall additions thereto exceed 25 percent of such basic compensation. Provision may be made for compensatory absence from duty when conditions of employment result in confinement because of isolation or in long periods of continuous duty; and provisions may likewise be made for extra allowance for service outside of the continental limits of the United States.

I11(2) The additional compensation authorized by this subsection shall be included in any computation of compensation under section 6 of the Act of June 20, 1918 (33 U.S.C. 763).

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A20a, 121 (May 18, 1920, ch. 190, ÿ1A8, 41 Stat. 603; June 10, 1922, ch. 212, 42 Stat. 625; July 3, 1926, ch. 742, ÿ1A10, 44 Stat. 817).

I21Said section 121 was omitted from the 1940 and 1946 editions of the U.S. Code, but it has been held that the assimilation provision thereof is inoperative only insofar as Congress has made specific legislative provision for the Coast Guard, and that benefits derived from legislation pertaining to the Navy previously conferred upon the Coast Guard, and not provided for in subsequent legislation, survive to the Coast Guard under the assimilation statute. (See 27 Comp. Dec. 234; 22 Comp. Gen. 723; decision of June 9, 1947, Bÿ0963472; decision of April 2, 1948, Bÿ0970438; and decision of September 2, 1948, Bÿ0977295.)

I21It seems desirable to retain this assimilation provision as to pay in order to cover any failure to provide specifically for the Coast Guard in military pay legislation.

I21This section assimilates the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard to the pay of military personnel of the Navy. It seems that this is the most feasible method of insuring that the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard will not vary from the pay of military personnel of the other armed forces. The assimilation is intended to include authorization for extra pay and allowances as provided for personnel of the Navy, for all types of special duty: for example, qualified divers on diving duty, military personnel assigned to submarine duty, military personnel assigned to aviation duty, officers assigned as aides to flag officers, and enlisted persons assigned to duty in the mess detail. Military pay acts are intended to include Coast Guard personnel specifically; this section would cover any failure to so provide for Coast Guard personnel in a pay act.

I21Changes were made in phraseology. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I74Amendments

I211976_Pub. L. 94ÿ09546 substituted ``Secretary'' for ``Secretary of the Treasury''.

I211966_Pub. L. 89ÿ09718, ÿ1A73(a)(3), amended section 14d of Pub. L. 87ÿ09649, which contained in cls. (1) to (6) list of sections of Title 14 repealed by Pub. L. 87ÿ09649, by inserting ``(7) Section 471(a) and (b).'' However, for purposes of codification, the repeal has been executed to former subsecs. (a) and (b) of this section, which provided respectively for the awarding of the same pay and allowances as prescribed for corresponding ranks, grades, or ratings for personnel of the Navy and for the withholding of pay of officers on account of indebtedness to the United States, since this appears to have been the intent of Congress.

I21Pub. L. 89ÿ09718, ÿ1A73(c)(1), struck out references to pay and allowances and pay of officers indebted to the United States from section catchline and struck out letter designation ``(c)'' from beginning of former subsec.

I89. Leasing and hiring of quarters; rental of inadequate housing

I11(a) The Secretary is authorized to lease housing facilities at or near Coast Guard installations, wherever located, for assignment as public quarters to military personnel and their dependents, if any, without rental charge upon a determination by the Secretary, or his designee, that there is a lack of adequate housing facilities at or near such Coast Guard installations. The Secretary is also authorized to lease housing facilities for assignment as public quarters, without rental charge, to military personnel who are on sea duty or duty at remote offshore Coast Guard stations and who do not have dependents. Such authority shall be effective in any fiscal year only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts. When any such lease involves housing facilities in a foreign country, the lease may be made on a multiyear basis for a period not to exceed five years, and, in accordance with local custom and practice, advance payment may be made for the lease. Such public housing facilities may be leased on an individual or multiple-unit basis. Expenditures for the rental of such housing facilities may not exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense in any year except where the Secretary finds that the average is so low as to prevent rental of necessary housing facilities in some areas, in which event he is authorized to reallocate existing funds to high-cost areas so that rental expenditures in such areas exceed the average authorized for the Department of Defense.

I11(b) The Secretary is authorized, subject to regulations approved by the President_

I12(1) to designate as rental housing such housing as he may determine to be inadequate as public quarters; and

Such accommodations shall not be available for occupancy by the dependents of such personnel.

I12(1) if such rescue or attempted rescue is made at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold;

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21Based on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A193, 194, 195, 196 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, ÿ1A7, 18 Stat. 127; June 18, 1878, ch. 265, ÿ1A12, 20 Stat. 165; May 4, 1882, ch. 117, ÿ1A9, 22 Stat. 57; Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 83, 29 Stat. 494).

I21Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of Life-saving medals turn on whether or not the United States has an interest in the heroic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional grounds. Under existing law the award of a medal could be made in any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen of the United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United States regardless of where the rescue took place; and if the rescue took place within waters of the United States the award could be made to an alien.

I21The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., ÿ1A192ÿ09196, has long needed revision. The existing law is composed of a series of statutes enacted separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result has not been entirely unsatisfactory. The original statute, enacted in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A193), provided for Life-saving medals of the first and second class to be bestowed ``upon any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel''. The medal of the first class was confined to cases of ``extreme and heroic daring'' and the medal of the second class was to be awarded ``in cases not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class'' Then in 1878 another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second class ``upon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked, and saving persons from drowning'' as, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition. These two sections were construed by the Attorney General to be limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to the perils of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of any lifeboat station, life-saving station, or house of refuge. And the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to members of life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att. Gen. 124. Thereupon, in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the two earlier acts should ``be construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to bestow such medals upon persons making signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, whether the said persons making such exertions were or were not members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions were made in the vicinity of a life-saving station''. (Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A196.) This act was designed to give a more liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 78. However, difficult questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different jurisdictional language in the three acts. For example, title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A193, refers to rescues ``within the United States'', while title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A196, refers to rescues ``in the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction''. The need for clarification is obvious. Subsection (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person, including Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any person from drowning, shipwreck, or peril of the water. If the rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one's own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold, and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded are defined simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional limitations. The difficulty with the existing law is the attempt to define the required deed together with those limitations. Subsection (a) does not change existing law insofar as the type of act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and clarifies existing law.

I21Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the awarding of the medal and broadens, to a considerable extent, the provisions of existing law. It is the intent of this subsection to authorize the awarding of a medal in all cases where the United States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts, such as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a United States citizen is rescued, or where United States waters or United States vessels or aircraft are involved. Accordingly, rescues by United States citizens anywhere in the world will be recognized. Any person, including persons not citizens of the United States, may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place in waters within the United States or subject to its jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either the rescuer or the person rescued is from a United States vessel or aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen. Thus, every case in which the United States government has an interest is provided for. A United States citizen who performs a heroic act sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign waters, could not receive one under existing law, but could receive such award under this proposed revision. The awarding of medals should not turn on technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble and heroic acts.

I21Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A195, except that authority is granted to award medals posthumously. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

I21Said section 91 has been divided. That part dealing with investigation of plans and inventions is covered in section 93(d) of this title. The remainder is covered in general terms. It has been rewritten in broad terms, making clear that the Commandant is granted the necessary authority to administer the Coast Guard under the Secretary, including authority to issue rules, orders, and instructions.

I21This section is primarily a consolidation of existing functions rather than a codification of existing laws. It does not, for the most part, grant new authority to the Coast Guard as an organization. It merely clarifies the method by which Coast Guard functions shall be administered. Under existing statutes, functions relating to the Coast Guard have been conferred upon the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commandant, and sometimes upon the Secretary of the Treasury in times of peace and the Secretary of the Navy in times of war. This revision confers some functions directly upon the Coast Guard, and this section provides for the execution of those functions by the Commandant, the military head of the organization, thereby making for consistency and uniformity. The functions are to be executed ``subject to the general supervision of the Secretary''. Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A91 now grants authority to the Commandant to prescribe regulations; this is changed to the issuance of rules, orders, and instructions as the promulgation of regulations in a military organization is properly a function of the Secretary.

I21This section closely parallels title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A600a, 600b, which authorize the Secretary of the Navy to negotiate amicable settlements of affirmative claims of the United States for damage to Government property. Experience gained by the Navy since enactment of title 34, U.S.C., 1946 ed., ÿ1A600aÿ09600d, indicates that such amicable settlement reacts to the benefit of the Government in many cases. The provisions of this section would complement those of section 646 of this title and the two sections together would permit the Coast Guard to negotiate the settlement of claims arising out of Coast Guard floating operations, both for and against the United States. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

Any orders placed for such industrial work shall be covered by a transfer or advance of funds to cover the estimated cost thereof, and shall be credited to such accounts as may be necessary and established by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this section. Accounts so established shall be available for materials, supplies, or equipment, and civilian labor, including overhead and maintenance, required in performing the work ordered. Upon completion of an order an adjustment will be made to make the amount transferred or advanced equal to the actual cost as computed in accordance with the accounting regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

I11(a) A Coast Guard Supply Fund is authorized. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for designating the classification of materials to be stocked. In these regulations, whenever the fund is extended to include items not previously stocked, or spare parts obtained as part of a procurement under a different account of major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts were previously stocked, the Secretary may authorize an increase in the existing capital of the fund by the value of such usable materials transferred thereto from Coast Guard inventories carried in other accounts. Except for the materials so transferred, the fund shall be charged with the cost of materials purchased or otherwise acquired. The fund shall be credited with the value of materials consumed, issued for use, sold, or otherwise disposed of, such values to be determined on a basis that will approximately cover the cost thereof.

I11(b) Obligations may, without regard to fiscal year limitations, be incurred against anticipated reimbursement to the Coast Guard Supply Fund in such amount and for such period, as the Secretary, with approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may determine to be necessary to maintain stock levels consistently with planned operations for the next year.

I11Any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy, including, but not limited to, restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel, shall, in the same manner and to the same extent, remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard.

I74Historical and Revision Notes

I21This section is new and provides that any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy shall operate in the same manner to remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard. Included are restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel. This provision is designed to enable the Coast Guard to operate as efficiently as the Navy Department in time of war or during a national emergency and would permit the Coast Guard more effectively to maintain itself in a state of military readiness during periods of emergency. Since the Coast Guard operates as part of the Navy in time of war, it is essential that its operations be as flexible and as efficient as those of the Department of which it is to be a part. This section would prevent inadvertent failures specifically to mention the Coast Guard in legislation of the type described in this section from hindering service operations. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.

That law shall be administered by the Secretary of Labor to the same extent as if the member was a civil employee of the United States and was injured in the performance of that duty. For benefit computation, regardless of pay or pay status, the member is considered to have had monthly pay of the monthly equivalent of the minimum rate of basic pay in effect for grade GSÿ099 of the General Schedule on the date the injury is incurred.

I11(b) This section does not apply if the workmen's compensation law of a State, a territory, or another jurisdiction provides coverage because of a concurrent employment status of the temporary member. When the temporary member or a dependent is entitled to a benefit under this section and also to a concurrent benefit from the United States on account of the same disability or death, the temporary member or dependent, as appropriate, shall elect which benefit to receive.

I11(c) If a claim is filed under this section with the Secretary of Labor for benefits because of an alleged injury or death, the Secretary of Labor shall notify the Commandant who shall direct an investigation into the facts surrounding the alleged injury or death. The Commandant shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the injured or deceased person was a temporary member of the Reserve, the person's military status, and whether or not the injury or death was incurred incident to military service.

I11(d) A temporary member of the Reserve, who incurs a physical disability or contracts sickness or disease while performing a duty to which the member has been assigned by competent authority, is entitled to the same hospital treatment afforded a member of the Regular Coast Guard.

I11(e) In administering section 8133 of title 5, for a person covered by this section_

I12(1) the percentages applicable to payments under that section are_

I13(A) 45 percent under subsection (a)(2) of that section, where the member died fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.), with no additional payments for a child or children so long as the widow or widower remains eligible for payments under that subsection;

I13(B) 20 percent under subsection (a)(3) of that section, for one child, and 10 percent additional for each additional child, not to exceed a total of 75 percent, where the member died fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act; and

I13(C) 25 percent under subsection (a)(4) of that section, if one parent was wholly dependent for support upon the deceased member at the time of the member's death and the other was not dependent to any extent; 16 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; and if one was, or both were, partly dependent, a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor;

Q04

I12(2) payments may not be made under subsection (a)(5) of that section; and

I12(3) the Secretary of Labor shall inform the Commissioner of Social Security whenever a claim is filed and eligibility for compensation is established under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of section 8133 of title 5. The Commissioner of Social Security shall then certify to the Secretary of Labor whether or not the member concerned was fully or currently insured under title II of the Social Security Act at the time of the member's death.

I12(1) a baccalaureate degree in not more than 5 academic years; or

I12(2) a post-baccalaureate degree.

Q04

I11(b)(1) To be eligible for financial assistance under this section, an enlisted member of the Coast Guard Reserve shall_

I12(A) be enrolled on a full-time basis in a program of education referred to in subsection (a) at any institution of higher education; and

I12(B) enter into a written agreement with the Coast Guard described in paragraph (2).

Q04

I12(A) to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer in the Coast Guard Reserve, if tendered;

I12(B) to serve on active duty for up to five years; and

I12(C) under such terms and conditions as shall be prescribed by the Secretary, to serve in the Coast Guard Reserve until the eighth anniversary of the date of the appointment.

I11(a) The authorized number of officers in the Reserve in an active status is 5,000. Reserve officers on an active-duty list shall not be counted as part of the authorized number of officers in the Reserve. The actual number of Reserve officers in an active status at any time shall not exceed the authorized number unless the Secretary determines that a greater number is necessary for planned mobilization requirements, or unless the excess results directly from the operation of law.

I11(b)(1) The Secretary shall make, at least once each year, a computation to determine the number of Reserve officers in an active status authorized to be serving in each grade. The number in each grade shall be computed by applying the applicable percentage to the total number of such officers serving in an active status on the date the computation is made. The number of Reserve officers in an active status below the grade of rear admiral (lower half) shall be distributed by pay grade so as not to exceed percentages of commissioned officers authorized by section 42(b) of this title. When the actual number of Reserve officers in an active status in a particular pay grade is less than the maximum percentage authorized, the difference may be applied to the number in the next lower grade. A Reserve officer may not be reduced in rank or grade solely because of a reduction in an authorized number as provided for in this subsection, or because an excess results directly from the operation of law.

I11(2) The authorized number of Reserve Officers in an active status not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral is a total of two. However, the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may authorize an additional number of Reserve officers not on active duty in the grades of rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral as necessary in order to meet planned mobilization requirements.

I12(2) those officers serving in the grade of ensign whom it considers to be fully qualified.

Q04

I11(d)(1) Before convening a selection board to recommend Reserve officers for promotion, the Secretary shall establish a promotion zone for officers serving in each grade to be considered by the board.
