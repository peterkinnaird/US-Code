I21Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 20, 2010, 75 F.R. 3979, provided:

I21Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

I21The Federal Government pays more than half a trillion dollars a year to contractors and has an important obligation to protect American taxpayer money and the integrity of the Federal acquisition process. Yet reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) state that Federal contracts are awarded to tens of thousands of companies with serious tax delinquencies. The total amount in unpaid taxes owed by these contracting companies is estimated to be more than $5 billion.

I21Too often, Federal contracting officials do not have the most basic information they need to make informed judgments about whether a company trying to win a Federal contract is delinquent in paying its taxes. We need to give our contracting officials the tools they need to protect taxpayer dollars.

I21Accordingly, I hereby direct the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) to direct a review of certifications of non-delinquency in taxes that companies bidding for Federal contracts are required to submit pursuant to a 2008 amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. I further direct that the Commissioner report to me within 90 days on the overall accuracy of contractors' certifications.

I86Streamlining Procurement Through Electronic Commerce

I21Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58 F.R. 58095, provided:

I21Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President's Management Council

I21The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity. Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness. The electronic exchange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.

I21T21. OBJECTIVES.

I21The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:

I21(a) exchange procurement information_such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents_electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;

I21(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;

I21(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;

I21(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and

I21(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.

I21T22. IMPLEMENTATION.

I21The President's Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:

I21(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;

I21(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;

I21(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and

I21(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.

I21This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.

I21The head of each executive department or agency shall:

I21(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;

I21(b) assist the President's Management Council in implementing the electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules established herein; and

I21(c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President's Management Council and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each respective department or agency.

I21T23. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.

I21This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

I21The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

I21Ex. Ord. No. 13005, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26069, provided:

I21In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, it is necessary to secure broad-based competition for Federal contracts. This broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of producing quality goods and services at competitive prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation's economically distressed communities.

I21Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those communities. Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to qualified businesses.

I21Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 486(a) [now 121(a)] of title 40, United States Code, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3PolicyK. The purpose of this order is to strengthen the economy and to improve the efficiency of the Federal procurement system by encouraging business development that expands the industrial base and increases competition.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3Empowerment Contracting ProgramK. In consultation with the Secretaries of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Defense; the Administrator of General Services; the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Administrator of the Small Business Administration; and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall develop policies and procedures to ensure that agencies, to the extent permitted by law, grant qualified large businesses and qualified small businesses appropriate incentives to encourage business activity in areas of general economic distress, including a price or an evaluation credit, when assessing offers for government contracts in unrestricted competitions, where the incentives would promote the policy set forth in this order. In developing such policies and procedures, the Secretary shall consider the size of the qualified businesses.

I21T4SecK. 3. T3Monitoring and EvaluationK. The Secretary shall:

I21(a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order;

I21(b) develop a process to ensure the proper administration of the program and to reduce the potential for fraud by the intended beneficiaries of the program;

I21(c) develop principles and a process to evaluate the effectiveness of the policies and procedures developed in accordance with this order; and

I21(d) by December 1 of each year, issue a report to the President on the status and effectiveness of the program.

I21T4SecK. 4. T3Implementation GuidelinesK. In implementing this order, the Secretary shall:

I21(a) issue rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement this order, including a requirement for the periodic review of the eligibility of qualified businesses and distressed areas;

I21(b) draft all rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to implement this order within 90 days of the date of this order; and

I21(c) ensure that all policies and procedures and all rules, regulations, and guidelines adopted and implemented in accordance with this order minimize the administrative burden on affected agencies and the procurement process.

I21T4SecK. 5. T3DefinitionsK. For purposes of this Executive order:

I21(a) ``Agency'' means any authority of the United States that is an ``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).

I21(b) ``Area of general economic distress'' shall be defined, for all urban and rural communities, as any census tract that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or any designated Federal Empowerment Zone, Supplemental Empowerment Zone, Enhanced Enterprise Community, or Enterprise Community. In addition, the Secretary may designate as an area of general economic distress any additional rural or Indian reservation area after considering the following factors:

I21(1) Unemployment rate;

I21(2) Degree of poverty;

I21(3) Extent of outmigration; and

I21(4) Rate of business formation and rate of business growth.

I21(c) ``Qualified large business'' means a large for-profit or not-for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number of residents from the area of general economic distress; and (2) either has a significant physical presence in the area of general economic distress or has a direct impact on generating significant economic activity in the area of general economic distress.

I21(d) ``Qualified small business'' means a small for-profit or not-for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number of residents from the area of general economic distress; (2) has a significant physical presence in the area of general economic distress; or (3) has a direct impact on generating significant economic activity in the area of general economic distress.

I21(e) ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Commerce.

I21T4SecK. 6. T3Agency AuthorityK. Nothing in this Executive order shall be construed as displacing the agencies' authority or responsibilities, as authorized by law, including specifically other programs designed to promote the development of small or disadvantaged businesses.

I21T4SecK. 7. T3Judicial ReviewK. This Executive order does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

I86Ex. Ord. No. T113627K. Strengthening Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal Contracts

I21Ex. Ord. No. 13627, Sept. 25, 2012, 77 F.R. 60029, provided:

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended (TVPA) (Public Law 106ÿ09386, Division A), and in order to strengthen protections against trafficking in persons in Federal contracting, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3PolicyK. More than 20 million men, women, and children throughout the world are victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons (``trafficking'' or ``trafficking in persons'')_defined in section 103 of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7102(8) [now (9)], to include sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age, or the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.

I21The United States has long had a zero-tolerance policy regarding Government employees and contractor personnel engaging in any form of this criminal behavior. As the largest single purchaser of goods and services in the world, the United States Government bears a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not contribute to trafficking in persons. By providing our Government workforce with additional tools and training to apply and enforce existing policy, and by providing additional clarity to Government contractors and subcontractors on the steps necessary to fully comply with that policy, this order will help to protect vulnerable individuals as contractors and subcontractors perform vital services and manufacture the goods procured by the United States.

I21In addition, the improved safeguards provided by this order to strengthen compliance with anti-trafficking laws will promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. These safeguards, which have been largely modeled on successful practices in the private sector, will increase stability, productivity, and certainty in Federal contracting by avoiding the disruption and disarray caused by the use of trafficked labor and resulting investigative and enforcement actions.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3Anti-Trafficking ProvisionsK. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, and the heads of such other executive departments and agencies (agencies) as the FAR Council determines to be appropriate, shall take steps necessary to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to:

I21(1) strengthen the efficacy of the Government's zero-tolerance policy on trafficking in persons by Federal contractors and subcontractors in solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts for supplies or services (including construction and commercial items), by:

I21(A) expressly prohibiting Federal contractors, contractor employees, subcontractors, and subcontractor employees from engaging in any of the following types of trafficking-related activities:

I22(i) using misleading or fraudulent recruitment practices during the recruitment of employees, such as failing to disclose basic information or making material misrepresentations regarding the key terms and conditions of employment, including wages and fringe benefits, the location of work, living conditions and housing (if employer provided or arranged), any significant costs to be charged to the employee, and, if applicable, the hazardous nature of the work;

I22(ii) charging employees recruitment fees;

I22(iii) destroying, concealing, confiscating, or otherwise denying access by an employee to the employee's identity documents, such as passports or drivers' licenses; and

I22(iv) for portions of contracts and subcontracts:

I22(I) performed outside the United States, failing to pay return transportation costs upon the end of employment, for an employee who is not a national of the country in which the work is taking place and who was brought into that country for the purpose of working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract;

I22(II) not covered by subsection (a)(1)(A)(iv)(I) of this section, failing to pay return transportation costs upon the end of employment, for an employee who is not a national of the country in which the work is taking place and who was brought into that country for the purpose of working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract, if the payment of such costs is required under existing temporary worker programs or pursuant to a written agreement with the employee; provided, however

I22(III) that the requirements of subsections (a)(1)(A)(iv)(I) and (II) shall not apply to:

I23(aa) an employee who is legally permitted to remain in the country of employment and who chooses to do so; or

I23(bb) an employee who is a victim of trafficking and is seeking victim services or legal redress in the country of employment, or an employee who is a witness in a trafficking-related enforcement action;

I22(v) other specific activities that the FAR Council identifies as directly supporting or promoting trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor in the performance of the contract or subcontract;

I21(B) requiring contractors and their subcontractors, by contract clause, to agree to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to allow contracting agencies and other responsible enforcement agencies to conduct audits, investigations, or other actions to ascertain compliance with the TVPA, this order, or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor; and

I21(C) requiring contracting officers to notify, in accordance with agency procedures, the agency's Inspector General, the agency official responsible for initiating suspension or debarment actions, and law enforcement, if appropriate, if they become aware of any activities that would justify termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7104(g), or are inconsistent with the requirements of this order or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor, and further requiring that the agency official responsible for initiating suspension and debarment actions consider whether suspension or debarment is necessary in order to protect the Government's interest;

I21(2) except as provided in subsection (a)(3) of this section, ensure that provisions in solicitations and clauses in contracts and subcontracts, where the estimated value of the supplies acquired or services required to be performed outside the United States exceeds $500,000, include the following requirements pertaining to the portion of the contract or subcontract performed outside the United States:

I21(A) that each such contractor and subcontractor maintain a compliance plan during the performance of the contract or subcontract that is appropriate for the size and complexity of the contract or subcontract and the nature and scope of the activities performed, including the risk that the contract or subcontract will involve services or supplies susceptible to trafficking. The compliance plan shall be provided to the contracting officer upon request, and relevant contents of the plan shall be posted no later than the initiation of contract performance at the workplace and on the contractor or subcontractor's Web site (if one is maintained), and shall, at a minimum, include:

I22(i) an awareness program to inform employees about:

I22(I) the policy of ensuring that employees do not engage in trafficking in persons or related activities, including those specified in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor; and

I22(II) the actions that will be taken against employees for violation of such policy;

I22(ii) a process for employees to report, without fear of retaliation, any activity that would justify termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA, or is inconsistent with the requirements of this order, or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor;

I22(iii) a recruitment and wage plan that only permits the use of recruitment companies with trained employees, prohibits charging recruitment fees to the employee, and ensures that wages meet applicable host country legal requirements or explains any variance;

I22(iv) a housing plan, if the contractor or subcontractor intends to provide or arrange housing, that ensures that the housing meets host country housing and safety standards or explains any variance; and

I22(v) procedures to prevent subcontractors at any tier from engaging in trafficking in persons, including those trafficking-related activities described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, and to monitor, detect, and terminate any subcontractors or subcontractor employees that have engaged in such activities; and

I21(B) that each such contractor and subcontractor shall certify, prior to receiving an award and annually thereafter during the term of the contract or subcontract, that:

I22(i) it has the compliance plan referred to in subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section in place to prevent trafficking-related activities described in section 106(g) of the TVPA and this order; and

I22(ii) either, to the best of its knowledge and belief, neither it nor any of its subcontractors has engaged in any such activities; or, if abuses have been found, the contractor or subcontractor has taken the appropriate remedial and referral actions;

I21(3) specify that the requirements in subsections (a)(2)(A) and (B) of this section shall not apply with respect to contracts or subcontracts for commercially available off-the-shelf items.

I21(b) Not later than 1 year after the date of this order, the member agencies of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF), established pursuant to section 105 of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7103, shall jointly establish a process for evaluating and identifying, for Federal contracts and subcontracts performed substantially within the United States, whether there are industries or sectors with a history (or where there is current evidence) of trafficking-related or forced labor activities described in section 106(g) of the TVPA, in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor. Where the PITF has identified such industries or sectors, it shall notify agencies of these designations, and individual agencies shall, in consultation with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, adopt and publish appropriate safeguards, guidance, and compliance assistance to prevent trafficking and forced labor in Federal contracting in these identified areas.

I21T4SecK. 3. T3Guidance and TrainingK. (a) The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall:

I21(1) in consultation with appropriate management councils, such as the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, provide guidance to agencies on developing appropriate internal procedures and controls for awarding and administering Federal contracts to improve monitoring of and compliance with actions to prevent trafficking in persons, consistent with section 106 of the TVPA, including the development of methods to track the number of trafficking violations reported and remedies applied; and

I21(2) in consultation with the Federal Acquisition Institute and appropriate management councils, such as the Chief Acquisition Officers Council:

I21(A) develop methods to track the number of Federal employees trained; and

I22(ii) internal controls and oversight procedures implemented by the agency, including enforcement procedures available to the agency to investigate, manage, and mitigate contractor and subcontractor trafficking violations.

I21(b) The member agencies of PITF shall jointly facilitate the sharing of information that may be used by acquisition, program, and other offices within agencies to evaluate where the risk of trafficking in persons may be heightened based on the nature of the work to be performed, the place of performance, and any other relevant considerations.

I86Government Contracting

I21Memorandum of President of the United States, Mar. 4, 2009, 74 F.R. 9755, provided:

I21Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

I21The Federal Government has an overriding obligation to American taxpayers. It should perform its functions efficiently and effectively while ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the taxpayers.

I21Since 2001, spending on Government contracts has more than doubled, reaching over $500 billion in 2008. During this same period, there has been a significant increase in the dollars awarded without full and open competition and an increase in the dollars obligated through cost-reimbursement contracts. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, for example, dollars obligated under cost-reimbursement contracts nearly doubled, from $71 billion in 2000 to $135 billion in 2008. Reversing these trends away from full and open competition and toward cost-reimbursement contracts could result in savings of billions of dollars each year for the American taxpayer.

I21Excessive reliance by executive agencies on sole-source contracts (or contracts with a limited number of sources) and cost-reimbursement contracts creates a risk that taxpayer funds will be spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the needs of the Federal Government or the interests of the American taxpayer. Reports by agency Inspectors General, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and other independent reviewing bodies have shown that noncompetitive and cost-reimbursement contracts have been misused, resulting in wasted taxpayer resources, poor contractor performance, and inadequate accountability for results.

I21When awarding Government contracts, the Federal Government must strive for an open and competitive process. However, executive agencies must have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out their missions and achieve the policy goals of the Government. In certain exigent circumstances, agencies may need to consider whether a competitive process will not accomplish the agency's mission. In such cases, the agency must ensure that the risks associated with noncompetitive contracts are minimized.

I21Moreover, it is essential that the Federal Government have the capacity to carry out robust and thorough management and oversight of its contracts in order to achieve programmatic goals, avoid significant overcharges, and curb wasteful spending. A GAO study last year of 95 major defense acquisitions projects found cost overruns of 26 percent, totaling $295 billion over the life of the projects. Improved contract oversight could reduce such sums significantly.

I21Government outsourcing for services also raises special concerns. For decades, the Federal Government has relied on the private sector for necessary commercial services used by the Government, such as transportation, food, and maintenance. Office of Management and Budget Circular Aÿ0976, first issued in 1966, was based on the reasonable premise that while inherently governmental activities should be performed by Government employees, taxpayers may receive more value for their dollars if non-inherently governmental activities that can be provided commercially are subject to the forces of competition.

I21However, the line between inherently governmental activities that should not be outsourced and commercial activities that may be subject to private sector competition has been blurred and inadequately defined. As a result, contractors may be performing inherently governmental functions. Agencies and departments must operate under clear rules prescribing when outsourcing is and is not appropriate.

I21It is the policy of the Federal Government that executive agencies shall not engage in noncompetitive contracts except in those circumstances where their use can be fully justified and where appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect the taxpayer. In addition, there shall be a preference for fixed-price type contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts shall be used only when circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract. Moreover, the Federal Government shall ensure that taxpayer dollars are not spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the Federal Government's needs and to manage the risk associated with the goods and services being procured. The Federal Government must have sufficient capacity to manage and oversee the contracting process from start to finish, so as to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent wisely and are not subject to excessive risk. Finally, the Federal Government must ensure that those functions that are inherently governmental in nature are performed by executive agencies and are not outsourced.

I21I hereby direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator of General Services, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the heads of such other agencies as the Director of OMB determines to be appropriate, and with the participation of appropriate management councils and program management officials, to develop and issue by July 1, 2009, Government-wide guidance to assist agencies in reviewing, and creating processes for ongoing review of, existing contracts in order to identify contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, or not otherwise likely to meet the agency's needs, and to formulate appropriate corrective action in a timely manner. Such corrective action may include modifying or canceling such contracts in a manner and to the extent consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and policy.

I21I further direct the Director of OMB, in collaboration with the aforementioned officials and councils, and with input from the public, to develop and issue by September 30, 2009, Government-wide guidance to:

I21(1) govern the appropriate use and oversight of sole-source and other types of noncompetitive contracts and to maximize the use of full and open competition and other competitive procurement processes;

I21(2) govern the appropriate use and oversight of all contract types, in full consideration of the agency's needs, and to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts generally, consistent with the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to section 864 of Public Law 110ÿ09417;

I21(3) assist agencies in assessing the capacity and ability of the Federal acquisition workforce to develop, manage, and oversee acquisitions appropriately; and

I21(4) clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is not appropriate, consistent with section 321 of Public Law 110ÿ09417 (31 U.S.C. 501 note).

I21Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

I21The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

I12(2) a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, the property may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in_

I13(B) unacceptable delay in fulfilling the executive agency's needs.

Q04

I89. Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data

I11(a) T4Provision Requiring Adjustment._

I12(1) T4In generalK._A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime contract) under which a certificate under section 3502(b) of this title is required shall contain a provision that the price of the contract to the Federal Government, including profit or fee, shall be adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be determined by the head of the executive agency that the price was increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to make the certificate available) submitted defective cost or pricing data.

I12(2) T4What constitutes defective cost or pricing dataK._For the purposes of this chapter, defective cost or pricing data are cost or pricing data that, as of the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or another date agreed on between the parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree on a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed on by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.

Q04

I11(b) T4Valid DefenseK._In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it is a defense that the Federal Government did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.

I11(c) T4Invalid DefensesK._It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by subsection (a) that_

I12(1) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor_

I13(A) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or

I13(B) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;

Q04

I12(2) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;

I12(3) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the Federal Government about the total cost of the contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract; or

I12(4) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required by section 3502(b) of this title.

Q04

I11(d) T4Offsets._

I12(1) T4When allowedK._A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) if_

I13(A) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and

I13(B) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in section 3502(c) of this title before that date.

Q04

I12(2) T4When not allowedK._A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under paragraph (1) if_

I13(A) the certification under section 3502(b) of this title with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be false when signed; or

I13(B) the Federal Government proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in paragraph (1)(B) been submitted to the Federal Government before date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, under subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, the submission of the cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.

I12(1) for interest on the amount of the overpayment, to be computed_

I13(A) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor repays the amount of the overpayment to the Federal Government; and

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure effective and efficient expenditure of public funds and fair and expeditious resolution of protests to the award of Federal procurement contracts, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. Heads of executive departments and agencies (``agencies'') engaged in the procurement of supplies and services shall prescribe administrative procedures for the resolution of protests to the award of their procurement contracts as an alternative to protests in fora outside the procuring agencies. Procedures prescribed pursuant to this order shall:

I21(a) emphasize that whenever conduct of a procurement is contested, all parties should use their best efforts to resolve the matter with agency contracting officers;

I21(b) to the maximum extent practicable, provide for inexpensive, informal, procedurally simple, and expeditious resolution of protests, including, where appropriate and as permitted by law, the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques, third party neutrals, and another agency's personnel;

I21(c) allow actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct economic interests would be affected by the award or failure to award the contract to request a review, at a level above the contracting officer, of any decision by a contracting officer that is alleged to have violated a statute or regulation and, thereby, caused prejudice to the protester; and

I21(d) except where immediate contract award or performance is justified for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined to be in the best interest of the United States, prohibit award or performance of the contract while a timely filed protest is pending before the agency. To allow for the withholding of a contract award or performance, the agency must have received notice of the protest within either 10 calendar days after the contract award or 5 calendar days after the bidder or offeror who is protesting the contract award was given the opportunity to be debriefed by the agency, whichever date is later.

I21T4SecK. 2. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall: (a) work with the heads of executive agencies to provide policy guidance and leadership necessary to implement provisions of this order; and

I21(b) review and evaluate agency experience and performance under this order, and report on any findings to the President within 2 years from the date of this order.

I21T4SecK. 3. The Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 C.F.R. 1, within 180 days of the date of this order to further the purposes of this order.

I11(c) T4Notice of AwardK._The award of a contract shall be made by transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to the successful bidder. Within 3 days after the date of contract award, the executive agency shall notify, in writing or by electronic means, each bidder not awarded the contract that the contract has been awarded.

I21``(B) A share-in-savings contract may be awarded for a period greater than five years, but not more than 10 years, if the head of the agency determines in writing prior to award of the contract that_

I22``(i) the level of risk to be assumed and the investment to be undertaken by the contractor is likely to inhibit the government from obtaining the needed information technology competitively at a fair and reasonable price if the contract is limited in duration to a period of five years or less; and

I22``(ii) usage of the information technology to be acquired is likely to continue for a period of time sufficient to generate reasonable benefit for the government.

I21``(3) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be performance-based contracts that identify objective outcomes and contain performance standards that will be used to measure achievement and milestones that must be met before payment is made.

I21``(4) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section shall include a provision containing a quantifiable baseline that is to be the basis upon which a savings share ratio is established that governs the amount of payment a contractor is to receive under the contract. Before commencement of performance of such a contract, the senior procurement executive of the agency shall determine in writing that the terms of the provision are quantifiable and will likely yield value to the Government.

I21``(5)(A) The head of the agency may retain savings realized through the use of a share-in-savings contract under this section that are in excess of the total amount of savings paid to the contractor under the contract, but may not retain any portion of such savings that is attributable to a decrease in the number of civilian employees of the Federal Government performing the function. Except as provided in subparagraph (B), savings shall be credited to the appropriation or fund against which charges were made to carry out the contract and shall be used for information technology.

I21``(B) Amounts retained by the agency under this subsection shall_

I22``(i) without further appropriation, remain available until expended; and

The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid out of_

I22``(A) appropriations available for the performance of the contract;

I22``(B) appropriations available for acquisition of the information technology procured under the contract, and not otherwise obligated; or

I22``(C) funds subsequently appropriated for payments of costs of cancellation or termination, subject to the limitations in paragraph (3).

I21``(2) The amount payable in the event of cancellation or termination of a share-in-savings contract shall be negotiated with the contractor at the time the contract is entered into.

I21``(3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the head of an executive agency may enter into share-in-savings contracts under this section in any given fiscal year even if funds are not made specifically available for the full costs of cancellation or termination of the contract if funds are available and sufficient to make payments with respect to the first fiscal year of the contract and the following conditions are met regarding the funding of cancellation and termination liability:

I22``(i) The amount of unfunded contingent liability for the contract does not exceed the lesser of_

I23``(I) 25 percent of the estimated costs of a cancellation or termination; or

I23``(II) $5,000,000.

I22``(ii) Unfunded contingent liability in excess of $1,000,000 has been approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget or the Director's designee.

I21``(B) The aggregate number of share-in-savings contracts that may be entered into under subparagraph (A) by all executive agencies to which this chapter applies in a fiscal year may not exceed 5 in each of fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005.

I21``(c) T4DefinitionsK._In this section:

I22``(1) The term `contractor' means a private entity that enters into a contract with an agency.

I22``(2) The term `savings' means_

I23``(A) monetary savings to an agency; or

I23``(B) savings in time or other benefits realized by the agency, including enhanced revenues (other than enhanced revenues from the collection of fees, taxes, debts, claims, or other amounts owed the Federal Government).

I22``(3) The term `share-in-savings contract' means a contract under which_

I23``(A) a contractor provides solutions for_

I24``(i) improving the agency's mission-related or administrative processes; or

I24``(ii) accelerating the achievement of agency missions; and

I23``(B) the head of the agency pays the contractor an amount equal to a portion of the savings derived by the agency from_

I24``(i) any improvements in mission-related or administrative processes that result from implementation of the solution; or

I24``(ii) acceleration of achievement of agency missions.

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 T3et seqK., and in order to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Government contracts, it is hereby ordered that:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3PolicyK. This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. When the Federal Government contracts for goods or services, it has a proprietary interest in ensuring that those contracts will be performed by contractors whose work will not be interrupted by labor unrest. The attainment of industrial peace is most easily achieved and workers' productivity is enhanced when workers are well informed of their rights under Federal labor laws, including the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. 151 T3et seqK. As the Act recognizes, ``encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and ... protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection'' will ``eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce'' and ``mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred.'' 29 U.S.C. 151. Relying on contractors whose employees are informed of such rights under Federal labor laws facilitates the efficient and economical completion of the Federal Government's contracts.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3Contract ClauseK. Except in contracts exempted in accordance with section 3 of this order, all Government contracting departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, include the following provisions in every Government contract, other than collective bargaining agreements as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(8) and purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 403.

I21``1. During the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to post a notice, of such size and in such form, and containing such content as the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe, in conspicuous places in and about its plants and offices where employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act engage in activities relating to the performance of the contract, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted both physically and electronically. The notice shall include the information contained in the notice published by the Secretary of Labor in the Federal Register (Secretary's Notice).

I21``2. The contractor will comply with all provisions of the Secretary's Notice, and related rules, regulations, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.

I21``3. In the event that the contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) or (2) above, this contract may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in or adopted pursuant to Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided in Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]], or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as are otherwise provided by law.

I21``4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) above in every subcontract entered into in connection with this contract (unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]) so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: Provided, however, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.''

I21T4SecK. 3. T3AdministrationK.

I21(a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary shall adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.

I21(b) Within 120 days of the effective date of this order, the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking to prescribe the size, form, and content of the notice to be posted by a contractor under paragraph 1 of the contract clause described in section 2 of this order. Such notice shall describe the rights of employees under Federal labor laws, consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.

I21(c) Whenever the Secretary finds that an act of Congress, clarification of existing law by the courts or the National Labor Relations Board, or other circumstances make modification of the contractual provisions set out in subsection (a) of this section necessary to achieve the purposes of this order, the Secretary promptly shall issue such rules, regulations, or orders as are needed to cause the substitution or addition of appropriate contractual provisions in Government contracts thereafter entered into.

I21T4SecK. 4. T3ExemptionsK. (a) If the Secretary finds that the application of any of the requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of this order or would impair the ability of the Government to procure goods or services on an economical and efficient basis, the Secretary may exempt a contracting department or agency or group of departments or agencies from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of this order with respect to a particular contract or subcontract or any class of contracts or subcontracts.

I21(b) The Secretary may, if the Secretary finds that special circumstances require an exemption in order to serve the national interest, exempt a contracting department or agency from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of section 2 of this order with respect to a particular contract or subcontract or class of contracts or subcontracts.

I21T4SecK. 5. T3InvestigationK.

I21Such investigations shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.

I21(b) The Secretary shall receive and investigate complaints by employees of a Government contractor or subcontractor, where such complaints allege a failure to perform or a violation of the contractual provisions required by section 2 of this order.

I21(a) The Secretary, or any agency or officer in the executive branch lawfully designated by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary, may hold such hearings, public or private, regarding compliance with this order as the Secretary may deem advisable.

I21(b) The Secretary may hold hearings, or cause hearings to be held, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, prior to imposing, ordering, or recommending the imposition of sanctions under this order. Neither an order for cancellation, termination, or suspension of any contract or debarment of any contractor from further Government contracts under section 7(b) of this order nor the inclusion of a contractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors under section 7(c) of this order shall be carried out without affording the contractor an opportunity for a hearing.

I21T4SecK. 7. T3RemediesK. In accordance with such rules, regulations, or orders as the Secretary may issue or adopt, the Secretary may:

I21(b) after consulting with each affected contracting department or agency, provide that one or more contracting departments or agencies shall refrain from entering into further contracts, or extensions or other modifications of existing contracts, with any noncomplying contractor, until such contractor has satisfied the Secretary that such contractor has complied with and will carry out the provisions of this order: Provided, that before issuing a directive under this subsection, the Secretary shall provide the head of each contracting department or agency an opportunity to offer written objections to the issuance of such a directive, which objections shall include a complete statement of reasons for the objections, among which reasons shall be a finding that further contracts or extensions or other modifications of existing contracts with the noncomplying contractor are essential to the agency's mission: And provided further, that no directive shall be issued by the Secretary under this subsection so long as the head of a contracting department or agency, or his or her designee, continues to object to the issuance of such directive; and

I86Ex. Ord. No. T113502K. Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects

I21Ex. Ord. No. 13502, Feb. 6, 2009, 74 F.R. 6985, provided:

I21By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 T3et seqK., and in order to promote the efficient administration and completion of Federal construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3PolicyK. (a) Large-scale construction projects pose special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal Government. Construction employers typically do not have a permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts being performed. Challenges also arise due to the fact that construction projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location. A labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project. A lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can create frictions and disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon resolution mechanism. These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors. On larger projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.

I21(b) The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these problems from developing by providing structure and stability to large-scale construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient and expeditious completion of Federal construction contracts. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government to encourage executive agencies to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3DefinitionsK.

I21(a) The term ``labor organization'' as used in this order means a labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5).

I21(b) The term ``construction'' as used in this order means construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, or improvement of buildings, highways, or other real property.

I21(c) The term ``large-scale construction project'' as used in this order means a construction project where the total cost to the Federal Government is $25 million or more.

I21(d) The term ``executive agency'' as used in this order has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but excludes the Government Accountability Office.

I21(e) The term ``project labor agreement'' as used in this order means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).

I21T4SecK. 3. (a) In awarding any contract in connection with a large-scale construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a contract, executive agencies may, on a project-by-project basis, require the use of a project labor agreement by a contractor where use of such an agreement will (i) advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters, and (ii) be consistent with law.

I21(b) If an executive agency determines under subsection (a) that the use of a project labor agreement will satisfy the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor or subcontractor on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate labor organizations.

I21T4SecK. 4. Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to this order shall:

I21(a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the Construction project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;

I21(b) allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements;

I21(c) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job disruptions;

I21(d) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for resolving labor disputes arising during the project labor agreement;

I21(e) provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality of work, safety, and health; and

I21(f) fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders.

I21T4SecK. 5. This order does not require an executive agency to use a project labor agreement on any construction project, nor does it preclude the use of a project labor agreement in circumstances not covered by this order, including leasehold arrangements and projects receiving Federal financial assistance. This order also does not require contractors or subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any particular labor organization.

I21T4SecK. 6. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), to the extent permitted by law, shall take whatever action is required to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the provisions of this order.

I21T4SecK. 7. The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and with other officials as appropriate, shall provide the President within 180 days of this order, recommendations about whether broader use of project labor agreements, with respect to both construction projects undertaken under Federal contracts and construction projects receiving Federal financial assistance, would help to promote the economical, efficient, and timely completion of such projects.

I21T4SecK. 8. T3Revocation of Prior Orders, Rules, and RegulationsK. Executive Order 13202 of February 17, 2001, and Executive Order 13208 of April 6, 2001, are revoked. The heads of executive agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, revoke expeditiously any orders, rules, or regulations implementing Executive Orders 13202 and 13208.

I21T4SecK. 9. T3SeverabilityK. If any provision of this order, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

I21T4SecK. 10. T3GeneralK. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

I22(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or

I22(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

I21(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

I21(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

I21T4SecK. 11. T3Effective DateK. This order shall be effective immediately and shall apply to all solicitations for contracts issued on or after the effective date of the action taken by the FAR Council under section 6 of this order.

I11(b) T4Penalty for Violation of Cost Principle._

I12(1) T4Unallowable cost in proposalK._If the executive agency determines that a cost submitted by a contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to_

I13(A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted; plus

I13(B) interest (to be computed based on provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation) to compensate the Federal Government for the use of the amount which a contractor has been paid in excess of the amount to which the contractor was entitled.

Q04

I12(2) T4Cost determined to be unallowable before proposal submittedK._If the executive agency determines that a proposal for settlement of indirect costs submitted by a contractor includes a cost determined to be unallowable in the case of that contractor before the submission of that proposal, the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to 2 times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has been submitted.

Q04

I11(c) T4Waiver of PenaltyK._The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty under subsection (b) to be waived in the case of a contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs when_

I12(1) the contractor withdraws the proposal before the formal initiation of an audit of the proposal by the Federal Government and resubmits a revised proposal;

I12(2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is insignificant; or

I12(3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's satisfaction, that_

I13(A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs; and

I13(B) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the proposal.

Q04

No petition seeking such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of the executive agency. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5.

I21In subsection (a), before paragraph (1), the words ``In this section'' are substituted for ``as used in this Act'' as the probable intent of Congress. Section 9(a) of the Act of August 2, 1946 (ch. 744, 60 Stat. 809) restated 41:5 generally and section 9(c) of the Act, an independent provision, was editorially added as the last paragraph of 41:5. The definitions which apply to ``as used in this Act'' are probably intended to apply also to 41:5 as restated by the Act. The definitions for ``department'' and ``continental United States'' are omitted because those terms do not appear in 41:5. In paragraph (1), the words ``section 9104 of title 31'' are substituted for ``section 104 of the Government Corporation Control Act, approved December 6, 1945'' because of section 4(b) of Public Law. 97ÿ09258 (31 U.S.C. note prec. 101). In paragraphs (1) and (2), the word ``includes'' is substituted for ``shall be construed to include'' and for ``shall be construed as including'', respectively, to eliminate unnecessary words.

I21In subsection (c), the words ``as authorized by section 29 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1638)'' in section 3709 of the Revised Statutes are omitted because section 29 was repealed by section 602(a)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (ch. 288, 63 Stat. 399).

I11(b) T4Assignment._

I12(1) T4In generalK._Notwithstanding subsection (a) and in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, amounts due from the Federal Government under a contract may be assigned to a bank, trust company, Federal lending agency, or other financing institution.

I13(A) T4Contract provisionK._A contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy, or another department or agency of the Federal Government designated by the President may, on a determination of need by the President, provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments made to an assignee under the contract are not subject to reduction or setoff.

I14(iv) on account of penalties; or

I14(v) on account of taxes, social security contributions, or the withholding or non-withholding of taxes or social security contributions, whether arising from or independently of the contract.

The words ``A purported transfer in violation of this subsection'' are substituted for ``any such transfer'' because an actual transfer is precluded by this provision.

I21In subsection (b)(1), the words ``amounts due from the Federal Government'' are substituted for ``moneys due or to become due from the United States or from any agency or department thereof'' to eliminate unnecessary words.

The words ``an assignor's liability to the Federal Government'' are substituted for ``liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any department or agency thereofÿ1A'' for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

I21In subsection (b)(9)(A), the words ``except any such contract under which full payment has been made'' are omitted as unnecessary because subsection (b)(8) precludes refund where full payment has already been made. The words ``payments made to an assignee under the contract'' are substituted for ``payments to be made to the assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract'' to eliminate unnecessary words.

I21In subsection (b)(9)(B), the words ``When a `no reduction or setoffÿ1A' provision as described in subparagraph (A) is included in a contract'' are substituted for ``If a provision described in subsection (e) of this section or a provision to the same general effect has been at any time heretofore or is hereafter included or inserted in any such contract'', the words ``payments to the assignee'' are substituted for ``payments to be made thereafter to an assignee of any moneys due or to become due'', and the words ``an assignor's liability'' are substituted for ``any liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any department or agency thereofÿ1A'', for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

I21In subsection (a), the words ``Air Force'' are added because of section 207(a) and (f) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 502, 503). Section 207(a) and (f) was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 676). Section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 1) enacted Title 10, ``Armed Forces'' and under subtitle D of title 10 the Department of the Air Force remained an independent administrative entity in the Department of Defense.

I21Subsection (b)(2)(B) is set out as a separate provision to clarify that the certification applies only to contracts other than contracts with the Federal Government. If the certification were to be construed as applying to all contracts, then the words ``under a contract with the United States or'' in section 2 of the Act of June 22, 1942, would be rendered meaningless.

I21In subsection (b)(2)(B), the words ``Secretary of the Army'' are substituted for ``Secretary of War'', and the words ``Secretary of the Air Force'' are added, because of sections 205(a) and 207(a) and (f) of the National Security Act of 1947 (ch. 343, 61 Stat. 501, 502, 503). Sections 205(a) and 207(a) and (f) were repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (ch. 1041, 70A Stat. 676). Section 1 of the Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 1) enacted Title 10, ``Armed Forces'' and under sections 3010 to 3013 and 8010 to 8013 the Departments of the Army and Air Force remained under the administrative supervision of the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force, respectively. The words ``Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating'' are substituted for ``Secretary of Transportation'' because of 6:468(b) and (h), 551(d), and 552(d), 14:1 and 3, and the Department of Homeland Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002 (H.

I22(2) the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the United States threshold specified in the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or NAFTA, whichever is applicable.

I21In the matter before paragraph (1), the words ``and entered into'' are omitted as unnecessary.

I21In paragraph (1), the words ``under the contract'' are substituted for ``used in the performance of the contract'' in 41:35(a) to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter. The words ``Sections 35 to 45 of this title shall apply to all contracts entered into pursuant to invitations for bids issued on or after ninety days from June 30, 1936'' in 41:45 are omitted as obsolete.

I21In paragraph (2), the words ``under the contract'' are substituted for ``used in the performance of the contract'' to eliminate unnecessary words and for consistency in the chapter.

I21In paragraph (3), the words ``No individual under 16 years of age'' are substituted for ``no male person under sixteen years of age and no female person under eighteen years of age'' to reflect the interpretation of this provision subsequent to enactment of civil rights laws such as section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42:2000eÿ092), as carried out by the Department of Labor through 41 C.F.R. Part 50ÿ09201.104. The words ``incarcerated individual'' are substituted for ``convict labor'' the first time the words appear because the term ``convict labor'' is ambiguous and may be interpreted to include individuals who are not incarcerated. This would be an inappropriate interpretation because 41:35(c) provides an exception for ``convict labor'' that satisfies the conditions of 18:1761(c) regarding certain non-Federal prison work projects. The words ``or production'' are omitted for consistency with the source provisions for paragraphs (1) and (2) and because, in this context, the concept of ``production'' is included in the words ``manufacture or furnishing''. The words ``under the contract'' are substituted for ``included in such contract'' for consistency in the chapter.

On order of the Secretary, the amount shall be paid directly to the underpaid employee on whose account the amount was withheld or recovered. However, an employee's claim for payment under this subsection may be entertained only if made within one year from the date of actual notice to the contractor of the withholding or recovery.

I11(b) T4Three-Year ProhibitionK._Unless the Secretary recommends otherwise, a contract described in section 6502 of this title may not be awarded to a person named on the list under subsection (a), or to a firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which the person has a controlling interest, until 3 years have elapsed from the date of the determination by the Secretary that a breach or violation occurred.

I21In subsection (b), the words ``contract described in section 6502 of this title'' are substituted for ``contracts'' to clarify the scope of the prohibition. The words ``the date of the determination by the Secretary that a breach or violation occurred'' are substituted for ``the date the Secretary of Labor determines such breach to have occurred'' to clarify that the three-year period begins with the date of the Secretary's determination and not with the date of the breach or violation.

I21In subsection (c), the words ``and to prescribe rules and regulations with respect thereto'' are omitted as unnecessary because of subsection (b).

I21In subsection (d), the words ``without regard to the provisions of the civil-service laws'', which appear in section 4 of the Walsh-Healey Act (June 30, 1936, ch. 881, 49 Stat. 2038), are omitted as obsolete because of Executive Order 8743, April 23, 1941 (5 U.S.C. 3301 note), issued by the President pursuant to the Act of November 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I, ÿ1A1, 54 Stat. 1211.

I11(a) T4Record and Hearing Requirements for Wage DeterminationsK._A wage determination under section 6502(1) of this title shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing.

I11(b) T4Authority To Hold HearingsK._The Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary may hold hearings when there is a complaint of breach or violation of a representation or stipulation included in a contract under section 6502 of this title. The Secretary may initiate hearings on the Secretary's own motion or on the application of a person affected by the ruling of an agency of the United States relating to a proposal or contract under this chapter.

I11(c) T4Orders To Compel TestimonyK._The Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary may issue orders requiring witnesses to attend hearings held under this section and to produce evidence and testify under oath. Witnesses shall be paid fees and mileage at the same rates as witnesses in courts of the United States.

I11(d) T4Enforcement of OrdersK._If a person refuses or fails to obey an order issued under subsection (c), the Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary may bring an action to enforce the order in a district court of the United States or in the district court of a territory or possession of the United States. A court has jurisdiction to enforce the order if the inquiry is being carried out within the court's judicial district or if the person is found or resides or transacts business within the court's judicial district. The court may issue an order requiring the person to obey the order issued under subsection (c), and the court may punish any further refusal or failure as contempt of court.

I11(e) T4Findings of FactK._After notice and a hearing, the Secretary or an impartial representative designated by the Secretary shall make findings of fact. The findings are conclusive for agencies of the United States. If supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the findings are conclusive in any court of the United States.

I21In subsection (d), the word ``contumacy'' is omitted as included in ``refuses or fails''. The words ``may bring an action to enforce the order'' are substituted for ``upon the application by'' for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words ``the United States District Court for the District of Columbia'' in section 5 of the Act of June 30, 1936 (which were substituted for ``the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia'' by section 32(b) of the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 646, 62 Stat. 991), as amended by section 127 of the Act of May 24, 1949 (ch. 139, 63 Stat. 107), and which were editorially omitted from 41:39) are omitted as included in ``a district court of the United States'' because of sections 88 and 132(a) of title 28, United States Code. The words ``within the court's judicial district''' are substituted for ``within the jurisdiction of which'' for clarity and for consistency in the revised title and with other titles of the United States Code. The words ``requiring the person to obey the order issued under subsection (c)'' are substituted for ``requiring such person to appear before him or representative designated by him, to produce evidence if, as, and when so ordered, and to give testimony relating to the matter under investigation or in question'' for clarity and to eliminate unnecessary words.

I21In subsection (e), the duty to make findings of fact is restated as a duty of the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative). The grammatical structure of the last sentence of 41:39 seems to suggest that the court, rather than the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative), serves as fact finder. However, the provision taken as a whole indicates that it is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) who serves as fact finder. It is the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) before whom hearings are held, witnesses testify, and evidence is produced. The court's involvement is limited to compelling recalcitrant witnesses ``to appear before him [the Secretary] or representative designated by him''. The restatement clarifies the generally accepted understanding that the Secretary (or the Secretary's representative) serves as fact finder (see, e.g., T3United States v. Sweet BriarK, 92 F. Supp. 777, 780 (W.D.S.C. 1950) (``the Secretary `shall make findings of fact'ÿ1A''); T3Ready-Mix Concrete Company v. United StatesK, 158 F. Supp. 571, 578 (Cl.

I11(b) T4Authority of the Secretary To Modify Existing ContractsK._When an agency of the United States and a contractor jointly recommend, the Secretary may modify the terms of an existing contract with respect to minimum wages and maximum hours of labor as the Secretary finds necessary and proper in the public interest or to prevent injustice and undue hardship.

I11(c) T4Authority of the Secretary To Allow Limitations, Variations, Tolerances, and ExemptionsK._The Secretary may provide reasonable limitations and may prescribe regulations to allow reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions in the application of this chapter to contractors, including with respect to minimum wages and maximum hours of labor.

I11(d) T4Rate of Pay for OvertimeK._When the Secretary permits an increase in the maximum hours of labor stipulated in a contract, the Secretary shall set a rate of pay for overtime. The overtime rate must be at least one and one-half times the basic hourly rate.

I11(e) T4Authority of the President To SuspendK._The President may suspend any of the representations and stipulations contained in section 6502 of this title whenever, in the President's judgment, suspension is in the public interest.

I11(c) T4Judicial Review of Wage DeterminationsK._A person adversely affected or aggrieved by a wage determination under section 6502(1) of this title has the right of judicial review of the determination, or of the applicability of the determination, within 90 days after the determination is made, in the manner provided by chapter 7 of title 5.

I21Paragraph (2) is substituted for ``the Act entitled `An Act relating to the rate of wages for laborers and mechanics employed on public buildings of the United States and the District of Columbia by contractors and subcontractors, and for other purposes', approved March 3, 1931 (commonly known as the Bacon-Davis Act), as amended from time to time'' because of section 5(c) of Public Law 107ÿ09217 (40 U.S.C. note prec. 101) and for consistency with title 40.

I21The words ``the labor provisions of Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933, as extended'' are omitted as obsolete because of section 201 of the Act of June 21, 1938 (ch. 554, 52 Stat. 816), as amended by the Acts of June 27, 1940 (ch. 437, 54 Stat. 633), April 5, 1941 (ch. 40, 55 Stat. 110), and June 27, 1942 (ch. 450, 56 Stat. 410).

I21The words ``or [the labor provisions] of section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, approved April 8, 1935'' are omitted as obsolete. The intended reference was probably to section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 118). Section 7 of the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 provided that the President shall require certain rates of pay for persons engaged in carrying out projects that were financed by amounts being appropriated in that Act.

I21Paragraph (3) is substituted for ``the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the diversification of employment of Federal prisoners, for their training and schooling in trades and occupations, and for other purposes', approved May 27, 1930, as amended and supplemented by the Act approved June 23, 1934'' for consistency with title 18. The Act of May 27, 1930 (ch. 340, 46 Stat. 391) and the Act of June 23, 1934 (ch. 736, 48 Stat. 1211), which were classified to sections 744a to 744n of former title 18, were substantially repealed and were replaced by chapter 307 and section 4162 of title 18 in the codification of title 18 by the Act of June 25, 1948 (ch. 645, 62 Stat. 683). Subsequently, section 4162 of title 18 was repealed by section 218(a)(4) of Public Law 98ÿ09473 (98 Stat. 2027).

I21In paragraph (3), the word ``individual'' is substituted for ``person'' because of the definition of ``person'' in 1:1.

The words ``Eniwetok Atoll, Kwajalein Atoll'' are omitted because they are part of the Marshall Islands and therefore no longer part of the United States.

I86Ex. Ord. No. T113495K. Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts

I21Ex. Ord. No. 13495, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6103, provided:

I21When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is awarded for the same service, at the same location, the successor contractor or its subcontractors often hires the majority of the predecessor's employees. On some occasions, however, a successor contractor or its subcontractors hires a new work force, thus displacing the predecessor's employees.

I21The Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are served when the successor contractor hires the predecessor's employees. A carryover work force reduces disruption to the delivery of services during the period of transition between contractors and provides the Federal Government the benefits of an experienced and trained work force that is familiar with the Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements.

I21Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 T3et seqK., and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:

I21T4SectionK 1. T3PolicyK. It is the policy of the Federal Government that service contracts and solicitations for such contracts shall include a clause that requires the contractor, and its subcontractors, under a contract that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services at the same location, to offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. There shall be no employment openings under the contract until such right of first refusal has been provided. Nothing in this order shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive Order or law of the United States.

I21T4SecK. 2. T3DefinitionsK.

I21(a) ``Service contract'' or ``contract'' means any contract or subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its contractors that is covered by the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 351 T3et seqK., and its implementing regulations.

I21(b) ``Employee'' means a service employee as defined in the Service Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. 357(b).

I21T4SecK. 3. T3ExclusionsK. This order shall not apply to:

I21(a) contracts or subcontracts under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in 41 U.S.C. 403;

I21(b) contracts or subcontracts awarded pursuant to the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 46ÿ0948c;

I21(c) guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services provided to the Federal Government under contracts or subcontracts with sheltered workshops employing the severely handicapped as described in section 505 of the Treasury, Postal Services [sic] and General Government Appropriations Act, 1995, Public Law 103ÿ09329;

I21(d) agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to the preference regulations issued under the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107; or

I21(e) employees who were hired to work under a Federal service contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a single job, provided that the employees were not deployed in a manner that was designed to avoid the purposes of this order.

I21T4SecK. 4. T3Authority to Exempt ContractsK. If the head of a contracting department or agency finds that the application of any of the requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of this order or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis, the head of such department or agency may exempt its department or agency from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of this order with respect to a particular contract, subcontract, or purchase order or any class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders.

I21T4SecK. 5. T3Contract ClauseK. The following contract clause shall be included in solicitations for and service contracts that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar work at the same location:

I21``NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS

I21``(a) Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise provided herein, in good faith offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this contract in positions for which employees are qualified. The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine the number of employees necessary for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work. Except as provided in paragraph (b) there shall be no employment opening under this contract, and the contractor and any subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. The contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the time within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall the period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment be less than 10 days.

I21``(b) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) above, the contractor and any subcontractors (1) may employ under this contract any employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least 3 months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (2) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 357(b), and (3) are not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor whom the contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job.

I21``(c) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222ÿ0941(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. The Contracting Officer will provide the list to the successor contractor, and the list shall be provided on request to employees or their representatives.

I21``(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order (No.) G7T2XXXXXK [13495], the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.

I21``(e) In every subcontract entered into in order to perform services under this contract, the contractor will include provisions that ensure that each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b) with respect to the employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its subcontractors. The subcontract shall also include provisions to ensure that the subcontractor will provide the contractor with the information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the contractor to comply with paragraph 5(c), above. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the contractor may request that the United States enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.''

I21In subsection (a), the word ``only'' is omitted for consistency with a similar provision in 41:608(a) and because the word ``only'' is redundant with the word ``sole''.

I21In subsection (b)(6), the words ``from time to time, may review'' are substituted for ``is authorized to review at least every three years'' because the source law, while effectively granting the Administrator authority to conduct the reviews, does not require the Administrator to conduct any reviews, and does not restrict the number of reviews the Administrator may conduct during any time period. The words ``beginning with the third year after November 1, 1978'' are omitted as obsolete. The words ``the dollar amount specified in paragraph (1)'' are substituted for ``the dollar amount defined in subsection (a) of this section as a small claim'' to eliminate unnecessary words and because 41:608(a), restated as paragraph (1), does not explicitly provide a definition for the term ``small claim''.

Although the Renegotiation Board is no longer in existence, Federal agencies, including the General Services Administration, are required to use interest rates that are computed under the criteria set out in this subsection. See 31:3902(a) and the website of the Bureau of the Public Debt, available at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdprmt2.htm.

I21T4SecK. 2. (a) For the purposes of this order materials shall be considered to be of foreign origin if the cost of the foreign products used in such materials constitutes fifty per centum or more of the cost of all the products used in such materials.

I21(b) For the purposes of the said act of March 3, 1933 [probably means act Mar. 3, 1933, ch. 212, title III, 47 Stat. 1520, see 41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.], and the other laws referred to in the first paragraph of the preamble of this order, the bid or offered price of materials of domestic origin shall be deemed to be unreasonable, or the purchase of such materials shall be deemed to be inconsistent with the public interest, if the bid or offered price thereof exceeds the sum of the bid or offered price of like materials of foreign origin and a differential computed as provided in subsection (c) of this section.

I21(c) The executive agency concerned shall in each instance determine the amount of the differential referred to in subsection (b) of this section on the basis of one of the following-described formulas, subject to the terms thereof:

I21(1) The sum determined by computing six per centum of the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin.

I21(2) The sum determined by computing ten per centum of the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin exclusive of applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States: provided that when the bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin amounts to less than $25,000, the sum shall be determined by computing ten per centum of such price exclusive only of applicable duty.

I21T4SecK. 3. Nothing in this order shall affect the authority or responsibility of an executive agency:

I21(a) To reject any bid or offer for reasons of the national interest not described or referred to in this order; or

I21(b) To place a fair proportion of the total purchases with small business concerns in accordance with section 302(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [former 41 U.S.C. 252(b)] [now 41 U.S.C. 3104], [former] section 2(b) of the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, as amended, and [former] section 202 of the Small Business Act of 1953; or

I21(c) To reject a bid or offer to furnish material of foreign origin in any situation in which the domestic supplier offering the lowest price for furnishing the desired materials undertakes to produce substantially all of such materials in areas of substantial unemployment, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with such appropriate regulations as he may establish and during such period as the President may determine that it is in the national interest to provide to such areas preference in the award of Government contracts: T3ProvidedK, that nothing in this section shall prevent the rejection of a bid or offered price which is excessive; or

I21(d) To reject any bid or offer for materials of foreign origin if such rejection is necessary to protect essential national-security interests after receiving advice with respect thereto from the President or from the Director [now Administrator] of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In providing this advice the Director [Administrator] shall be governed by the principle that exceptions under this section shall be made only upon a clear showing that the payment of a greater differential than the procedures of this section generally prescribe is justified by consideration of national security.

I21T4SecK. 4. The head of each executive agency shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to insure that procurement practices under his jurisdiction conform to the provisions of this order.

I21T4SecK. 5. This order shall apply only to contracts entered into after the date hereof. In any case in which the head of an executive agency proposing to purchase domestic materials determines that a greater differential than that provided in this order between the cost of such materials of domestic origin and materials of foreign origin is not unreasonable or that the purchase of materials of domestic origin is not inconsistent with the public interest, this order shall not apply. A written report of the facts of each case in which such a determination is made shall be submitted to the President through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget by the official making the determination within 30 days thereafter.

However, section 502(a)(2) of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (48 U.S.C. 1801 note) provided that laws in existence on the effective date of section 502 that were applicable to Guam and that were of general application to the several States would apply to the Northern Mariana Islands. The Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia are not included because although they were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, they are independent entities and not part of the United States.

I21In subsection (b)(1)(F), the words ``Department of Education'' are substituted for ``Department of Health and Human Services'' in 41:46(a)(1) to correct a mistake in the United States Code. In the amendment to the original provision by section 1 of Public Law 92ÿ0928 (85 Stat. 77), an officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was one of the members appointed to the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, because the Department, through the Rehabilitation Services Administration, had the major governmental function in the field of vocational rehabilitation for the blind and other severely handicapped and administered related vocational rehabilitation programs for individuals with disabilities. See House Report 92ÿ09228. Under section 301(a)(4)(A) and (C) and (b)(3) of the Department of Education Organization Act (20:3441(a)(4)(A) and (C) and (b)(3)), the functions and offices of the Department and the functions of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services were transferred to the Department or Secretary of Education. Section 509 of the Act (20:3508) redesignated the Department and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare as the Department and Secretary of Health and Human Services, respectively, and provided that references to the Department and Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare were deemed to be references to the Department or Secretary of Health and Human Services except to the extent a reference was to a function of the Department or Secretary of Education. The reference in 41:46(a)(1) was changed to ``Department of Health and Human Services'' but should have been changed to ``Department of Education''. Furthermore, the regulations of the Committee include the Department of Education in the list of members of the Committee. See 41 CFR 51ÿ092.1.

I21In subsection (c), the text of 41:46(d)(2) and (4) is omitted as obsolete.

I21In subsection (f)(1), the reference to section 5376 of title 5 is substituted for the reference to grade GSÿ0918 of the General Schedule because of section 529 [title I, ÿ1A101(c)(1)] of the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101ÿ09509, 104 Stat. 1442, 5 U.S.C. 5376 note). The word ``actual'' is omitted as unnecessary. The words ``A member is entitled to travel expenses, including a per diem allowance instead of subsistence, as provided under section 5703 of title 5'' are substituted for 41:46(e)(3) to eliminate unnecessary words. The reference to section 5703 of title 5 is substituted for the reference to section 5703(b) of title 5 because of the amendment to section 5703 by section 4 of the Travel Expense Amendments Act of 1975 (Public Law 94ÿ0922, 89 Stat. 85).

I21In subsection (g), the words ``its duties and powers'' are omitted as surplus.

I21In subsection (g)(1), the reference to chapter 33 of title 5 is substituted for ``the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service'' for clarity and for consistency with other titles of the United States Code. The words ``relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates'' are omitted as unnecessary.

I21In subsection (j), the words ``and to the Congress'' are omitted pursuant to section 3003 of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (31 U.S.C. 1113 note). See, also, page 199 of House Document No. 103ÿ097.
